2431,"Default Mode Connectivity in Major Depressive Disorder Measured Up to 10 Days After Ketamine Administration.^
BACKGROUND: The symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) are rapidly alleviated by administration of a single dose of the glutamatergic modulator ketamine. However, few studies have investigated the potential sustained neural effects of this agent beyond immediate infusion. This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the effect of a single ketamine infusion on the resting state default mode network (DMN) at 2 and 10 days after a single ketamine infusion in unmedicated subjects with MDD as well as healthy control subjects (HCs). METHODS: Data were drawn from a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of 58 participants (33 with MDD and 25 HCs) who received an intravenous infusion of either ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo on 2 separate test days spaced 2 weeks apart. Eight minutes of functional magnetic resonance imaging resting state data was acquired at baseline and at about 2 and 10 days after both infusions. The DMN was defined using seed-based correlation and was compared across groups and scans. RESULTS: In subjects with MDD, connectivity between the insula and the DMN was normalized compared with HCs 2 days postketamine infusion. This change was reversed after 10 days and did not appear in either of the placebo scans. Group-specific connectivity differences in drug response were observed, most notably in the insula in subjects with MDD and in the thalamus in HCs. CONCLUSIONS: Connectivity changes in the insula in subjects with MDD suggest that ketamine may normalize the interaction between the DMN and salience networks, supporting the triple network dysfunction model of MDD.","###Task

Your task is to generate an HTML version of an input text, marking up specific entities. The entities to be identified are: Application area, Dosage. Use HTML <span> tags to highlight these entities. Each <span> should have a class attribute indicating the type of entity.

###Entity Markup Guide
Use <span class=""application-area""> to denote Application area, <span class=""dosage""> to denote Dosage.

###Entity Defintions
Application area is defined as: The condition or disease of interest studied under the impact of the psychedelic substance in the present paper.

Dosage is defined as: The applied dosage(s) of the psychedelic substance(s) in the present study.

###Annotation Guidelines
Application area should be annotated according to the following criteria:
* Our working definition for the Application is any ""state labeled as diseases by virtue of consensus on prevalent sociocultural and medical values"". It has to have ""clearly identifiable diagnostic features and disease progression, and response to specific treatment.""
* As a general guideline, annotated entities should be conditions that have an ICD-10/11 code.
* Annotate only in title and/or the introductory part of the abstract, i.e., when the problem or objective of the study is discussed (including abbreviations). Do NOT annotate outcomes, such as ""the Hamilton Depression Scale"" should not be annotated. Similarly, ""antisuicidal response"" should not be annotated. Or: ""among participants, depression was reduced"", do NOT annotate depression.
* Do NOT annotate antidepressant.
* Do not annotate over brackets: ""…or bipolar disorder (BD) type 1 and type 2"", only bipolar disorder and BD should be annotated as two entities.
* Do NOT annotate very generic concepts like ""psychiatric condition""
* Annotate sweeping statements like ""…with major depressive and bipolar disorder"" as one entity.
* Annotate the reasonably necessary string, e.g., ""active suicidal ideation"", active suicidal ideation should be annotated. However, adjectives could be annotated, ""Depressed patients"", annotate Depressed but not patients. ""depressive symptoms"" should both be annotated (also symptoms of depression). In ""refractory anxiety disorder"", annotate the entire string.
* Further defining characteristics should be included: Acute/Chronic; Active/Inactive; Mild/Moderate/Severe; End Stage/Early Stage; Drug-resistant; Total/Partial; Intermittent/Relapsing and others. Similarly, ""Post-stroke"" should be annotated instead of only ""stroke"" because it refers to the phase after the acute stroke.
* Annotate abbreviations. Abbreviations should be annotated  separately. For instance,""Huntington disease (HD)""should be separated into two annotations: ""Huntington disease"" and ""HD.
* Of note, in ""Managing dissociative symptoms following esketamine"", dissociative symptoms are NOT the treatment target but the target of the study and should NOT be annotated (context is relevant).
* Cigarette addiction is a disorder but not smoking cessation.
* Can be empty, i.e., no annotation per abstract.
* Include .^ in the title for highlighting

Dosage should be annotated according to the following criteria:
* Only annotate for studies testing not more than 1 psychedelic substance (e.g., do not annotate in a study testing lsd and psilocybin, BUT annotate in a study testing psilocybin against midazolam)
* Do NOT annotate doses of other substances or of the psychedelic substance in other studies (e.g, mentioned by referencing other studies)
* Do not annotate concentrations of solutions but dosages, i.e., do NOT annotate 500mg/10 ml, but annotate 2mg/kg.
* Annotate the number and the corresponding unit.

933,"Resting-state Network-specific Breakdown of Functional Connectivity during Ketamine Alteration of Consciousness in Volunteers.^
BACKGROUND: Consciousness-altering anesthetic agents disturb connectivity between brain regions composing the resting-state consciousness networks (RSNs). The default mode network (DMn), executive control network, salience network (SALn), auditory network, sensorimotor network (SMn), and visual network sustain mentation. Ketamine modifies consciousness differently from other agents, producing psychedelic dreaming and no apparent interaction with the environment. The authors used functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore ketamine-induced changes in RSNs connectivity. METHODS: Fourteen healthy volunteers received stepwise intravenous infusions of ketamine up to loss of responsiveness. Because of agitation, data from six subjects were excluded from analysis. RSNs connectivity was compared between absence of ketamine (wake state [W1]), light ketamine sedation, and ketamine-induced unresponsiveness (deep sedation [S2]). RESULTS: Increasing the depth of ketamine sedation from W1 to S2 altered DMn and SALn connectivity and suppressed the anticorrelated activity between DMn and other brain regions. During S2, DMn connectivity, particularly between the medial prefrontal cortex and the remaining network (effect size β [95% CI]: W1 = 0.20 [0.18 to 0.22]; S2 = 0.07 [0.04 to 0.09]), and DMn anticorrelated activity (e.g., right sensory cortex: W1 = -0.07 [-0.09 to -0.04]; S2 = 0.04 [0.01 to 0.06]) were broken down. SALn connectivity was nonuniformly suppressed (e.g., left parietal operculum: W1 = 0.08 [0.06 to 0.09]; S2 = 0.05 [0.02 to 0.07]). Executive control networks, auditory network, SMn, and visual network were minimally affected. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine induces specific changes in connectivity within and between RSNs. Breakdown of frontoparietal DMn connectivity and DMn anticorrelation and sensory and SMn connectivity preservation are common to ketamine and propofol-induced alterations of consciousness.","###Task

8870,"Oxytocin receptor gene variations and socio-emotional effects of MDMA: A pooled analysis of controlled studies in healthy subjects.^
Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) increases oxytocin, empathy, and prosociality. Oxytocin plays a critical role in emotion processing and social behavior and has been shown to mediate the prosocial effects of MDMA in animals. Genetic variants, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) may influence the emotional and social effects of MDMA in humans. The effects of common genetic variants of the OXTR (rs53576, rs1042778, and rs2254298 SNPs) on the emotional, empathogenic, and prosocial effects of MDMA were characterized in up to 132 healthy subjects in a pooled analysis of eight double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. In a subset of 53 subjects, MDMA produced significantly greater feelings of trust in rs1042778 TT genotypes compared with G allele carriers. The rs53576 and rs225498 SNPs did not moderate the subjective effects of MDMA in up to 132 subjects. None of the SNPs moderated MDMA-induced impairments in negative facial emotion recognition or enhancements in emotional empathy in the Multifaceted Empathy Test in 69 subjects. MDMA significantly increased plasma oxytocin concentrations. MDMA and oxytocin concentrations did not differ between OXTR gene variants. The present results provide preliminary evidence that OXTR gene variations may modulate aspects of the prosocial subjective effects of MDMA in humans.

941,"Psilocybin’s effects on cognition and creativity: A scoping review.^
Background: Research on psilocybin has become increasingly popular during the current psychedelic renaissance, which began in the early 1990s. Psilocybin’s effects on mental health are promising and there are ongoing efforts to investigate its clinical implementation and its effects on cognition. Aims: The purpose of this study is to report trends in publications, methods, and findings from research examining the effects of psilocybin on cognition and creativity in adults. Methods: We conducted an Open Science Framework preregistered scoping review, guided by the JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis, on literature pertaining to psilocybin’s effects on cognition and creativity. Results/outcomes: In the 42 included studies, psilocybin was primarily administered orally (83%) in a bodyweight-adjusted manner (74%) to healthy participants (90%). Of the few studies that explicitly reported safety outcomes (26%), only one reported serious adverse reactions. During the acute phase post-intake (i.e., minutes to hours), macrodoses tended to impair cognitive performance and creativity, whereas microdoses tended toward creative enhancement. The few macrodosing studies that included post-acute measures (i.e., 1–85 days) reported primarily null but some positive effects.

Your task is to generate an HTML version of an input text, marking up specific entities. The entities to be identified are: Application area, Dosage. Use HTML <span> tags to highlight these entities. Each <span> should have a class attribute indicating the type of entity.

###Entity Markup Guide
Use <span class=""application-area""> to denote Application area, <span class=""dosage""> to denote Dosage.

###Entity Defintions
Application area is defined as: The condition or disease of interest studied under the impact of the psychedelic substance in the present paper.

Dosage is defined as: The applied dosage(s) of the psychedelic substance(s) in the present study.

###Annotation Guidelines
Application area should be annotated according to the following criteria:
* Our working definition for the Application is any ""state labeled as diseases by virtue of consensus on prevalent sociocultural and medical values"". It has to have ""clearly identifiable diagnostic features and disease progression, and response to specific treatment.""
* As a general guideline, annotated entities should be conditions that have an ICD-10/11 code.
* Annotate only in title and/or the introductory part of the abstract, i.e., when the problem or objective of the study is discussed (including abbreviations). Do NOT annotate outcomes, such as ""the Hamilton Depression Scale"" should not be annotated. Similarly, ""antisuicidal response"" should not be annotated. Or: ""among participants, depression was reduced"", do NOT annotate depression.
* Do NOT annotate antidepressant.
* Do not annotate over brackets: ""…or bipolar disorder (BD) type 1 and type 2"", only bipolar disorder and BD should be annotated as two entities.
* Do NOT annotate very generic concepts like ""psychiatric condition""
* Annotate sweeping statements like ""…with major depressive and bipolar disorder"" as one entity.
* Annotate the reasonably necessary string, e.g., ""active suicidal ideation"", active suicidal ideation should be annotated. However, adjectives could be annotated, ""Depressed patients"", annotate Depressed but not patients. ""depressive symptoms"" should both be annotated (also symptoms of depression). In ""refractory anxiety disorder"", annotate the entire string.
* Further defining characteristics should be included: Acute/Chronic; Active/Inactive; Mild/Moderate/Severe; End Stage/Early Stage; Drug-resistant; Total/Partial; Intermittent/Relapsing and others. Similarly, ""Post-stroke"" should be annotated instead of only ""stroke"" because it refers to the phase after the acute stroke.
* Annotate abbreviations. Abbreviations should be annotated  separately. For instance,""Huntington disease (HD)""should be separated into two annotations: ""Huntington disease"" and ""HD.
* Of note, in ""Managing dissociative symptoms following esketamine"", dissociative symptoms are NOT the treatment target but the target of the study and should NOT be annotated (context is relevant).
* Cigarette addiction is a disorder but not smoking cessation.
* Can be empty, i.e., no annotation per abstract.
* Include .^ in the title for highlighting

Dosage should be annotated according to the following criteria:
* Only annotate for studies testing not more than 1 psychedelic substance (e.g., do not annotate in a study testing lsd and psilocybin, BUT annotate in a study testing psilocybin against midazolam)
* Do NOT annotate doses of other substances or of the psychedelic substance in other studies (e.g, mentioned by referencing other studies)
* Do not annotate concentrations of solutions but dosages, i.e., do NOT annotate 500mg/10 ml, but annotate 2mg/kg.
* Annotate the number and the corresponding unit.
* Annotate all reported doses for the respective psychedelic substance.
* Annotate only for single substance studies (i.e., do not annotate in abstracts which report the dosage of two or more psychedelic substances).
* Annotate the number including the unit.
* Annotate also the term ""between"" if pertinent, similarly ""or"" and ""and"" should be annotated. Do not annotate ""per device"".
* Annotate also relative dosages (e.g., 1 mg/kg), do not annotate the terms ""bw"" or ""body weight"" or similar if pertinent
* Do NOT annotate doses measured in e.g., plasma (like 4 mg/ml)
* Can be empty, i.e, no annotation per abstract.

INPUT: Psilocybin’s effects on cognition and creativity: A scoping review.^
Background: Research on psilocybin has become increasingly popular during the current psychedelic renaissance, which began in the early 1990s. Psilocybin’s effects on mental health are promising and there are ongoing efforts to investigate its clinical implementation and its effects on cognition. Aims: The purpose of this study is to report trends in publications, methods, and findings from research examining the effects of psilocybin on cognition and creativity in adults. Methods: We conducted an Open Science Framework preregistered scoping review, guided by the JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis, on literature pertaining to psilocybin’s effects on cognition and creativity. Results/outcomes: In the 42 included studies, psilocybin was primarily administered orally (83%) in a bodyweight-adjusted manner (74%) to healthy participants (90%). Of the few studies that explicitly reported safety outcomes (26%), only one reported serious adverse reactions. During the acute phase post-intake (i.e., minutes to hours), macrodoses tended to impair cognitive performance and creativity, whereas microdoses tended toward creative enhancement. The few macrodosing studies that included post-acute measures (i.e., 1–85 days) reported primarily null but some positive effects. Conclusions/interpretation: This scoping review identified a time-based variation of psilocybin macrodosing effects on cognition and creativity, in which impairment may be observed early post-intake but withdraw over time, and some positive effects may emerge afterward. These findings are limited by methodological concerns and inadequate assessment of long-term effects. We therefore recommend that future psilocybin research be conducted according to existing guidelines and include well-validated measures of cognition and creativity at multiple timepoints.

8030,"Prevalence and associations of challenging, difficult or distressing experiences using classic psychedelics.^
Previous studies have investigated challenging, difficult, or distressing classic psychedelic experiences, but little is known about the prevalence and associations of such experiences. Using nationally representative data of the US adult population (N = 2822), this study examined the prevalence and associations of challenging, difficult, or distressing experiences using classic psychedelics, in a subsample of respondents who reported lifetime classic psychedelic use (n = 613). Of the 613 respondents who reported lifetime classic psychedelic use, the majority of them (59.1 %) had never had a challenging, difficult, or distressing experience using a classic psychedelic, but 8.9 % of respondents reported functional impairment that lasted longer than one day as a result of such experiences. Notably, 2.6 % reported seeking medical, psychiatric, or psychological assistance in the days or weeks following their most challenging, difficult, or distressing classic psychedelic experience. In covariate-adjusted regression models, co-use of lithium, co-use of other mood stabilizers, and six set and setting variables (no preparation, disagreeable physical environment, negative mindset, no psychological support, dose was too large, major life event prior to experience) were associated with the degree of difficulty; and co-use of lithium, co-use of other mood stabilizers, and three set and setting variables (negative mindset, no psychological support, major life event prior to experience) were associated with overall risk of harm. In summary, this study provides insight into the prevalence and associations of challenging, difficult, or distressing classic psychedelic experiences.

8987,"Effects of a single subanaesthetic dose of ketamine on pain and mood after laparoscopic bariatric surgery A randomised double-blind placebo controlled study.^
BACKGROUND When administered as a continuous infusion, ketamine is known to be a potent analgesic and general anaesthetic. Recent studies suggest that a single low‐dose administration of ketamine can provide a long‐lasting effect on mood, but its effects when given in the postoperative period have not been studied. OBJECTIVE We hypothesised that a single low‐dose administration of ketamine after bariatric surgery can improve pain and mood scores in the immediate postoperative period. DESIGN We performed a randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study to compare a single subanaesthetic dose of ketamine (0.4 mg kg‐1) with a normal saline placebo in the postanaesthesia care unit after laparoscopic gastric bypass and gastrectomy. SETTING Single‐centre, tertiary care hospital, October 2014 to January 2018. PATIENTS A total of 100 patients were randomised into the ketamine and saline groups. INTERVENTION Patients in the ketamine group received a single dose of ketamine infusion (0.4 mg kg‐1) in the postanaesthesia care unit. Patients in the placebo groups received 0.9% saline. OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was the visual analogue pain score. A secondary outcome was performance on the short‐form McGill’s Pain Questionnaire (SF‐MPQ). RESULTS There were no significant differences in visual analogue pain scores between groups (group‐by‐time interaction P ¼ 0.966; marginal group effect P ¼ 0.137). However, scores on the affective scale of SF‐MPQ (secondary outcome) significantly decreased in the ketamine group as early as postoperative day (POD) 2 [mean difference ¼ ‐2.2 (95% bootstrap CI ‐2.9 to 1.6), Bonferroni adjusted P < 0.001], compared with placebo group in which the scores decreased only by POD 7. Scores on the total scale of SF‐MPQ for the ketamine group were smaller compared with the placebo group (P ¼ 0.034). CONCLUSION Although there was no significant difference between ketamine and placebo for the primary outcome measure, patients who received ketamine experienced statistically and clinically significant improvement in their comprehensive evaluation of pain, particularly the affective component of pain, on POD 2. However, future studies are needed to confirm the enduring effects of ketamine on the affective response to postoperative pain.","###Task

INPUT: Psilocybin in Adults With and Without Autism Spectrum Disorder.^
To do this, the brain response to two single acute doses of partial serotonin (5HT)1A/2A receptor agonist psilocybin (COMP360) relative to a single dose of placebo (baseline serotonin activity) will be compared in healthy autistic and non‐autistic adults. Brain function will be assessed using a range of MRI (fMRI and MRS), EEG and sensory tasks. Unimodal and multimodal analyses will be conducted. Please note that this study uses psilocybin as a probe of the serotonin system in a Case‐Control science study and, following Scope protocol review, the U.K. MHRA confirmed that it is not a 'Clinical Trial of an Investigational Medicinal Product' (IMP) as defined by the EU Directive 2001/20/EC.

3909,"The Impact of Psilocybin on Patients Experiencing Psychiatric Symptoms: A Systematic Review of Randomized Clinical Trials.^
OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to evaluate the impact of psilocybin on patients experiencing psychiatric symptoms, with a focus on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and safety. METHOD OF RESEARCH: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched the PubMed database and identified studies published from January 2011 to December 2021 pertaining to the impact of psilocybin on psychiatric symptoms. Two authors independently conducted a focused analysis and reached a final consensus on five studies meeting the specific selection criteria. Study bias was addressed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS: The impact of psilocybin on psychiatric symptoms was examined in five randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Four studies administered 1 to 2 doses of psilocybin, with doses ranging from 14mg/70kg to 30mg/70kg, and one study administered a fixed dose of 25mg to all participants. Administration of psilocybin resulted in significant and sustained reduction in symptoms of anxiety and depression, enhanced sense of wellbeing, life satisfaction, and positive mood immediately after psilocybin administration and up to six months after conclusion of treatment. All studies included some form of psychotherapy, and none reported serious adverse effects. CONCLUSION: RCTs show the efficacy of psilocybin in the treatment of anxiety and depression symptoms, as well as improvement in HRQoL, and no serious side effects. However, additional research is necessary to characterize predictors of treatment response, patient screening requirements, effectiveness in broader clinical populations, and guidelines for psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy.","###Task

Your task is to generate an HTML version of an input text, marking up specific entities. The entities to be identified are: Application area, Dosage. Use HTML <span> tags to highlight these entities. Each <span> should have a class attribute indicating the type of entity.

###Entity Markup Guide
Use <span class=""application-area""> to denote Application area, <span class=""dosage""> to denote Dosage.

###Entity Defintions
Application area is defined as: The condition or disease of interest studied under the impact of the psychedelic substance in the present paper.

Dosage is defined as: The applied dosage(s) of the psychedelic substance(s) in the present study.

###Annotation Guidelines
Application area should be annotated according to the following criteria:
* Our working definition for the Application is any ""state labeled as diseases by virtue of consensus on prevalent sociocultural and medical values"". It has to have ""clearly identifiable diagnostic features and disease progression, and response to specific treatment.""
* As a general guideline, annotated entities should be conditions that have an ICD-10/11 code.
* Annotate only in title and/or the introductory part of the abstract, i.e., when the problem or objective of the study is discussed (including abbreviations). Do NOT annotate outcomes, such as ""the Hamilton Depression Scale"" should not be annotated. Similarly, ""antisuicidal response"" should not be annotated. Or: ""among participants, depression was reduced"", do NOT annotate depression.
* Do NOT annotate antidepressant.
* Do not annotate over brackets: ""…or bipolar disorder (BD) type 1 and type 2"", only bipolar disorder and BD should be annotated as two entities.
* Do NOT annotate very generic concepts like ""psychiatric condition""
* Annotate sweeping statements like ""…with major depressive and bipolar disorder"" as one entity.
* Annotate the reasonably necessary string, e.g., ""active suicidal ideation"", active suicidal ideation should be annotated. However, adjectives could be annotated, ""Depressed patients"", annotate Depressed but not patients. ""depressive symptoms"" should both be annotated (also symptoms of depression). In ""refractory anxiety disorder"", annotate the entire string.
* Further defining characteristics should be included: Acute/Chronic; Active/Inactive; Mild/Moderate/Severe; End Stage/Early Stage; Drug-resistant; Total/Partial; Intermittent/Relapsing and others. Similarly, ""Post-stroke"" should be annotated instead of only ""stroke"" because it refers to the phase after the acute stroke.
* Annotate abbreviations. Abbreviations should be annotated  separately. For instance,""Huntington disease (HD)""should be separated into two annotations: ""Huntington disease"" and ""HD.
* Of note, in ""Managing dissociative symptoms following esketamine"", dissociative symptoms are NOT the treatment target but the target of the study and should NOT be annotated (context is relevant).
* Cigarette addiction is a disorder but not smoking cessation.
* Can be empty, i.e., no annotation per abstract.
* Include .^ in the title for highlighting

Dosage should be annotated according to the following criteria:
* Only annotate for studies testing not more than 1 psychedelic substance (e.g., do not annotate in a study testing lsd and psilocybin, BUT annotate in a study testing psilocybin against midazolam)
* Do NOT annotate doses of other substances or of the psychedelic substance in other studies (e.g, mentioned by referencing other studies)
* Do not annotate concentrations of solutions but dosages, i.e., do NOT annotate 500mg/10 ml, but annotate 2mg/kg.
* Annotate the number and the corresponding unit.
* Annotate all reported doses for the respective psychedelic substance.
* Annotate only for single substance studies (i.e., do not annotate in abstracts which report the dosage of two or more psychedelic substances).
* Annotate the number including the unit.
* Annotate also the term ""between"" if pertinent, similarly ""or"" and ""and"" should be annotated. Do not annotate ""per device"".
* Annotate also relative dosages (e.g., 1 mg/kg), do not annotate the terms ""bw"" or ""body weight"" or similar if pertinent

OBJECTIVE: This paper focuses on the outcomes at one-year post-treatment of a naturalistic evaluation of services provided through the Takiwasi Centre, an accredited Peruvian therapeutic community offering an ayahuasca-assisted, integrative treatment program for addiction rehabilitation. METHODS: Participants (n=52) completed structured interviews and a battery of validated instruments. Outcome measures included the Addiction Severity Index (V. 5), the Beck Anxiety and Depression Inventories, the WHOQOL-BREF and the WHOQOL-SRPB. Likert rating scales were used to assess perceived importance and significance of different aspects of the program and overall participant satisfaction. RESULTS: The group change from baseline to the one-year follow up was significant and in the anticipated direction for alcohol and drug use severity, depression and anxiety, and some dimensions of quality of life. There was considerable individual variation in outcomes and treatment duration. The majority of participants rated all aspects of the program as important, including the spiritual and therapeutic significance of the ayahuasca experience which was rated as very significant. CONCLUSION: Based on the positive one-year outcomes, and within the limitations of an uncontrolled observational study design, the findings suggest promise for the effectiveness of the use of ayahuasca in a multifactorial treatment context for individuals with significant treatment histories, high levels of comorbidity and treatment motivation.

BACKGROUND: Ketamine has emerged as a rapid-acting antidepressant in treatment-resistant depression (TRD) increasingly used in non-research, clinical settings. Few studies, however, have examined neurocognitive effects of repeated racemic ketamine infusion treatments in patients with TRD. In an effort to identify potential effects after serial infusions, we conducted a retrospective chart review to identify statistically significant changes in cognition in patient undergoing serial intravenous infusions; concomitantly, we examined baseline cognition as potential predictor of anti-depressant potential. METHODS: Twenty-two patients with TRD were examined after they finished the induction phase of 8-10 repeated intravenous ketamine infusions and completed the assessments of their depressive symptoms (measured by the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report Scale: QIDS-SR16) and cognitive function (measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment: MoCA) before the first and the last ketamine treatments. RESULTS: Repeated ketamine infusions administered through an escalating dose protocol with 8-10 infusion sessions produced a 47.2% reduction response in depression; there was no evidence of impairment as reflected in MoCA testing. There was a moderate association between baseline cognition and antidepressant response with a Pearson correlation of 0.453. CONCLUSION: In this naturalistic sample of patients with TRD in our clinical service, repeated ketamine infusions significantly decreased depression symptoms without impairing cognitive performance.

METHODS: Twenty-two patients with <span class=""application-area"">TRD</span> were examined after they finished the induction phase of <span class=""dosage"">8-10</span> repeated intravenous ketamine infusions and completed the assessments of their depressive symptoms (measured by the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report Scale: QIDS-SR16) and cognitive function (measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment: MoCA) before the first and the last ketamine treatments. RESULTS: Repeated ketamine infusions administered through an escalating dose protocol with <span class=""dosage"">8-10</span> infusion sessions produced a 47.2% reduction response in <span class=""application-area"">depression</span>; there was no evidence of impairment as reflected in MoCA testing. There was a moderate association between baseline cognition and antidepressant response with a Pearson correlation of 0.453. CONCLUSION: In this naturalistic sample of patients with <span class=""application-area"">TRD</span> in our clinical service, repeated ketamine infusions significantly decreased <span class=""application-area"">depression</span> symptoms without impairing cognitive performance. The baseline cognition may positively predict antidepressant responses of repeated ketamine treatment.</p>

7903,"Ketamine amplifies induced gamma frequency oscillations in the human cerebral cortex.^
At subanaesthetic doses, ketamine, an N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, has demonstrated remarkable and rapid antidepressant efficacy in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The mechanism of action of ketamine is complex and not fully understood, with altered glutamatergic function and alterations of high-frequency oscillatory power (Wood et al., 2012) noted in animal studies. Here we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) in a single blind, crossover study to assess the neuronal effects of 0.5 mg/kg intravenous ketamine on task-related high-frequency oscillatory activity in visual and motor cortices. Consistent with animal findings, ketamine increased beta amplitudes, decreased peak gamma frequency in visual cortex and significantly amplified gamma-band amplitudes in motor and visual cortices. The amplification of gamma-band activity has previously been linked in animal studies to cortical pyramidal cell disinhibition. This study provides direct translatable evidence of this hypothesis in humans, which may underlie the anti-depressant actions of ketamine.

8156,"Four weekly ayahuasca sessions lead to increases in ""acceptance"" capacities: A comparison study with a standard 8-week mindfulness training program.^
Background: The therapeutic effects of the Amazonian plant tea ayahuasca may relate to its ability to enhance mindfulness capacities. Ayahuasca induces a modified state of awareness through the combined action of its active principles: the psychedelic N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and a series of centrally acting ß-carbolines, mainly harmine and tetrahydroharmine. To better understand the therapeutic potential of ayahuasca, here we compared the impact on mindfulness capacities induced by two independent interventions: (a) participation in four ayahuasca sessions without any specific purpose related to improving mindfulness capacities; and (b) participation in a standard mindfulness training course: 8 weeks mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), with the specific goal of improving these skills. Methods: Participants of two independent groups completed two self-report instruments: The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) and the Experiences Questionnaire (EQ). The MINDSENS Composite Index was also calculated, including those EQ and FFMQ items that have proven to be the most sensitive to meditation practice. Group A (n = 10) was assessed before and after the last of four closely spaced consecutive ayahuasca sessions. Group B (n = 10) was assessed before and after completion of a standard 8-week MBSR course. Results: MBSR training led to greater increases in overall mindfulness scores after the 8-week period. MBSR but not ayahuasca led to increases in the MINDSENS Composite Index. However, the ayahuasca sessions induced comparable increases in the Non-Judging subscale of the FFMQ, specifically measuring ""acceptance."" Improving this capacity allows for a more detached and less judgmental stance toward potentially distressing thoughts and emotions. Conclusion: The present findings suggest that a small number of ayahuasca sessions can be as effective at improving acceptance as more lengthy and costly interventions. Future studies should address the benefits of combining ayahuasca administration with mindfulness-based interventions.

3638,"Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Lysergic Acid Diethylamide Microdoses in Healthy Participants.^
""Microdoses"" of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) are used recreationally to enhance mood and cognition. Increasing interest has also been seen in developing LSD into a medication. Therefore, we performed a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic study using very low doses of LSD. Single doses of LSD base (5, 10, and 20 µg) and placebo were administered in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study in 23 healthy participants. Test days were separated by at least 5 days. Plasma levels of LSD and subjective effects were assessed up to 6 hours after administration. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using compartmental modeling. Concentration-subjective effect relationships were described using pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling. Mean (95% confidence interval) maximal LSD concentrations were 151 pg/mL (127-181), 279 pg/mL (243-320), and 500 pg/mL (413-607) after 5, 10, and 20 µg LSD administration, respectively. Maximal concentrations were reached after 1.1 hours. The mean elimination half-life was 2.7 hours (1.5-6.2). The 5 µg dose of LSD elicited no significant acute subjective effects. The 10 µg dose of LSD significantly increased ratings of ""under the influence"" and ""good drug effect"" compared with placebo. These effects began an average of 1.1 hours after 10 µg LSD administration, peaked at 2.5 hours, and ended at 5.1 hours. The 20 µg dose of LSD significantly increased ratings of ""under the influence,"" ""good drug effects,"" and ""bad drug effects."" LSD concentrations dose-proportionally increased at doses as low as 5-20 µg and decreased with a half-life of 3 hours. The threshold dose of LSD base for psychotropic effects was 10 µg.","###Task

INPUT: Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Lysergic Acid Diethylamide Microdoses in Healthy Participants.^
""Microdoses"" of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) are used recreationally to enhance mood and cognition. Increasing interest has also been seen in developing LSD into a medication. Therefore, we performed a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic study using very low doses of LSD. Single doses of LSD base (5, 10, and 20 µg) and placebo were administered in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study in 23 healthy participants. Test days were separated by at least 5 days. Plasma levels of LSD and subjective effects were assessed up to 6 hours after administration. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using compartmental modeling. Concentration-subjective effect relationships were described using pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling. Mean (95% confidence interval) maximal LSD concentrations were 151 pg/mL (127-181), 279 pg/mL (243-320), and 500 pg/mL (413-607) after 5, 10, and 20 µg LSD administration, respectively. Maximal concentrations were reached after 1.1 hours. The mean elimination half-life was 2.7 hours (1.5-6.2). The 5 µg dose of LSD elicited no significant acute subjective effects. The 10 µg dose of LSD significantly increased ratings of ""under the influence"" and ""good drug effect"" compared with placebo. These effects began an average of 1.1 hours after 10 µg LSD administration, peaked at 2.5 hours, and ended at 5.1 hours. The 20 µg dose of LSD significantly increased ratings of ""under the influence,"" ""good drug effects,"" and ""bad drug effects."" LSD concentrations dose-proportionally increased at doses as low as 5-20 µg and decreased with a half-life of 3 hours. The threshold dose of LSD base for psychotropic effects was 10 µg.

2490,"Real-world effectiveness of repeated ketamine infusions for treatment-resistant bipolar depression.^
BACKGROUND: Clinical trials have demonstrated rapid antidepressant effects with intravenous (IV) ketamine for major depressive disorder, with relatively less research specifically for bipolar depression. Herein, we describe the real-world effectiveness of repeated ketamine infusions for treatment-resistant bipolar depression. METHODS: This study was conducted in a community clinic in Mississauga, Ontario (Canadian Rapid Treatment Centre of Excellence; Braxia Health). In this observational study (NCT04209296), patients with treatment-resistant bipolar I/II depression (n = 66) received four sub-anesthetic doses of IV ketamine (0.5-0.75 mg/kg) over a two-week period. Symptoms of depression, suicidality, anxiety, and functioning were assessed with validated self-report measures. RESULTS: Statistically and clinically significant antidepressant effects were observed in the overall sample, as measured by the Quick Inventory for Depression Symptomatology-Self Report-16 (QIDS-SR(16) ) with further reductions in depressive symptoms observed after each subsequent infusion (n = 66; mean QIDS-SR(16) reduction of 6.08+/-1.39; p < 0.0001). Significant reductions of suicidal thoughts (QIDS-SR(16) -Suicide Item) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) were also observed with functional improvements on the Sheehan Disability Scale (p < 0.0001 on all measures). Moreover, the response rate (QIDS-SR(16) total score decrease ≥50% from baseline) was 35% and remission rate (QIDS-SR(16) total score ≤5) was 20% after four infusions. Infusions were generally well tolerated with treatment-emergent hypomania observed in only three patients (4.5%) with zero cases of mania or psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: Real-world effectiveness of IV ketamine for bipolar depression was observed. Repeated doses were associated with greater symptom reduction and adequate tolerability.","###Task

7190,"Attenuation of ketamine-induced impairment in verbal learning and memory in healthy volunteers by the AMPA receptor potentiator PF-04958242.^
There is a need to develop treatments for cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia (CIAS). The significant role played by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in both the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and in neuronal plasticity suggests that facilitation of NMDAR function might ameliorate CIAS. One strategy to correct NMDAR hypofunction is to stimulate α-amino-3- hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) as AMPAR and NMDAR functioning are coupled and interdependent. In rats and nonhuman primates (NHP), AMPAR potentiators reduce spatial working memory deficits caused by the nonselective NMDAR antagonist ketamine. The current study assessed whether the AMPAR potentiator PF-04958242 would attenuate ketamine-induced deficits in verbal learning and memory in humans. Healthy male subjects (n = 29) participated in two randomized treatment periods of daily placebo or PF-04958242 for 5 days separated by a washout period. On day 5 of each treatment period, subjects underwent a ketamine infusion for 75 min during which the effects of PF-04958242/placebo were assessed on ketamine-induced: (1) impairments in verbal learning and recall measured by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test; (2) impairments in working memory on a CogState battery; and (3) psychotomimetic effects measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and Clinician-Administered Dissociative Symptoms Scale. PF-04958242 significantly reduced ketamine-induced impairments in immediate recall and the 2-Back and spatial working memory tasks (CogState Battery), without significantly attenuating ketamine-induced psychotomimetic effects. There were no pharmacokinetic interactions between PF-04958242 and ketamine. Furthermore, PF-04958242 was well tolerated. ‘High-impact’ AMPAR potentiators like PF-04958242 may have a role in the treatment of the cognitive symptoms, but not the positive or negative symptoms, associated with schizophrenia. The excellent concordance between the preclinical (rat, NHP) and human studies with PF-04958242, and in silico modeling of AMPAR–NMDAR interactions in the hippocampus, highlights the translational value of this study.

6869,"Intranasal ketamine for acute cluster headache attacks-Results from a proof-of-concept open-label trial.^
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the safety and efficacy of intranasal ketamine for the treatment of a single cluster headache (CH) attack. BACKGROUND: Acute treatment options for patients with CH who have an insufficient response to oxygen and triptans are limited. Intranasal ketamine has anecdotally been successful in treating a CH attack. METHODS: We conducted an open-label pilot study enrolling 23 patients with chronic CH (International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition), and of these, 20 patients treated a single CH attack with intranasal ketamine. Under in-hospital observation, patients received 15 mg of intranasal ketamine every 6 min a maximum of five times. The primary endpoint was a 50% reduction in pain intensity within 15 min after initiating treatment. RESULTS: The primary endpoint was not met; 15 min after the first ketamine administration, the mean reduction in pain intensity was 1.1 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.6 to 2.7, p = 0.188) on the numeric rating scale (NRS), equivalent to a 15% reduction in pain intensity. However, 30 min after the first application, the pain intensity was reduced by 59% on an 11-point NRS (mean difference: 4.3, 95% CI: 2.4-6.2, p < 0.001, N = 16) and 11 out of 16 (69%) scored 4 or below on the NRS. Four patients received rescue medication 15 min after the first ketamine application and were therefore excluded from the analysis at 30 min. Half of the patients preferred ketamine to oxygen and/or sumatriptan injection. No serious adverse events were identified during the trial. CONCLUSION: Intranasal ketamine may be an effective acute treatment for CH at 30 min but should be tested in a larger controlled design. Patients and physicians should be conscious of the abuse potential of ketamine.","###Task

2207,"Long term structural and functional neural changes following a single infusion of Ketamine in PTSD.^
NMDA receptor antagonists have a vital role in extinction, learning, and reconsolidation processes. During the reconsolidation window, memories are activated into a labile state and can be reconsolidated in an altered form. This concept might have significant clinical implications in treating PTSD. In this pilot study we tested the potential of a single infusion of ketamine, followed by brief exposure therapy, to enhance post-retrieval extinction of PTSD trauma memories. 27 individuals diagnosed with PTSD were randomly assigned to receive either ketamine (0.5 mg/kg 40 min; N = 14) or midazolam (0.045 mg/kg; N = 13) after retrieval of the traumatic memory. 24 h following infusion, participants received a four-day trauma-focused psychotherapy. Symptoms and brain activity were assessed before treatment, at the end of treatment, and at 30-day follow-up. Amygdala activation to trauma scripts (a major biomarker of fear response) served as the main study outcome. Although PTSD symptoms improved equally in both groups, post-treatment, ketamine recipients showed a lower amygdala (-0.33, sd = 0.13, 95%HDI [-0.56,-0.04]) and hippocampus (-0.3 (sd = 0.19), 95%HDI [-0.65, 0.04]; marginal effect) reactivation to trauma memories, compared to midazolam recipients. Post-retrieval ketamine administration was also associated with decreased connectivity between the amygdala and hippocampus (-0.28, sd = 0.11, 95%HDI [-0.46, -0.11]), with no change in amygdala-vmPFC connectivity. Moreover, reduction in fractional anisotropy in bi-lateral uncinate fasciculus was seen in the Ketamine recipients compared with the midazolam recipients (right: post-treatment: -0.01108, 95% HDI [-0.0184,-0.003]; follow-up: -0.0183, 95% HDI [-0.02719,-0.0107]; left: post-treatment: -0.019, 95% HDI [-0.028,-0.011]; follow-up: -0.017, 95% HDI [-0.026,-0.007]). Taken together it is possible that ketamine may enhance post-retrieval extinction of the original trauma memories in humans. These preliminary findings show promising direction toward the capacity to rewrite human traumatic memories and modulate the fear response for at least 30 days post-extinction. When combined with psychotherapy for PTSD, further investigation of ketamine dose, timing of administration, and frequency of administration, is warranted.","###Task

In this pilot study we tested the potential of a single infusion of ketamine, followed by brief exposure therapy, to enhance post-retrieval extinction of <span class=""application-area"">PTSD</span> trauma memories. 27 individuals diagnosed with <span class=""application-area"">PTSD</span> were randomly assigned to receive either ketamine (<span class=""dosage"">0.5 mg/kg</span> 40 min; N = 14) or midazolam (<span class=""dosage"">0.045 mg/kg</span>; N = 13) after retrieval of the traumatic memory. 24 h following infusion, participants received a four-day trauma-focused psychotherapy. Symptoms and brain activity were assessed before treatment, at the end of treatment, and at 30-day follow-up. Amygdala activation to trauma scripts (a major biomarker of fear response) served as the main study outcome. Although <span class=""application-area"">PTSD</span> symptoms improved equally in both groups, post-treatment, ketamine recipients showed a lower amygdala (-0.33, sd = 0.13, 95%HDI [-0.56,-0.04]) and hippocampus (-0.3 (sd = 0.19), 95%HDI [-0.65, 0.04]; marginal effect) reactivation to trauma memories, compared to midazolam recipients. Post-retrieval ketamine administration was also associated with decreased connectivity between the amygdala and hippocampus (-0.28, sd = 0.11, 95%HDI [-0.46, -0.11]), with no change in amygdala-vmPFC connectivity. Moreover, reduction in fractional anisotropy in bi-lateral uncinate fasciculus was seen in the Ketamine recipients compared with the midazolam recipients (right: post-treatment: -0.01108, 95% HDI [-0.0184,-0.003]; follow-up: -0.0183, 95% HDI [-0.02719,-0.0107]; left: post-treatment: -0.019, 95% HDI [-0.028,-0.011]; follow-up: -0.017, 95% HDI [-0.026,-0.007]). Taken together it is possible that ketamine may enhance post-retrieval extinction of the original trauma memories in humans. These preliminary findings show promising direction toward the capacity to rewrite human traumatic memories and modulate the fear response for at least 30 days post-extinction. When combined with psychotherapy for <span class=""application-area"">PTSD</span>, further investigation of ketamine <span class=""dosage"">dose</span>, timing of administration, and frequency of administration, is warranted.</p>

988,"Acute effects of ayahuasca on neuropsychological performance: differences in executive function between experienced and occasional users.^
BACKGROUND: Ayahuasca, a South American psychotropic plant tea containing the psychedelic 5-HT2A receptor agonist N,N-dimethyltryptamine, has been shown to increase regional cerebral blood flow in prefrontal brain regions after acute administration to humans. Despite interactions at this level, neuropsychological studies have not found cognitive deficits in abstinent long-term users. OBJECTIVES: Here, we wished to investigate the effects of acute ayahuasca intake on neuropsychological performance, specifically on working memory and executive function. METHODS: Twenty-four ayahuasca users (11 long-term experienced users and 13 occasional users) were assessed in their habitual setting using the Stroop, Sternberg, and Tower of London tasks prior to and following ayahuasca intake. RESULTS: Errors in the Sternberg task increased, whereas reaction times in the Stroop task decreased and accuracy was maintained for the whole sample following ayahuasca intake. Interestingly, results in the Tower of London showed significantly increased execution and resolution times and number of movements for the occasional but not the experienced users. Additionally, a correlation analysis including all subjects showed that impaired performance in the Tower of London was inversely correlated with lifetime ayahuasca use. CONCLUSIONS: Acute ayahuasca administration impaired working memory but decreased stimulus-response interference. Interestingly, detrimental effects on higher cognition were only observed in the less experienced group. Rather than leading to increased impairment, greater prior exposure to ayahuasca was associated with reduced incapacitation. Compensatory or neuromodulatory effects associated with long-term ayahuasca intake could underlie preserved executive function in experienced users.","###Task

7050,"Lsd increases social adaptation to opinions similar to one's own.^
Background: Inferring value from the reactions of others and adapting one's behavior to a social group norm is an essential process in every‐day decision making. However, the neuropharmacology of social influence processing is mostly unknown, although lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), acting at multiple 5‐HT2 receptors, has recently been shown to alter social perception. Methods: The role of the 5‐HT2A receptor on social influence on aesthetic judgements was investigated by assessing social feedback processing and subsequent decision making in 23 healthy participants via fMRI and behavioral ratings. Participants received 1) placebo+placebo, 2) placebo+LSD (100 mg po), or 3) ketanserin ‐ a selective 5‐HT2A receptor antagonist (40 mg po)+LSD in three different sessions. Results: Participants adapted their opinion more strongly to the group norm in the high conflict (HC) condition than the low conflict (LC) condition under placebo and ketanserin+LSD. This pattern was reversed by LSD (all p<0.05, Bonferroni corrected). Processing LC was associated with increased BOLD signal in the dorsal striatum in the LSD condition, while processing HC was associated with increased BOLD signal in the supplementary motor area in the placebo condition. No differences in BOLD signal were observed during decision making. Conclusions: LSD increases adaptation to opinions similar to one's own, presumably via stimulation of 5‐HT2A receptors.

595,"A case of prolonged mania, psychosis, and severe depression after psilocybin use: Implications of increased psychedelic drug availability.^
The article presents a case of a 32-year-old woman who presented for continuation of treatment in May 2021 with a chief complaint of 'cognitive dysfunction and severe reduced functionality.' Eight months before her first appointment with one of the authors, the patient was in her usual state of health. She had a history of mild depression and generalized anxiety disorder, successfully treated with venlafaxine prescribed by her psychiatrist. At this time, her sleep, appetite, concentration, and range of mood were normal. She was employed as a senior associate at a high-level accounting firm and had graduated from a prestigious graduate school, both competitive environments in which she excelled. In the fall of 2020, at the urging of friends, the patient decided to ingest psilocybin mushrooms. She was still consistently taking venlafaxine at the time of ingestion. Hours after the second ingestion, she developed paranoid delusions, which persisted for months. After 2 months, during which she titrated up to the relatively high dosage of 4.5 mg/day of pramipexole, she reported a significant shift in her functioning. She started to feel emotions again, and began to performbasic errands and self-care. Using the experience of the patient presented in this case—a patient who experienced a profound negative reaction after recreational ingestion of psilocybin mushrooms—to understand some of the risks associated with psychedelic use, authors discuss several challenging issues that are emerging as psychedelics receive more media attention and become more available. Authors explore differences between clinical and nonclinical psychedelic use and their attendant risks and benefits. This case suggests that current policy trends, including efforts to render psychedelics widely available for therapeutic use, will place patients at undue risk. Finally, authors make recommendations for the future of psychedelic research and clinical applications based on the patient’s experience. Details of the case have been modified to protect the patient’s identity, and the patient has approved publication of the case for educational purposes. Psychiatrists have an ethical obligation to maintain clinical equipoise with regard to new treatments while they are still in the investigational stage. At this point, psychedelics are on track to becoming an evidence-based psychiatric intervention, with positive clinical trials thus far. Optimism about these positive results is warranted, but psychiatrists should be aware that only a few hundred patients have actually received psilocybin in clinical research settings—which suggests a field that is still in its infancy—and, in contrast to other randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials, blinding is simply not possible with psilocybin. Psychiatrists should remain open to any outcome of clinical research while the safety and efficacy of psychedelics are still being determined. Right now, a promising psychiatric treatment risks getting swept up in a broader cultural moment—a dynamic that could lead to compromises in quality and reduce the efficacy of psychedelic therapies. Similar cultural forces led to the demise of psychedelic therapies a half century ago. Today we find ourselves in the unprecedented position where the safety and efficacy of medical treatments are being decided by popular opinion—and at the expense of the scientific process. The field of psychiatry should stand for the integrity of the scientific process, and encourage the development and administration of new treatments, including psychedelic therapies, in ways that maximize their safety and efficacy.

INPUT: A case of prolonged mania, psychosis, and severe depression after psilocybin use: Implications of increased psychedelic drug availability.^
The article presents a case of a 32-year-old woman who presented for continuation of treatment in May 2021 with a chief complaint of 'cognitive dysfunction and severe reduced functionality.' Eight months before her first appointment with one of the authors, the patient was in her usual state of health. She had a history of mild depression and generalized anxiety disorder, successfully treated with venlafaxine prescribed by her psychiatrist. At this time, her sleep, appetite, concentration, and range of mood were normal. She was employed as a senior associate at a high-level accounting firm and had graduated from a prestigious graduate school, both competitive environments in which she excelled. In the fall of 2020, at the urging of friends, the patient decided to ingest psilocybin mushrooms. She was still consistently taking venlafaxine at the time of ingestion. Hours after the second ingestion, she developed paranoid delusions, which persisted for months. After 2 months, during which she titrated up to the relatively high dosage of 4.5 mg/day of pramipexole, she reported a significant shift in her functioning. She started to feel emotions again, and began to performbasic errands and self-care. Using the experience of the patient presented in this case—a patient who experienced a profound negative reaction after recreational ingestion of psilocybin mushrooms—to understand some of the risks associated with psychedelic use, authors discuss several challenging issues that are emerging as psychedelics receive more media attention and become more available. Authors explore differences between clinical and nonclinical psychedelic use and their attendant risks and benefits. This case suggests that current policy trends, including efforts to render psychedelics widely available for therapeutic use, will place patients at undue risk. Finally, authors make recommendations for the future of psychedelic research and clinical applications based on the patient’s experience. Details of the case have been modified to protect the patient’s identity, and the patient has approved publication of the case for educational purposes. Psychiatrists have an ethical obligation to maintain clinical equipoise with regard to new treatments while they are still in the investigational stage. At this point, psychedelics are on track to becoming an evidence-based psychiatric intervention, with positive clinical trials thus far. Optimism about these positive results is warranted, but psychiatrists should be aware that only a few hundred patients have actually received psilocybin in clinical research settings—which suggests a field that is still in its infancy—and, in contrast to other randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials, blinding is simply not possible with psilocybin. Psychiatrists should remain open to any outcome of clinical research while the safety and efficacy of psychedelics are still being determined. Right now, a promising psychiatric treatment risks getting swept up in a broader cultural moment—a dynamic that could lead to compromises in quality and reduce the efficacy of psychedelic therapies. Similar cultural forces led to the demise of psychedelic therapies a half century ago. Today we find ourselves in the unprecedented position where the safety and efficacy of medical treatments are being decided by popular opinion—and at the expense of the scientific process. The field of psychiatry should stand for the integrity of the scientific process, and encourage the development and administration of new treatments, including psychedelic therapies, in ways that maximize their safety and efficacy.

7073,"Effects of intravenous ketamine on explicit and implicit suicdal cognition: a randomized controlled trial in treatment-resistant depression.^
Background: Preliminary evidence suggests intravenous (IV) ketamine has rapid effects on suicidal cognition, making it a potentially attractive candidate for depressed patients at imminent risk of suicide. In the first randomized controlled trial of ketamine to use a psychoactive control condition, we tested ketamine's acute effects on explicit suicidal cognition as well as on a performancebased index of implicit suicidal cognition (the Implicit Association Test; IAT) previously linked to suicidal behavior. Methods: Symptomatic patients with treatment‐resistant depression, defined as inadequate response to ≥ 3 antidepressants, were assessed using a composite index of explicit suicidal ideation (Beck Suicide Scale, Montgomery‐Asberg Rating Scale suicide item, Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms‐Self Report suicide item) and the IAT to assess implicit suicidal associations. Measures were taken at baseline and 24‐hours following a single subanesthetic dose of IV ketamine (n=37) or a psychoactive control with no known antidepressant properties (midazolam; n=21). Results: 24‐hours post‐infusion, explicit suicidal cognition was significantly reduced in the ketamine but not the midazolam group (group x time: p=.01). 51% of ketamine‐treated patients scored zero on all three explicit suicide measures at 24‐hours, compared with 24% of the midazolam group (Pearson's chi‐square p=.04). Implicit associations between self‐ and escape‐related words were also reduced following ketamine (p=.002; d=.51) but not midazolam (p=.65; d=.13). Conclusions: Intravenous ketamine produces rapid reductions in suicidal cognition over and above active placebo. Further study is warranted to explore whether ketamine's anti‐suicidal properties extend to higher‐risk samples and suicidal behaviors.","###Task

7960,"Substance use, suicidality, and adolescent-onset schizophrenia: An Israeli 10-year retrospective study.^
Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the link between the use of specific types of substances and suicidality in adolescent inpatients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Methods: We performed a 10-year naturalistic retrospective study of 178 adolescent inpatients diagnosed as suffering from either schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. A comparison was made between the suicide-attempting adolescent inpatients and the non-attempting subjects, by the use of specific types of substances, measurements of psychotic, depressive, and aggressive symptoms, and clinical data reported during their hospitalization. Results: The suicide attempters reported considerably greater usage of inhalants and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Alcohol and methylene-dioxy-methylamphethamine (MDMA) were also used significantly more by this group. However, no differences were found in the usage of cannabis, amphethamines, cocaine, and opiates. The suicide-attempting patients were found to have had more previous psychiatric admissions, a greater level of deliberate self-harm behavior, and a higher level of suicide ideation, but a decreased severity of psychotic symptoms. Conclusions: This study is the first report of the association between specific types of substances and suicidality in the high-risk population of adolescent psychotic inpatients.

2936,"Comparative evaluation of midazolam and ketamine with midazolam alone as oral premedication.^
BACKGROUND: Oral premedication with midazolam and ketamine is widely used in pediatric anesthesia to reduce emotional trauma and ensure smooth induction. However, various dosing regimens when used alone or in combination have variable efficacy and side effect profile. The aim of our study was to investigate and compare the efficacy of oral midazolam alone with a low-dose combination of oral midazolam and ketamine. METHODS: We performed a prospective randomized double-blind study in 100 children who were randomly allocated into two groups. Group M received 0.5 mg.kg(-1) oral midazolam and group MK received 0.25 mg.kg(-1) oral midazolam with 2.5 mg.kg(-1) oral ketamine. The preoperative sedation score, ease of parental separation and ease of mask acceptance were evaluated on a 4-point scale. The time to recovery from anesthesia and to achieve satisfactory Aldrete score was also noted. RESULTS: Uniform and acceptable sedation scores were seen in both the groups (group M 95.9%; group MK 97.96%), without any serious side effects. However, the combination offered significantly more children in an awake, calm and quiet state, who were easily separated from their parents (73.46% in MK vs 41% in group M). The induction scores were comparable between the groups. The recovery room characteristics and time to achieve satisfactory Aldrete score were also comparable between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Oral midazolam alone and a combination of midazolam with ketamine provide equally effective anxiolysis and separation characteristics. However, the combination provided more children in an awake, calm and quiet state who could be separated easily from parents.","###Task

INPUT: Comparative evaluation of midazolam and ketamine with midazolam alone as oral premedication.^
BACKGROUND: Oral premedication with midazolam and ketamine is widely used in pediatric anesthesia to reduce emotional trauma and ensure smooth induction. However, various dosing regimens when used alone or in combination have variable efficacy and side effect profile. The aim of our study was to investigate and compare the efficacy of oral midazolam alone with a low-dose combination of oral midazolam and ketamine. METHODS: We performed a prospective randomized double-blind study in 100 children who were randomly allocated into two groups. Group M received 0.5 mg.kg(-1) oral midazolam and group MK received 0.25 mg.kg(-1) oral midazolam with 2.5 mg.kg(-1) oral ketamine. The preoperative sedation score, ease of parental separation and ease of mask acceptance were evaluated on a 4-point scale. The time to recovery from anesthesia and to achieve satisfactory Aldrete score was also noted. RESULTS: Uniform and acceptable sedation scores were seen in both the groups (group M 95.9%; group MK 97.96%), without any serious side effects. However, the combination offered significantly more children in an awake, calm and quiet state, who were easily separated from their parents (73.46% in MK vs 41% in group M). The induction scores were comparable between the groups. The recovery room characteristics and time to achieve satisfactory Aldrete score were also comparable between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Oral midazolam alone and a combination of midazolam with ketamine provide equally effective anxiolysis and separation characteristics. However, the combination provided more children in an awake, calm and quiet state who could be separated easily from parents.

5641,"A retrospective naturalistic study comparing the efficacy of ketamine and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for treatment-resistant depression.^
Depression is a common mental disorder that affects many people worldwide, while a significant proportion of patients remain non-responsive to antidepressant medications. Alternative treatment options such as ketamine therapy and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) therapy are offered nowadays. This study aims to describe and compare the acute antidepressive efficacy of both, intramuscular ketamine and rTMS in depression patients seeking help in a naturalistic clinical mental health setting. The clinical records of 24 patients with treatment resistant depression were collected from the clinical base of a real life clinic. Twelve patients were treated with intramuscular ketamine, twice weekly for 8 sessions, and twelve patients were treated with 30 sessions of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex—intermittent theta-burst stimulation (DLPFC-iTBS). Using three clinical assessments (HDRS, HAM-A, BDI-II), our data reveal that both therapies led to significant improvement in symptoms from pre- to post-treatment, as well as that the two experimental groups did not differ significantly with respect to pre- to post-depressive and anxiety symptoms, indicating that the effect of both experimental groups in our sample was equally effective. Furthermore, our results showed high remission and response rates in both groups, with no statistical differences between the patients of ketamine group and rTMS group in remission and response rates. We show a significant pre- to post-treatment reduction in depressive and anxiety symptoms, with no significant differences between the two experimental groups, indicating that the effect of both therapies was equally effective in our limited sample.

1650,"Efficacy and safety of adjunctive therapy using esketamine or racemic ketamine for adult treatment-resistant depression: A randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority study.^
BACKGROUND: Ketamine and its enantiomers have recently been highlighted as one of the most effective therapeutic options in refractory depression. However, racemic ketamine and esketamine have not been directly compared. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of esketamine compared to ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). METHODS: This is a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, bicentre, non-inferiority clinical trial, with two parallel groups. Participants were randomly assigned to a 40-min single intravenous infusion of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg or esketamine 0.25 mg/kg. The primary outcome was the difference in remission rates for depression 24 h following intervention using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), with a non-inferiority margin of 20%. RESULTS: 63 subjects were included and randomly assigned (29 to receive ketamine and 34 to receive esketamine). At 24 h, 24.1% of participants in the ketamine group and 29.4% of participants in the esketamine group showed remission, with a difference of 5.3% (95% CILB -13.6%), confirming non-inferiority.

8413,"Baseline neural response during the processing of emotional faces predicts antidepressant response to ketamine.^
Background: Emotional processing biases in major depressive disorder(MDD) may be associated with altered neural processing in visual cortical regions. Ketamine, an NMDA antagonist, produces rapid antidepressant effects. Here we correlated antidepressant response to ketamine with baseline neural response to emotional faces when judging emotion and gender. Methods: Ten unmedicated depressed MDD patients(3 males) participated in an FMRI study. Identical emotional faces were presented under 2 conditions: 1) judge emotion as positive (happy/neutral) or negative (sad/angry) and 2) judge gender. Subjects then participated in a placebo‐controlled, crossover trial with i.v. ketamine(.5mg/kg). Depressive symptoms were assessed repeatedly using the Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Multiple regression estimated BOLD response when judging emotion (positive/ negative) and when judging gender (positive/negative).

INPUT: Baseline neural response during the processing of emotional faces predicts antidepressant response to ketamine.^
Background: Emotional processing biases in major depressive disorder(MDD) may be associated with altered neural processing in visual cortical regions. Ketamine, an NMDA antagonist, produces rapid antidepressant effects. Here we correlated antidepressant response to ketamine with baseline neural response to emotional faces when judging emotion and gender. Methods: Ten unmedicated depressed MDD patients(3 males) participated in an FMRI study. Identical emotional faces were presented under 2 conditions: 1) judge emotion as positive (happy/neutral) or negative (sad/angry) and 2) judge gender. Subjects then participated in a placebo‐controlled, crossover trial with i.v. ketamine(.5mg/kg). Depressive symptoms were assessed repeatedly using the Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Multiple regression estimated BOLD response when judging emotion (positive/ negative) and when judging gender (positive/negative). BOLD response (4 conditions) was correlated with treatment outcome(percent change in MADRS). Significance defined as voxel p<0.005; whole brain corrected. Results: BOLD response correlated positively with treatment response when judging negative emotion bilaterally in middle occipital cortex(MOC) and in left parahippocampal gyrus; and correlated positively when judging positive emotion in an overlapping region of left MOC. When judging gender and emotion was positive, a positive correlation was observed in a more dorsal, non‐overlapping region of left MOC.

Preclinical and clinical evidence has demonstrated that ketamine has rapid antidepressant effects.

The present study therefore compares four different formulations of LSD and placebo: (1) An oral drinking solution of LSD base currently used in many research studies (<span class=""dosage"">100 μg LSD</span> in 96% ethanol), (2) A solid orodispersible film containing LSD base (<span class=""dosage"">100 μg LSD</span>), (3) LSD tartrate used in research and recreationally (<span class=""dosage"">100 μg LSD</span> equivalent of LSD tartrate in water), (4) an intravenous administration of LSD tartrate (<span class=""dosage"">100 μg LSD</span> equivalent of LSD tartrate in water), and (5) placebo for all formulations (quadruple‐dummy). The primary goals are to document the bioequivalence of LSD base (1) and tartrate (3) and to define the oral bioavailability of LSD using an additional intravenous LSD administration.

4428,"Cognitive performance after repeated administration of the NMDA positive allosteric modulator SAGE-718 in healthy volunteers.^
Background: NMDA receptor hypoactivity has been linked to a range of clinical phenomena, including cognitive dysfunction and alterations in social behavior. Potential treatments for conditions characterized by NMDA hypofunction may involve enhancement of NMDA receptor‐related neurotransmission. In a recent suite of target‐engagement studies, SAGE‐718, an investigational positive allosteric modulator of the NMDA receptor, demonstrated effects on electrophysiological and functional imaging biomarkers in healthy volunteers after a low dose ketamine challenge. These findings are consistent with CNS penetrance and functional engagement of the NMDA receptor. Here, the effects of 10‐day repeated exposure of SAGE‐718 on a core cognitive battery were investigated in healthy volunteers. Methods: Forty subjects were randomized (1:1) to either multiple oral doses of SAGE‐718 (n = 19) plus ketamine or placebo (n = 21) plus ketamine, which was delivered in a double‐blinded manner [SAGE‐718: n = 19, mean (SD) age 42.7 (12.00) years, 15.8% female; Placebo: n = 21, mean (SD) age 42.6 (11.56) years, 15.4% female]. SAGE‐718 oral solution or matching placebo solution was administered as a 1.0‐mg dose in a fasted condition once daily (between 7 and 10 AM) over the course of 10 days. Blood samples were taken and processed for pharmacokinetic analysis of concentrations of SAGE‐718. Plasma samples were used to calculate Cmax as well as other PK parameters. Computerized testing was used to measure performance on key cognitive domains, including attention, working memory, processing speed, executive function, and motor reaction time. Assessments included computerized versions of the International Shopping List Test (verbal learning), International Shopping List Test‐Delayed Recall (memory), Groton Maze Learning Test (executive function), Social Emotional Cognition Test (emotional cognition), Detection Test (psychomotor function), Identification Test (attention), One Back Test (working memory), Two Back Test (higher‐order working memory), Stop Signal Reaction Test (inhibition), and the Continuous Paired Associate Learning Test (paired associated learning). A mixed‐effect regression model analysis (MMRM) was applied, with change from baseline in each cognitive test score as the response variable, and treatment, visit, and visit‐by‐treatment interaction as fixed effects, baseline as a covariate, and measurements within the same subject as repeated measure. Unstructured covariance structure was applied for the repeated measure. Safety was assessed by adverse event reporting, standard clinical assessments, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, the Clinician Administered Dissociate State Scale, the Observers Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale, and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Results: As compared to placebo, statistically significant improvements were observed in the Two‐Back Test at days 2, 4 and 8 of testing (p < 0.05). Compared to placebo, statistically significant improvement was observed on the Groton Maze Test at day 6 of testing (p < 0.05). A dose‐response relationship was observed for the Two‐Back Test, with Cmax positively correlated with an increase in change from baseline performance on the Two‐Back Test (p = 0.02). A similar trend was observed for the Groton Maze Test (Cmax vs change from baseline, p = 0.06). SAGE‐718 was generally well tolerated with no serious adverse events or deaths observed in the trial subjects. The most frequent treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported after SAGE‐718 administration were mild and numerically similar to those seen with placebo (TEAE: SAGE‐718, n = 6 (31.6%); placebo, n = 7 (33.3%)). No TEAEs resulted in discontinuation or dose reduction of SAGE‐718. No significant changes in clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, or ECGS were observed. Conclusions: Healthy volunteers dosed with SAGE‐718 exhibited greater improvement on tests of higher‐order working memory (Two‐Back Test) and complex problem solving (Groton Maze Test), which at times reached the threshold for statistical significance as compared to subjects receiving placebo. SAGE‐718 was generally well tolerated by the trial subjects over 10 days of exposure. Improvements in executive performance, as reflected by significant improvements on the Two‐Back and Groton Maze Tests, suggest that further investigation of SAGE‐718 is warranted for the treatment of conditions characterized by states of relative NMDA hypofunction, particularly those manifesting with executive deficits.","###Task

Background: Several measures have been developed to examine acute psychedelic effects (e.g. mystical-type and challenging experiences), but no measure assesses acute psychologically insightful experiences that may occur during psychedelic experiences. Aim: The purpose of this study was to develop and examine the psychometric properties of the Psychological Insight Questionnaire. Method: A cross-sectional survey study among psilocybin and LSD users.

Results: The Psychological Insight Questionnaire consists of 23 items with two subscales: (a) Avoidance and Maladaptive Patterns Insights and (b) Goals and Adaptive Patterns Insights.

An extended battery of neuropsychological tests was administered to three groups of college seniors (lysergic acid diethylamide [LSD]/mescaline users; marihuana/hashish users; and controls) who were matched on predrug usage intellectual and personality dimensions. The study was replicated one yr later. In the combined years' analyses, the three groups showed statistically significant differences only on the Trail Making Test: LSD/mescaline users performed within normal limits but significantly worse than either of the other two groups. Since the three groups also differed significantly in the extent of their alcohol usage, a covariance analysis was carried out that indicated that this variable did not account for the LSD/mescaline group's performance on the Trail Making Test. Inference about possible organic dysfunction cannot be drawn from these findings, but prospective neuropsychological testing might prove useful. (15 references).","###Task

INPUT: Neuropsychological assessment of undergraduate marihuana and LSD users.^
An extended battery of neuropsychological tests was administered to three groups of college seniors (lysergic acid diethylamide [LSD]/mescaline users; marihuana/hashish users; and controls) who were matched on predrug usage intellectual and personality dimensions. The study was replicated one yr later. In the combined years' analyses, the three groups showed statistically significant differences only on the Trail Making Test: LSD/mescaline users performed within normal limits but significantly worse than either of the other two groups. Since the three groups also differed significantly in the extent of their alcohol usage, a covariance analysis was carried out that indicated that this variable did not account for the LSD/mescaline group's performance on the Trail Making Test. Inference about possible organic dysfunction cannot be drawn from these findings, but prospective neuropsychological testing might prove useful. (15 references).

7337,"P.0622 Cue-reactivity task in patients with alcohol use disorder.^
Background: Half a billion people globally exhibit a harmful use of alcohol, resulting in 3 million deaths (5.3% of all deaths) in 2016 and 132.6 million Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost (5.1% of all DALYs) [1]. Even though, a wide range of medication has been approved for the treatment of alcohol use disorders (AUDs), their efficacy is limited [2]. Craving is a prominent factor leading to chronic alcohol use and, therefore, it is essential to understand its underlying mechanisms. Drug‐related cues act as trigger for craving and enhance drug‐seeking behaviour [3]. Cue‐reactivity tasks were developed to induce craving within an experimental setting and investigate its underlying neurobiological mechanisms [4]. Neural reactivity to alcohol‐related cues is an important factor for developing effective treatments for AUD. Therefore, we are assessing neural reactivity to an alcohol‐related cue‐reactivity task in patients with AUD. Methods: This analysis is part of a larger phase II clinical trial, assessing the efficacy of psilocybin for relapse prevention in AUD and studying its underlying neurobiological mechanisms in a randomized, placebo‐controlled, between‐subject, double‐blind design. The study is ongoing, and we analysed seven patients with AUD after undergoing withdrawal treatment. The fMRI cue‐reactivity task includes positive, neutral, and alcohol‐related pictures showing the patients’ favourite beverage and lasted for about 7 minutes. Approximately half of the patients received psilocybin‐supported therapy, the other half treatment as usual. We compared neural reactivity to alcohol‐related pictures before. Furthermore, self‐rated craving was assessed and included in the analysis. This analysis examines the general therapy effect across both groups. Therapy (pre and post) and group effects will be investigated after completion of the study. Furthermore, subjective craving measures, assessed with the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale, alcohol abstinence self‐efficacy and quality of life were included in the analysis. Cue‐reactivity fMRI data were preprocessed and analysed using SPM12. Results: Patients with AUD showed increased reactivity in addiction‐related brain areas such as parahippocampal gyrus (p<.001, FDR‐corrected), basal ganglia (p<.001, FDR‐corrected), medial frontal gyrus (p<.05, FDR‐corrected), and right thalamus (p<.05, FDR‐corrected) in response to alcohol‐related compared to neutral pictures before treatment. Comparing alcohol‐related pictures to positive pictures, only the left declive (p<.05, FDR‐corrected) reached significance. Self‐reported craving was not significantly decreased in response to the cue‐reactivity task (d=‐0.01, 95% CI [‐0.46, 0.44], p=.724). Discussion: Further analyses will involve neural alteration in response to treatment and group differences. Additionally, we will investigate whether the above reported brain regions change over the course of the treatment. Conclusion: This study has direct clinical implications for the treatment of AUD, by pinpointing brain regions involved in self‐rated alcohol craving and investigating neural correlates in response to a cue‐reactivity task before treatment. Furthermore, it increases our mechanistic understanding of clinically relevant correlates of addiction therefore establishing biomarkers that are critical for the development of novel therapeutics.

120,"Can 'floating' predict treatment response to ketamine? Data from three randomized trials of individuals with treatment-resistant depression.^
Ketamine has rapid-acting antidepressant properties but also potentially concerning transient dissociative side effects (SEs).

This analysis sought to determine whether floating mediates treatment response to ketamine. Data were pooled from three double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled ketamine clinical trials across which 82 participants with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) (44 with bipolar depression and 38 with major depressive disorder) received placebo and ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) infusions. SEs were actively solicited in a standardized fashion before and after ketamine infusion. The hypothesis that a post-infusion experience of floating would mediate antidepressant response to ketamine was assessed at 230 min post-infusion and at Day 1. Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score was the dependent variable in a linear mixed effects model. Ketamine significantly decreased MADRS scores (p < 0.0001), but no relationship was detected between floating and MADRS score at either 230 min or Day 1 post-infusion.

6302,"Using ketamine to model semantic deficits in schizophrenia.^
Semantic deficits constitute a core cognitive abnormality in schizophrenia. In the current study, the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine was administered to healthy individuals acutely while they performed semantic processing tasks that included word pairs of differing degrees of semantic relatedness. Two dimensions of semantic processing were investigated: (1) explicit versus implicit processing, that is, unconscious versus conscious processing of semantic relationships and (2) direct versus indirect processing, that is, word pairs that are closely (LION-TIGER) or distantly (LION-STRIPES) related. The immediate effects of ketamine (0.8 mg/kg per hour during 80 minutes with approximate target plasma levels of 200 ng/mL) were examined in a placebo-controlled double-blind repeated-measures group design with 19 participants. It was predicted that ketamine would disrupt access to semantic memory as evidenced in schizophrenia, especially the indirectly related word pairs. In addition, implicit processing and explicit processing were predicted to be differentially affected. Ketamine administration did result in an abnormal performance in the reaction time responses to implicitly presented indirectly related word pairs (ie, greater priming) and reduced accuracy for explicit pairs. Performance on the directly related word pair tasks (both implicit and explicit) was similar across ketamine and placebo conditions, except for the suggestion of abnormal semantic matching in the accuracy data in the implicit task. This study confirms that implicit indirect semantic processing is changed under the influences of ketamine akin to schizophrenia. Future research comparing a schizophrenia group and a ketamine group directly about these tasks is needed to determine the similarity of impairments.","###Task

This study confirms that implicit indirect semantic processing is changed under the influences of ketamine akin to schizophrenia. Future research comparing a schizophrenia group and a ketamine group directly about these tasks is needed to determine the similarity of impairments.

6979,"Modulatory effect of the 5-HT1A agonist buspirone and the mixed non-hallucinogenic 5-HT1A/2A agonist ergotamine on psilocybin-induced psychedelic experience.^
The mixed serotonin (5-HT) 1A/2A/2B/2C/6/7 receptor agonist psilocybin dose-dependently induces an altered state of consciousness (ASC) that is characterized by changes in sensory perception, mood, thought, and the sense of self. The psychological effects of psilocybin are primarily mediated by 5-HT2A receptor activation. However, accumulating evidence suggests that 5-HT1A or an interaction between 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors may contribute to the overall effects of psilocybin. Therefore, we used a double-blind, counterbalanced, within-subject design to investigate the modulatory effects of the partial 5-HT1A agonist buspirone (20mg p.o.) and the non-hallucinogenic 5-HT2A/1A agonist ergotamine (3mg p.o.) on psilocybin-induced (170 µg/kg p.o.) psychological effects in two groups (n=19, n=17) of healthy human subjects. Psychological effects were assessed using the Altered State of Consciousness (5D-ASC) rating scale. Buspirone significantly reduced the 5D-ASC main scale score for Visionary Restructuralization (VR) (p<0.001), which was mostly driven by a reduction of the VR item cluster scores for elementary and complex visual hallucinations. Further, buspirone also reduced the main scale score for Oceanic Boundlessness (OB) including derealisation and depersonalisation phenomena at a trend level (p=0.062), whereas ergotamine did not show any effects on the psilocybin-induced 5D-ASC main scale scores. The present finding demonstrates that buspirone exerts inhibitory effects on psilocybin-induced effects, presumably via 5-HT1A receptor activation, an interaction between 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors, or both. The data suggest that the modulation of 5-HT1A receptor activity may be a useful target in the treatment of visual hallucinations in different psychiatric and neurological diseases.","###Task

Your task is to generate an HTML version of an input text, marking up specific entities. The entities to be identified are: Application area, Dosage. Use HTML <span> tags to highlight these entities. Each <span> should have a class attribute indicating the type of entity.

###Entity Markup Guide
Use <span class=""application-area""> to denote Application area, <span class=""dosage""> to denote Dosage.

###Entity Defintions
Application area is defined as: The condition or disease of interest studied under the impact of the psychedelic substance in the present paper.

Dosage is defined as: The applied dosage(s) of the psychedelic substance(s) in the present study.

###Annotation Guidelines
Application area should be annotated according to the following criteria:
* Our working definition for the Application is any ""state labeled as diseases by virtue of consensus on prevalent sociocultural and medical values"". It has to have ""clearly identifiable diagnostic features and disease progression, and response to specific treatment.""
* As a general guideline, annotated entities should be conditions that have an ICD-10/11 code.
* Annotate only in title and/or the introductory part of the abstract, i.e., when the problem or objective of the study is discussed (including abbreviations). Do NOT annotate outcomes, such as ""the Hamilton Depression Scale"" should not be annotated. Similarly, ""antisuicidal response"" should not be annotated. Or: ""among participants, depression was reduced"", do NOT annotate depression.
* Do NOT annotate antidepressant.
* Do not annotate over brackets: ""…or bipolar disorder (BD) type 1 and type 2"", only bipolar disorder and BD should be annotated as two entities.
* Do NOT annotate very generic concepts like ""psychiatric condition""
* Annotate sweeping statements like ""…with major depressive and bipolar disorder"" as one entity.
* Annotate the reasonably necessary string, e.g., ""active suicidal ideation"", active suicidal ideation should be annotated. However, adjectives could be annotated, ""Depressed patients"", annotate Depressed but not patients. ""depressive symptoms"" should both be annotated (also symptoms of depression). In ""refractory anxiety disorder"", annotate the entire string.
* Further defining characteristics should be included: Acute/Chronic; Active/Inactive; Mild/Moderate/Severe; End Stage/Early Stage; Drug-resistant; Total/Partial; Intermittent/Relapsing and others. Similarly, ""Post-stroke"" should be annotated instead of only ""stroke"" because it refers to the phase after the acute stroke.
* Annotate abbreviations. Abbreviations should be annotated  separately. For instance,""Huntington disease (HD)""should be separated into two annotations: ""Huntington disease"" and ""HD.
* Of note, in ""Managing dissociative symptoms following esketamine"", dissociative symptoms are NOT the treatment target but the target of the study and should NOT be annotated (context is relevant).
* Cigarette addiction is a disorder but not smoking cessation.
* Can be empty, i.e., no annotation per abstract.
* Include .^ in the title for highlighting

Dosage should be annotated according to the following criteria:
* Only annotate for studies testing not more than 1 psychedelic substance (e.g., do not annotate in a study testing lsd and psilocybin, BUT annotate in a study testing psilocybin against midazolam)
* Do NOT annotate doses of other substances or of the psychedelic substance in other studies (e.g, mentioned by referencing other studies)
* Do not annotate concentrations of solutions but dosages, i.e., do NOT annotate 500mg/10 ml, but annotate 2mg/kg.
* Annotate the number and the corresponding unit.
* Annotate all reported doses for the respective psychedelic substance.
* Annotate only for single substance studies (i.e., do not annotate in abstracts which report the dosage of two or more psychedelic substances).
* Annotate the number including the unit.
* Annotate also the term ""between"" if pertinent, similarly ""or"" and ""and"" should be annotated. Do not annotate ""per device"".
* Annotate also relative dosages (e.g., 1 mg/kg), do not annotate the terms ""bw"" or ""body weight"" or similar if pertinent
* Do NOT annotate doses measured in e.g., plasma (like 4 mg/ml)
* Can be empty, i.e, no annotation per abstract.

The experiences induced by psychedelics share a wide variety of subjective features, related to the complex changes in perception and cognition induced by this class of drugs. A remarkable increase in introspection is at the core of these altered states of consciousness. Self-oriented mental activity has been consistently linked to the Default Mode Network (DMN), a set of brain regionsmore active during rest than during the execution of a goal-directed task. Here we used fMRI technique to inspect the DMN during the psychedelic state induced by Ayahuasca in ten experienced subjects. Ayahuasca is a potion traditionally used by Amazonian Amerindians composed by a mixture of compounds that increase monoaminergic transmission. In particular, we examined whether Ayahuasca changes the activity and connectivity of the DMN and the connection between the DMN and the task-positive network (TPN). Ayahuasca caused a significant decrease in activity throughmost parts of the DMN, including its most consistent hubs: the Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC)/Precuneus and the medial Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC). Functional connectivity within the PCC/Precuneus decreased after Ayahuasca intake. No significant change was observed in the DMN-TPN orthogonality.

5930,"Classical psychedelics for the treatment of depression and anxiety: A systematic review.^
BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety are prevalent psychiatric disorders that carry significant morbidity. Pharmacological and psychosocial interventions are used to manage these conditions, but their efficacy is limited. Recent interest into the use of psychedelic-assisted therapy using ayahuasca, psilocybin or lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) may be a promising alternative for patients unresponsive to traditional treatments. This review aims to determine the efficacy and tolerability of psychedelics in the management of resistant depression. METHODS: Clinical trials investigating psychedelics in patients with depression and/or anxiety were searched via MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsychINFO. Efficacy was assessed by measuring symptom improvement from baseline, and tolerability was evaluated by noting the incidence and type of adverse effects reported. Risk of bias was assessed. RESULTS: Seven studies, with 130 patients, were analysed in this review. Three were conducted in patients with depression, two in patients with anxiety and two in patients with both. In a supportive setting, ayahuasca, psilocybin, and LSD consistently produced immediate and significant anti-depressant and anxiolytic effects that were endured for several months.

4355,"MDMA effects consistent across laboratories.^
RATIONALE: Several laboratories have conducted placebo-controlled drug challenge studies with 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), providing a unique source of data to examine the reliability of the acute effects of the drug across subject samples and settings. We examined the subjective and physiological responses to the drug across three different laboratories and investigated the influence of prior MDMA use. METHODS: Overall, 220 healthy volunteers with varying levels of previous MDMA experience participated in laboratory-based studies in which they received placebo or MDMA orally (1.5 mg/kg or 125-mg fixed dose) under double-blind conditions. Cardiovascular and subjective effects were assessed before and repeatedly after drug administration. The studies were conducted independently by investigators in Basel, San Francisco, and Chicago. RESULTS: Despite methodological differences between the studies and differences in the subjects' drug use histories, MDMA produced very similar cardiovascular and subjective effects across the sites.

Dosage is defined as: The applied dosage(s) of the psychedelic substance(s) in the present study.

###Annotation Guidelines
Application area should be annotated according to the following criteria:
* Our working definition for the Application is any ""state labeled as diseases by virtue of consensus on prevalent sociocultural and medical values"". It has to have ""clearly identifiable diagnostic features and disease progression, and response to specific treatment.""
* As a general guideline, annotated entities should be conditions that have an ICD-10/11 code.
* Annotate only in title and/or the introductory part of the abstract, i.e., when the problem or objective of the study is discussed (including abbreviations). Do NOT annotate outcomes, such as ""the Hamilton Depression Scale"" should not be annotated. Similarly, ""antisuicidal response"" should not be annotated. Or: ""among participants, depression was reduced"", do NOT annotate depression.
* Do NOT annotate antidepressant.
* Do not annotate over brackets: ""…or bipolar disorder (BD) type 1 and type 2"", only bipolar disorder and BD should be annotated as two entities.

* Annotate the reasonably necessary string, e.g., ""active suicidal ideation"", active suicidal ideation should be annotated. However, adjectives could be annotated, ""Depressed patients"", annotate Depressed but not patients. ""depressive symptoms"" should both be annotated (also symptoms of depression). In ""refractory anxiety disorder"", annotate the entire string.
* Further defining characteristics should be included: Acute/Chronic; Active/Inactive; Mild/Moderate/Severe; End Stage/Early Stage; Drug-resistant; Total/Partial; Intermittent/Relapsing and others. Similarly, ""Post-stroke"" should be annotated instead of only ""stroke"" because it refers to the phase after the acute stroke.
* Annotate abbreviations. Abbreviations should be annotated  separately. For instance,""Huntington disease (HD)""should be separated into two annotations: ""Huntington disease"" and ""HD.

INPUT: MDMA effects consistent across laboratories.^
RATIONALE: Several laboratories have conducted placebo-controlled drug challenge studies with 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), providing a unique source of data to examine the reliability of the acute effects of the drug across subject samples and settings. We examined the subjective and physiological responses to the drug across three different laboratories and investigated the influence of prior MDMA use. METHODS: Overall, 220 healthy volunteers with varying levels of previous MDMA experience participated in laboratory-based studies in which they received placebo or MDMA orally (1.5 mg/kg or 125-mg fixed dose) under double-blind conditions. Cardiovascular and subjective effects were assessed before and repeatedly after drug administration. The studies were conducted independently by investigators in Basel, San Francisco, and Chicago. RESULTS: Despite methodological differences between the studies and differences in the subjects' drug use histories, MDMA produced very similar cardiovascular and subjective effects across the sites. The participants' prior use of MDMA was inversely related to feeling ""Any Drug Effect"" only at sites testing more experienced users. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the pharmacological effects of MDMA are robust and highly reproducible across settings.

OBJECTIVES: MDMA is one of the most commonly used drugs in the world. Clinical studies are currently being conducted around the world on the use of this substance in the treatment of PTSD and alcoholism. However, little demographic information is available on users who use the substance for recreational purposes. The aim was to determine basic demographic and helath characteristics with validated tools. METHODS: The authors prepared an original questionnaire on the demography of MDMA users and combined it with the General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The survey was sent to Polish MDMA users via the Internet. RESULTS: 304 responses were received from people over 18 years of age. MDMA is widespread among young adults, in many different places of residence and regardless of gender. The users take MDMA in both pill and crystal form and very rarely test drugs bought from a dealer. Most users feel that MDMA has had a good impact on their lives. CONCLUSIONS: MDMA is rarely used as the only psychoactive substance. MDMA users rate their health higher than people using other psychoactive substances.","###Task

5828,"Effect of intranasal esketamine on cognitive functioning in healthy participants: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.^
BACKGROUND: The effect of intranasal esketamine on cognitive functioning in healthy participants is assessed in this study. METHODS: Twenty-four participants (19-49 years) were randomized to one of two treatment sequences in which either esketamine 84 mg or placebo was intranasally administered in a double-blind, two-period crossover design. Primary measures included five tests of Cogstate(®) computerized test battery assessed at 1 h predose and 40 min, 2, 4, and 6 h postdose. Secondary measures included the Mental Effort Scale, Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), and safety. RESULTS: Esketamine was associated with significant cognitive performance impairment at 40 min postdose for all five Cogstate® tests (Detection p = 0.0011, Identification p = 0.0006, One-Card Learning p = 0.0040, One Back p = 0.0017, and Groton Maze Learning Test p < 0.0001) versus placebo. In contrast, performance on these tests did not differ significantly between esketamine and placebo at 2, 4, or 6 h postdose. Secondary outcomes indicated a significant, transient increase from baseline under esketamine versus placebo at 40 min postdose on the Mental Effort Scale and at 40 min and 2 h postdose on KSS (p < 0.0001 for both); however, no significant difference was observed on these outcomes between esketamine and placebo at later timepoints. The most commonly reported adverse events were dizziness (67%), nausea (37.5%), disturbance in attention (29.2%), and fatigue (29.2%); the majority were considered mild in severity. CONCLUSIONS: Esketamine was associated with cognitive performance decline, and greater effort was required to complete the test battery versus placebo at 40 min postdose, which returned to placebo-comparable levels by 2 h postdose.

Ketamine is a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist used for analgesia in patients with chronic pain. This article describes a retrospective review of 21 Ss (aged 29–81 yrs) with chronic neuropathic pain who were treated with oral ketamine as an adjunct to ongoing therapy with individualized combinations of opioids, anticonvulsants, and antidepressants. Ss were treated with oral ketamine starting at a divided dose of 100 mg/day and titrating upwards by 40 mg/day until efficacy was reached, or until side effects became limiting. A retrospective chart review was conducted to evaluate the analgesic efficacy and side effects of the treatment. Nine Ss discontinued ketamine because of intolerable side effects, 4 Ss experienced few or no side effects but had no discernible benefit, 4 others had equivocal responses. Four Ss had continued oral ketamine for long periods. One patient has had no significant benefit or side effects but continues to use ketamine 500 mg/day and 3 people used doses ranging from 100–240 mg day for over 1 year duration and have reported improvements in pain and decreased use of analgesics.

5041,"Effects of perioperative use of esketamine on postpartum depression risk in patients undergoing cesarean section: A randomized controlled trial.^
BACKGROUND: Postpartum depression (PPD) is a prevalent public health issue. Although ketamine has prophylactic effects on PPD in women undergoing cesarean section, the effects of esketamine on PPD remain unclear. This trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy of perioperative esketamine infusion on PPD risk by assessing Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scores and blood biomarkers. METHODS: A total of 150 participants undergoing elective cesarean section were randomly allocated to receive either esketamine or normal saline. Since 27 participants were excluded due to consent withdrawal or loss to follow-up, 123 patients were included. The primary outcome was the prevalence of PPD risk. Secondary outcomes included the prevalence of postpartum anxiety (PPA) risk, levels of biomarkers, postoperative pain intensity, and cumulative sufentanil consumption. RESULTS: The prevalence of PPD and PPA risk at 3 days, 42 days, 3 months, and 6 months postpartum did not differ between the two groups. Furthermore, EPDS scores, pain intensity at rest, and during coughing on postoperative days (POD) 1 and 2 did not differ between the two groups.

Psychedelics have attracted medical interest, but their effects on human brain function are incompletely understood. In a comprehensive, within-subjects, placebo-controlled design, we acquired multimodal neuroimaging [i.e., EEG-fMRI (electroencephalography-functional MRI)] data to assess the effects of intravenous (IV) N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) on brain function in 20 healthy volunteers. Simultaneous EEG-fMRI was acquired prior to, during, and after a bolus IV administration of 20 mg DMT, and, separately, placebo. At dosages consistent with the present study, DMT, a serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) agonist, induces a deeply immersive and radically altered state of consciousness. DMT is thus a useful research tool for probing the neural correlates of conscious experience. Here, fMRI results revealed robust increases in global functional connectivity (GFC), network disintegration and desegregation, and a compression of the principal cortical gradient under DMT.

Changes in major EEG-measured neurophysiological properties correlated with specific changes in various fMRI metrics, enriching our understanding of the neural basis of DMT's effects. The present findings advance on previous work by confirming a predominant action of DMT-and likely other 5-HT2AR agonist psychedelics-on the brain's transmodal association pole, i.e., the neurodevelopmentally and evolutionarily recent cortex that is associated with species-specific psychological advancements, and high expression of 5-HT2A receptors.","###Task

4579,"Subanesthetic effects of the noncompetitive NMDA antagonist, ketamine, in humans. Psychotomimetic, perceptual, cognitive, and neuroendocrine responses.^
BACKGROUND: To characterize further behavioral, cognitive, neuroendocrine, and physiological effects of subanesthetic doses of ketamine hydrochloride in healthy human subjects. Ketamine, a phencyclidine hydrochloride derivative, is a dissociative anesthetic and a noncompetitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of excitatory amino acid receptor. METHODS: Nineteen healthy subjects recruited by advertisements from the community participated in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Subjects completed three test days involving the 40-minute intravenous administration of placebo, ketamine hydrochloride (0.1 mg/kg), or ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg). Behaviors associated with the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia were assessed by using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Changes in perception and behaviors associated with dissociative states were assessed by the Perceptual Aberration Subscale of the Wisconsin Psychosis Proneness Scale and the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale. Cognitive function was assessed by using the (1) Mini-Mental State Examination; (2) tests sensitive to frontal cortical dysfunction, including a continuous performance vigilance task, a verbal fluency task, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; and (3) tests of immediate and delayed recall. Plasma levels of cortisol, prolactin, homovanillic acid, and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethyleneglycol were measured. RESULTS: Ketamine (1) produced behaviors similar to the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia; (2) elicited alterations in perception; (3) impaired performance on tests of vigilance, verbal fluency, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; (4) evoked symptoms similar to dissociative states; and (5) preferentially disrupted delayed word recall, sparing immediate recall and postdistraction recall. Ketamine had no significant effect on the Mini-Mental State Examination at the doses studied. Ketamine also had no effect on plasma 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethyleneglycol levels, although it blunted a test day decline in plasma homovanillic acid levels at the higher dose. It also dose dependently increased plasma cortisol and prolactin levels. Ketamine produced small dose-dependent increases in blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists produce a broad range of symptoms, behaviors, and cognitive deficits that resemble aspects of endogenous psychoses, particularly schizophrenia and dissociative states.","###Task

* Our working definition for the Application is any ""state labeled as diseases by virtue of consensus on prevalent sociocultural and medical values"". It has to have ""clearly identifiable diagnostic features and disease progression, and response to specific treatment.""
* As a general guideline, annotated entities should be conditions that have an ICD-10/11 code.
* Annotate only in title and/or the introductory part of the abstract, i.e., when the problem or objective of the study is discussed (including abbreviations). Do NOT annotate outcomes, such as ""the Hamilton Depression Scale"" should not be annotated. Similarly, ""antisuicidal response"" should not be annotated. Or: ""among participants, depression was reduced"", do NOT annotate depression.
* Do NOT annotate antidepressant.
* Do not annotate over brackets: ""…or bipolar disorder (BD) type 1 and type 2"", only bipolar disorder and BD should be annotated as two entities.
* Do NOT annotate very generic concepts like ""psychiatric condition""
* Annotate sweeping statements like ""…with major depressive and bipolar disorder"" as one entity.
* Annotate the reasonably necessary string, e.g., ""active suicidal ideation"", active suicidal ideation should be annotated. However, adjectives could be annotated, ""Depressed patients"", annotate Depressed but not patients. ""depressive symptoms"" should both be annotated (also symptoms of depression). In ""refractory anxiety disorder"", annotate the entire string.
* Further defining characteristics should be included: Acute/Chronic; Active/Inactive; Mild/Moderate/Severe; End Stage/Early Stage; Drug-resistant; Total/Partial; Intermittent/Relapsing and others. Similarly, ""Post-stroke"" should be annotated instead of only ""stroke"" because it refers to the phase after the acute stroke.
* Annotate abbreviations. Abbreviations should be annotated  separately. For instance,""Huntington disease (HD)""should be separated into two annotations: ""Huntington disease"" and ""HD.
* Of note, in ""Managing dissociative symptoms following esketamine"", dissociative symptoms are NOT the treatment target but the target of the study and should NOT be annotated (context is relevant).
* Cigarette addiction is a disorder but not smoking cessation.
* Can be empty, i.e., no annotation per abstract.
* Include .^ in the title for highlighting

Dosage should be annotated according to the following criteria:
* Only annotate for studies testing not more than 1 psychedelic substance (e.g., do not annotate in a study testing lsd and psilocybin, BUT annotate in a study testing psilocybin against midazolam)
* Do NOT annotate doses of other substances or of the psychedelic substance in other studies (e.g, mentioned by referencing other studies)
* Do not annotate concentrations of solutions but dosages, i.e., do NOT annotate 500mg/10 ml, but annotate 2mg/kg.
* Annotate the number and the corresponding unit.
* Annotate all reported doses for the respective psychedelic substance.
* Annotate only for single substance studies (i.e., do not annotate in abstracts which report the dosage of two or more psychedelic substances).
* Annotate the number including the unit.
* Annotate also the term ""between"" if pertinent, similarly ""or"" and ""and"" should be annotated. Do not annotate ""per device"".
* Annotate also relative dosages (e.g., 1 mg/kg), do not annotate the terms ""bw"" or ""body weight"" or similar if pertinent
* Do NOT annotate doses measured in e.g., plasma (like 4 mg/ml)
* Can be empty, i.e, no annotation per abstract.

INPUT: Subanesthetic effects of the noncompetitive NMDA antagonist, ketamine, in humans. Psychotomimetic, perceptual, cognitive, and neuroendocrine responses.^
BACKGROUND: To characterize further behavioral, cognitive, neuroendocrine, and physiological effects of subanesthetic doses of ketamine hydrochloride in healthy human subjects. Ketamine, a phencyclidine hydrochloride derivative, is a dissociative anesthetic and a noncompetitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of excitatory amino acid receptor. METHODS: Nineteen healthy subjects recruited by advertisements from the community participated in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Subjects completed three test days involving the 40-minute intravenous administration of placebo, ketamine hydrochloride (0.1 mg/kg), or ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg). Behaviors associated with the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia were assessed by using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Changes in perception and behaviors associated with dissociative states were assessed by the Perceptual Aberration Subscale of the Wisconsin Psychosis Proneness Scale and the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale. Cognitive function was assessed by using the (1) Mini-Mental State Examination; (2) tests sensitive to frontal cortical dysfunction, including a continuous performance vigilance task, a verbal fluency task, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; and (3) tests of immediate and delayed recall. Plasma levels of cortisol, prolactin, homovanillic acid, and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethyleneglycol were measured. RESULTS: Ketamine (1) produced behaviors similar to the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia; (2) elicited alterations in perception; (3) impaired performance on tests of vigilance, verbal fluency, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; (4) evoked symptoms similar to dissociative states; and (5) preferentially disrupted delayed word recall, sparing immediate recall and postdistraction recall. Ketamine had no significant effect on the Mini-Mental State Examination at the doses studied. Ketamine also had no effect on plasma 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethyleneglycol levels, although it blunted a test day decline in plasma homovanillic acid levels at the higher dose. It also dose dependently increased plasma cortisol and prolactin levels. Ketamine produced small dose-dependent increases in blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists produce a broad range of symptoms, behaviors, and cognitive deficits that resemble aspects of endogenous psychoses, particularly schizophrenia and dissociative states.

6027,"Emotional Effects of Methylphenidate and MDMA in Healthy Subjects.^
3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""ecstasy"") is widely used by young people for its euphoric effects. MDMA releases serotonin (5‐HT), dopamine (DA), and norepinephrine (NE). 5‐HT release mainly contributes to the subjective effects of MDMA whereas NE release is involved in the cardiovascular and psychostimulant effects of MDMA. DA is also likely to be involved in the rewarding and reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse. However, the functional role of DA in the subjective effects of MDMA in humans is largely unclear. To determine the role of the DA transporter (DAT) in the response to MDMA in humans the investigators test the effects of the DA and NE transporter blocker methylphenidate on the subjective effects of MDMA. The investigators use a randomized double‐blind placebo‐controlled cross‐over design with four experimental sessions. methylphenidate or placebo will be administered before MDMA or placebo to 16 healthy volunteers. Subjective and cardiovascular responses will be repeatedly assessed throughout the experiments and plasma samples are collected for pharmacokinetics. The primary hypothesis is that methylphenidate will significantly reduce the subjective effects of MDMA.","###Task

764,"RESULTS FROM THE PHASE I SMALL PHARMA TRIAL OF SPL026 IN PSYCHEDELIC-NAÏVE HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS.^
Background/Objective: Small Pharma is conducting the world's first regulated Phase I/IIa clinical trial of SPL026 (N,Ndimethyltryptamine [DMT] fumarate), a psychedelic compound with a shortacting experience, in combination with psychotherapy, in major depressive disorder (MDD). Design: We have completed the Phase I component, a double‐blind, singleascending dose study, assessing safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of four intravenous (IV) doses of SPL026 with therapy in psychedelic‐naive healthy volunteers (6 active and 2 placebo per cohort). Results: SPL026 was safe and well tolerated, with no serious adverse events and few drug‐related adverse events across all dose cohorts. Detailed PK profiles for DMT were elucidated, and a model was developed to understand and predict the PK profiles of various doses of SPL026. DMT is rapidly metabolized, with a half‐life of about 11 minutes, which underpins the observed short psychedelic experiences of up to 30 minutes. Following PK/PD analysis, a strong exposureresponse relationship for both the intensity and quality of the psychedelic experience was demonstrated. In addition, no correlation between exposure versus age, weight, or body mass index (BMI) of subjects was shown. Conclusion: We have developed a safe and well‐tolerated IV infusion protocol and accompanying psychotherapy model for administration of SPL026 to elicit, in a dose‐predictive way, a significant psychedelic experience with the potential to provide therapeutic efficacy in a number of mental health disorders. Psychedelics, such as DMT, offer the potential of an alternative treatment paradigm to the traditional selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or psychotherapy models currently available to patients.

9565,"Comparative effectiveness of repeated ketamine infusions in treating anhedonia in bipolar and unipolar depression.^
Objectives: Anhedonia is a common, persistent, and disabling phenomenon in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar depression (BD). This study was conducted to investigate the comparative effectiveness of repeated ketamine infusions in treating anhedonia in Chinese individuals suffering from MDD and BD. Methods: Ninety-seven individuals suffering from MDD (n = 77) or BD (n = 20) were treated with six intravenous infusions of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) administered over 40 min. Anhedonia was measured through the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). The antianhedonic response and remission were defined as ≥ 50% and ≥ 75% reduction in MADRS anhedonia subscale score one day after the sixth infusion, respectively. Results: Anti-anhedonic response and remission rates after the sixth ketamine infusion were 48.5% (95% confidence interval = 38.3%–58.6%) and 30.9% (95% confidence interval = 21.6%–40.3%), respectively. When compared to baseline, a significant reduction in the MADRS anhedonia subscale score was observed at 4 h after the first infusion and was maintained with repeated infusions at any time point (all Ps < 0.05). The anti-anhedonic effect of ketamine did not differ between the MDD and BD groups. Conclusion: This preliminary study found that repeated ketamine infusions appeared to be effective at rapidly ameliorating anhedonia, with similar efficacy in MDD and BD.

When compared to baseline, a significant reduction in the MADRS anhedonia subscale score was observed at 4 h after the first infusion and was maintained with repeated infusions at any time point (all Ps < 0.05). The anti-anhedonic effect of ketamine did not differ between the MDD and BD groups. Conclusion: This preliminary study found that repeated ketamine infusions appeared to be effective at rapidly ameliorating anhedonia, with similar efficacy in MDD and BD.

514,"Use patterns and self-reported effects of Salvia divinorum: an internet-based survey.^
BACKGROUND: There is growing use of Salvia divinorum (SD), a psychoactive plant that produces hallucinogen-like effects through a kappa opioid receptor (KOR) mechanism. Little is known about KOR agonist effects in humans and about users of SD. OBJECTIVES: To characterize the reasons, methods, and reported consequences of SD use. METHODS: Individuals reading SD-related pages of a drug-information website were invited to anonymously complete an online questionnaire if they had used SD. RESULTS: Participants (N=500) were 92.6% male and 23.4 ± 8.7 (mean ± s.d.) years old. They had used a median of six times (range 1-250). 80.6% probably or definitely would use SD again. Most participants (92.6%) typically smoked or vaporized SD product. When smoked, the drug's main effects were estimated to last 14.1 ± 12.8 (range 0.5-120) minutes.

CONCLUSIONS: SD is typically smoked, acute effects are brief, and persistent adverse effects are uncommon. In addition to acute hallucinogenic effects, SD may produce subacute increases in subjective well-being.

2783,"MDMA Increases Cooperation and Recruitment of Social Brain Areas When Playing Trustworthy Players in an Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma.^
Social decision-making is fundamental for successful functioning and can be affected in psychiatric illness and by serotoninergic modulation. The Prisoner's Dilemma is the archetypal paradigm to model cooperation and trust. However, the effect of serotonergic enhancement is poorly characterized, and its influence on the effect of variations in opponent behavior unknown. To address this, we conducted a study investigating how the serotonergic enhancer 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) modulates behavior and its neural correlates during an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma with both trustworthy and untrustworthy opponents. We administered 100 mg MDMA or placebo to 20 male participants in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. While being scanned, participants played repeated rounds with opponents who differed in levels of cooperation. On each round, participants chose to compete or cooperate and were asked to rate their trust in the other player. Cooperation with trustworthy, but not untrustworthy, opponents was enhanced following MDMA but not placebo (respectively: odds ratio = 2.01; 95% CI, 1.42-2.84, p < 0.001; odds ratio = 1.37; 95% CI, 0.78-2.30, not significant). Specifically, MDMA enhanced recovery from, but not the impact of, breaches in cooperation. During trial outcome, MDMA increased activation of four clusters incorporating precentral and supramarginal gyri, superior temporal cortex, central operculum/posterior insula, and supplementary motor area. There was a treatment × opponent interaction in right anterior insula and dorsal caudate. Trust ratings did not change across treatment sessions. MDMA increased cooperative behavior when playing trustworthy opponents. Underlying this was a change in brain activity of regions linked to social cognition. Our findings highlight the context-specific nature of MDMA's effect on social decision-making.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We provide a detailed analysis of the effect of 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) on cooperative behavior during interpersonal interactions, as well as the neural correlates underlying these effects. We find that, following administration of MDMA, participants behave more cooperatively, but only when interacting with trustworthy partners. While breaches of trustworthy behavior have a similar impact following administration of MDMA compared with placebo, MDMA facilitates a greater recovery from these breaches of trust. Underlying this altered behavior are changes in brain activity during the viewing of opponents' behavior in regions whose involvement in social processing is well established. This work provides new insights into the impact of MDMA on social interactions, emphasizing the important role of the behavior of others toward us.","###Task

5118,"Psychological and physiological effects of extended DMT.^
N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is a serotonergic psychedelic that induces a rapid and transient altered state of consciousness when inhaled or injected via bolus administration. Its marked and novel subjective effects make DMT a powerful tool for the neuroscientific study of consciousness and preliminary results show its potential role in treating mental health conditions. In a within-subjects, placebo-controlled study, we investigated a novel method of DMT administration involving a bolus injection paired with a constant-rate infusion, with the goal of extending the DMT experience. Pharmacokinetic parameters of DMT estimated from plasma data of a previous study of bolus intravenous DMT were used to derive dose regimens necessary to keep subjects in steady levels of immersion into the DMT experience over an extended period of 30 min, and four dose regimens consisting of a bolus loading dose and a slow-rate infusion were tested in eleven healthy volunteers (seven male, four female, mean age ± SD = 37.09 ± 8.93 years). The present method is effective for extending the DMT experience in a stable and tolerable fashion. While subjective effects were maintained over the period of active infusion, anxiety ratings remained low and heart rate habituated within 15 min, indicating psychological and physiological safety of extended DMT.

Your task is to generate an HTML version of an input text, marking up specific entities. The entities to be identified are: Application area, Dosage. Use HTML <span> tags to highlight these entities. Each <span> should have a class attribute indicating the type of entity.

###Entity Markup Guide
Use <span class=""application-area""> to denote Application area, <span class=""dosage""> to denote Dosage.

###Entity Defintions
Application area is defined as: The condition or disease of interest studied under the impact of the psychedelic substance in the present paper.

Dosage is defined as: The applied dosage(s) of the psychedelic substance(s) in the present study.

###Annotation Guidelines
Application area should be annotated according to the following criteria:
* Our working definition for the Application is any ""state labeled as diseases by virtue of consensus on prevalent sociocultural and medical values"". It has to have ""clearly identifiable diagnostic features and disease progression, and response to specific treatment.""
* As a general guideline, annotated entities should be conditions that have an ICD-10/11 code.
* Annotate only in title and/or the introductory part of the abstract, i.e., when the problem or objective of the study is discussed (including abbreviations). Do NOT annotate outcomes, such as ""the Hamilton Depression Scale"" should not be annotated. Similarly, ""antisuicidal response"" should not be annotated. Or: ""among participants, depression was reduced"", do NOT annotate depression.
* Do NOT annotate antidepressant.
* Do not annotate over brackets: ""…or bipolar disorder (BD) type 1 and type 2"", only bipolar disorder and BD should be annotated as two entities.
* Do NOT annotate very generic concepts like ""psychiatric condition""
* Annotate sweeping statements like ""…with major depressive and bipolar disorder"" as one entity.
* Annotate the reasonably necessary string, e.g., ""active suicidal ideation"", active suicidal ideation should be annotated. However, adjectives could be annotated, ""Depressed patients"", annotate Depressed but not patients. ""depressive symptoms"" should both be annotated (also symptoms of depression). In ""refractory anxiety disorder"", annotate the entire string.
* Further defining characteristics should be included: Acute/Chronic; Active/Inactive; Mild/Moderate/Severe; End Stage/Early Stage; Drug-resistant; Total/Partial; Intermittent/Relapsing and others. Similarly, ""Post-stroke"" should be annotated instead of only ""stroke"" because it refers to the phase after the acute stroke.
* Annotate abbreviations. Abbreviations should be annotated  separately. For instance,""Huntington disease (HD)""should be separated into two annotations: ""Huntington disease"" and ""HD.
* Of note, in ""Managing dissociative symptoms following esketamine"", dissociative symptoms are NOT the treatment target but the target of the study and should NOT be annotated (context is relevant).
* Cigarette addiction is a disorder but not smoking cessation.
* Can be empty, i.e., no annotation per abstract.
* Include .^ in the title for highlighting

Dosage should be annotated according to the following criteria:
* Only annotate for studies testing not more than 1 psychedelic substance (e.g., do not annotate in a study testing lsd and psilocybin, BUT annotate in a study testing psilocybin against midazolam)
* Do NOT annotate doses of other substances or of the psychedelic substance in other studies (e.g, mentioned by referencing other studies)
* Do not annotate concentrations of solutions but dosages, i.e., do NOT annotate 500mg/10 ml, but annotate 2mg/kg.
* Annotate the number and the corresponding unit.
* Annotate all reported doses for the respective psychedelic substance.
* Annotate only for single substance studies (i.e., do not annotate in abstracts which report the dosage of two or more psychedelic substances).
* Annotate the number including the unit.
* Annotate also the term ""between"" if pertinent, similarly ""or"" and ""and"" should be annotated. Do not annotate ""per device"".
* Annotate also relative dosages (e.g., 1 mg/kg), do not annotate the terms ""bw"" or ""body weight"" or similar if pertinent
* Do NOT annotate doses measured in e.g., plasma (like 4 mg/ml)
* Can be empty, i.e, no annotation per abstract.

INPUT: Psychological and physiological effects of extended DMT.^
N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is a serotonergic psychedelic that induces a rapid and transient altered state of consciousness when inhaled or injected via bolus administration. Its marked and novel subjective effects make DMT a powerful tool for the neuroscientific study of consciousness and preliminary results show its potential role in treating mental health conditions. In a within-subjects, placebo-controlled study, we investigated a novel method of DMT administration involving a bolus injection paired with a constant-rate infusion, with the goal of extending the DMT experience. Pharmacokinetic parameters of DMT estimated from plasma data of a previous study of bolus intravenous DMT were used to derive dose regimens necessary to keep subjects in steady levels of immersion into the DMT experience over an extended period of 30 min, and four dose regimens consisting of a bolus loading dose and a slow-rate infusion were tested in eleven healthy volunteers (seven male, four female, mean age ± SD = 37.09 ± 8.93 years). The present method is effective for extending the DMT experience in a stable and tolerable fashion. While subjective effects were maintained over the period of active infusion, anxiety ratings remained low and heart rate habituated within 15 min, indicating psychological and physiological safety of extended DMT. Plasma DMT concentrations increased consistently starting 10 min into DMT administration, whereas psychological effects plateaued into the desired steady state, suggesting the development of acute psychological tolerance to DMT. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of continuous IV DMT administration, laying the groundwork for the further development of this method of administration for basic and clinical research.

7466,"A Phase II, Open-Label Clinical Trial of Intranasal Ketamine for Depression in Patients with Cancer Receiving Palliative Care (INKeD-PC Study).^
Antidepressants require several weeks for the onset of action, a lag time that may exceed life expectancy in palliative care. Ketamine has demonstrated rapid antidepressant effects, but has been minimally studied in cancer and palliative care populations. Herein, the objective was to determine the feasibility, safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of intranasal racemic ketamine for major depressive disorder (MDD) in patients with advanced cancer. We conducted a single-arm, open-label phase II trial at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto, ON, Canada. Participants with advanced cancer with moderate to severe MDD received three flexible doses of intranasal (IN) ketamine (50−150 mg) over a one-week period. The primary efficacy outcome was an antidepressant response and remission rates as determined by the Montgomery−Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) from baseline to the Day 8 primary endpoint. Twenty participants were enrolled in the trial, receiving at least one dose of IN ketamine, with fifteen participants receiving all three doses. The Day 8 antidepressant response (MADRS decreased by >50%) and remission (MADRS < 10 on Day 8) rates were high at 70% and 45%, respectively. Mean MADRS scores decreased significantly from baseline (mean MADRS of 31, standard deviation 7.6) to Day 8 (11 +/− 7.4) with an overall decrease of 20 points (p < 0.001). Antidepressant effects were partially sustained in the second week in the absence of additional ketamine doses, with a Day 14 mean MADRS score of 14 +/− 9.9. Common adverse effects included fatigue, dissociation, nausea, dysgeusia and headaches; almost all adverse effects were mild and transient, resolving within 2 h of each ketamine dose with one dropout related to adverse effects (negative dissociative episode).

1278,"Neural correlates of the LSD experience revealed by multimodal neuroimaging.^
Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is the prototypical psychedelic drug, but its effects on the human brain have never been studied before with modern neuroimaging. Here, three complementary neuroimaging techniques: arterial spin labeling (ASL), blood oxygen leveldependent (BOLD) measures, and magnetoencephalography (MEG), implemented during resting state conditions, revealed marked changes in brain activity after LSD that correlated strongly with its characteristic psychological effects. Increased visual cortex cerebral blood flow (CBF), decreased visual cortex alpha power, and a greatly expanded primary visual cortex (V1) functional connectivity profile correlated strongly with ratings of visual hallucinations, implying that intrinsic brain activity exerts greater influence on visual processing in the psychedelic state, thereby defining its hallucinatory quality. LSD's marked effects on the visual cortex did not significantly correlate with the drug's other characteristic effects on consciousness, however. Rather, decreased connectivity between the parahippocampus and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) correlated strongly with ratings of ""ego-dissolution"" and ""altered meaning,"" implying the importance of this particular circuit for the maintenance of ""self"" or ""ego"" and its processing of ""meaning."" Strong relationships were also found between the different imaging metrics, enabling firmer inferences to be made about their functional significance. This uniquely comprehensive examination of the LSD state represents an important advance in scientific research with psychedelic drugs at a time of growing interest in their scientific and therapeutic value. The present results contribute important new insights into the characteristic hallucinatory and consciousness- altering properties of psychedelics that inform on how they can model certain pathological states and potentially treat others.","###Task

INPUT: Neural correlates of the LSD experience revealed by multimodal neuroimaging.^
Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is the prototypical psychedelic drug, but its effects on the human brain have never been studied before with modern neuroimaging. Here, three complementary neuroimaging techniques: arterial spin labeling (ASL), blood oxygen leveldependent (BOLD) measures, and magnetoencephalography (MEG), implemented during resting state conditions, revealed marked changes in brain activity after LSD that correlated strongly with its characteristic psychological effects. Increased visual cortex cerebral blood flow (CBF), decreased visual cortex alpha power, and a greatly expanded primary visual cortex (V1) functional connectivity profile correlated strongly with ratings of visual hallucinations, implying that intrinsic brain activity exerts greater influence on visual processing in the psychedelic state, thereby defining its hallucinatory quality. LSD's marked effects on the visual cortex did not significantly correlate with the drug's other characteristic effects on consciousness, however. Rather, decreased connectivity between the parahippocampus and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) correlated strongly with ratings of ""ego-dissolution"" and ""altered meaning,"" implying the importance of this particular circuit for the maintenance of ""self"" or ""ego"" and its processing of ""meaning."" Strong relationships were also found between the different imaging metrics, enabling firmer inferences to be made about their functional significance. This uniquely comprehensive examination of the LSD state represents an important advance in scientific research with psychedelic drugs at a time of growing interest in their scientific and therapeutic value. The present results contribute important new insights into the characteristic hallucinatory and consciousness- altering properties of psychedelics that inform on how they can model certain pathological states and potentially treat others.

4101,"Efficacy of ketamine in the treatment of substance use disorders: A systematic review.^
Background: Despite advances in behavioral and pharmacotherapy interventions, substance use disorders (SUDs) are frequently refractory to treatment. Glutamatergic dysregulation has received increasing attention as one common neuropathology across multiple substances of abuse. Ketamine is a potent N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamatergic receptor antagonist which has been found to be effective in the treatment of severe depression. Here we review the literature on the efficacy of ketamine in the treatment of SUDs. Methods: A systematic review of the PubMed, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases was undertaken to identify completed and ongoing human studies of the effectiveness of ketamine in the treatment of SUDs between January 1997 and January 2018. Results and conclusion: Seven completed studies were identified. Two studies focused on alcohol use disorder, two focused on cocaine use disorder, and three focused on opioid use disorder. Both cocaine studies found improvements in craving, motivation, and decreased cocaine use rates, although studies were limited by small sample sizes, a homogeneous population and short follow-up. Studies of alcohol and opioid use disorders found improvement in abstinence rates in the ketamine group, with significant between-group effects noted for up to two years following a single infusion, although these were not placebo-controlled trials. These results suggest that ketamine may facilitate abstinence across multiple substances of abuse and warrants broader investigation in addiction treatment. We conclude with an overview of the six ongoing studies of ketamine in the treatment of alcohol, cocaine, cannabis, and opioid use disorders and discuss future directions in this emerging area of research.

Your task is to generate an HTML version of an input text, marking up specific entities. The entities to be identified are: Application area, Dosage. Use HTML <span> tags to highlight these entities. Each <span> should have a class attribute indicating the type of entity.

###Entity Markup Guide
Use <span class=""application-area""> to denote Application area, <span class=""dosage""> to denote Dosage.

###Entity Defintions
Application area is defined as: The condition or disease of interest studied under the impact of the psychedelic substance in the present paper.

Dosage is defined as: The applied dosage(s) of the psychedelic substance(s) in the present study.

###Annotation Guidelines
Application area should be annotated according to the following criteria:
* Our working definition for the Application is any ""state labeled as diseases by virtue of consensus on prevalent sociocultural and medical values"". It has to have ""clearly identifiable diagnostic features and disease progression, and response to specific treatment.""
* As a general guideline, annotated entities should be conditions that have an ICD-10/11 code.
* Annotate only in title and/or the introductory part of the abstract, i.e., when the problem or objective of the study is discussed (including abbreviations). Do NOT annotate outcomes, such as ""the Hamilton Depression Scale"" should not be annotated. Similarly, ""antisuicidal response"" should not be annotated. Or: ""among participants, depression was reduced"", do NOT annotate depression.
* Do NOT annotate antidepressant.
* Do not annotate over brackets: ""…or bipolar disorder (BD) type 1 and type 2"", only bipolar disorder and BD should be annotated as two entities.

8671,"Self-reported prevalence of dependence of MDMA compared to cocaine, mephedrone and ketamine among a sample of recreational poly-drug users.^
Background: Evidence regarding MDMA (ecstasy) dependence and the most suitable criteria for its assessment are controversial. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of last year symptoms of dependence upon MDMA compared to cocaine, mephedrone and ketamine among a large global non-treatment seeking sample. Methods: A cross-sectional anonymous online survey was promoted by a UK-based dance music website between 15 November 2010 and 1 January 2011. Endorsement of DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) dependence criteria was sought from all last year users of MDMA, cocaine, mephedrone and ketamine. Reporting ≥3 dependence symptoms was indicative of dependence. Logistic regression models with Generalized Estimating Equations were used to compare dependence symptoms between groups. Results: MDMA users were more likely to report ≥3 DSM-IV dependence symptoms compared to users of cocaine (odds ratio OR 0.81, 95% confidence interval CI 0.71-0.93), mephedrone (OR 0.91, 95%CI 0.78-1.06) and ketamine (OR 0.52, 95%CI 0.44-0.62) (. p<. 0.001). MDMA users were less likely to report desire to use less or get help compared to users of other substances (. p<. 0.001). MDMA got the highest rating of pleasurable high (mean 8.2. ±. 1.7) and lowest rating for risk of harm (mean 2.7. ±. 2.4). Conclusions: Our results highlight the self-reported dependence potential of MDMA but low desire to use less or get help. MDMA's pleasurable effects may compensate for drug-related problems and, therefore, DSM-IV criteria may not be suitable for assessing MDMA dependence.

9596,"Cardiovascular effects of repeated subanaesthetic ketamine infusion in depression.^
BACKGROUND: Ketamine produces significant rapid-onset and robust antidepressant effects in patients with major depressive disorder. However, this drug also has transient cardiovascular stimulatory effects, and there are limited data about potential predictors of these cardiovascular effects. METHODS: A total of 135 patients with unipolar and bipolar depression received a total of 741 ketamine infusions (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min). Blood pressure and pulse were monitored every 10 min during the infusions and 30 min after the infusions. Depressive, psychotomimetic and dissociative symptom severity was assessed at baseline and 4 hours after each infusion. RESULTS: The maximum blood pressure and pulse values were observed at 30-40 min during infusions. The largest mean systolic/diastolic blood pressure increases were 7.4/6.0 mmHg, and the largest mean pulse increase was 1.9 beats per min. No significant change in blood pressure and pulse was found in the second to sixth infusions compared with the first infusion. Patients who were older (age⩾50 years), hypertensive and receiving infusions while exhibiting dissociative symptoms showed greater maximal changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure than patients who were younger (age<50 years), normotensive and without dissociative symptoms (all p < 0.05). Hypertensive patients had less elevation of pulse than normotensive patients (p < 0.05).

Depressive, psychotomimetic and dissociative symptom severity was assessed at baseline and 4 hours after each infusion. RESULTS: The maximum blood pressure and pulse values were observed at 30-40 min during infusions. The largest mean systolic/diastolic blood pressure increases were 7.4/6.0 mmHg, and the largest mean pulse increase was 1.9 beats per min. No significant change in blood pressure and pulse was found in the second to sixth infusions compared with the first infusion. Patients who were older (age⩾50 years), hypertensive and receiving infusions while exhibiting dissociative symptoms showed greater maximal changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure than patients who were younger (age<50 years), normotensive and without dissociative symptoms (all p < 0.05). Hypertensive patients had less elevation of pulse than normotensive patients (p < 0.05). Ketamine <span class=""dosage"">dosage</span> was positively correlated with changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Blood pressure and pulse elevations following subanaesthetic ketamine infusions are transient and do not cause serious cardiovascular events. Older age, hypertension, large ketamine <span class=""dosage"">dosage</span> and dissociative symptoms may predict increased ketamine-induced cardiovascular effects.</p>

8746,"Antisuicidal Response Following Ketamine Infusion Is Associated With Decreased Nighttime Wakefulness in Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar Disorder.^
OBJECTIVE: Insomnia and disrupted sleep are associated with increased risk of suicide. The N-methyl-d-aspartate antagonist ketamine has been associated with reduced suicidal thoughts, but the mechanism of action is unknown. This study sought to evaluate differences in nocturnal wakefulness in depressed individuals who did and did not have an antisuicidal response to ketamine. METHODS: Thirty-four participants with baseline suicidal ideation diagnosed with either DSM-IV major depressive disorder (n = 23) or bipolar depression (n = 11) between 2006 and 2013 completed nighttime electroencephalography (EEG) the night before and the night after a single ketamine infusion (0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes). Suicidal ideation was assessed at baseline and the morning after ketamine infusion via several measures, including the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale suicide item, the suicide item of the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and the first 5 items of the Scale for Suicide Ideation. A generalized linear mixed model evaluated differences in nocturnal wakefulness, as verified by EEG, between those who had an antisuicidal response to ketamine and those who did not, controlling for baseline nocturnal wakefulness. Results were also compared to the sleep of healthy controls (n = 22). RESULTS: After analyses adjusted for baseline sleep, participants with an antisuicidal response to ketamine showed significantly reduced nocturnal wakefulness the night after ketamine infusion compared to those without an antisuicidal response (F₁,₂₂ = 5.04, P = .04). Level of nocturnal wakefulness after antisuicidal response to ketamine did not differ significantly from nocturnal wakefulness in the control sample but did differ at a trend level (F₁,₄₀ = 3.15, P = .08). CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in wakefulness following ketamine may point to a biological mechanism underlying the effect of ketamine on suicidal ideation.

2048,"Investigating the role of serotonin in visual orientation processing using an 'ecstasy' (MDMA)-based research model.^
Aims/Objectives:A growing body of evidence suggests that regular 'ecstasy' (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) use causes lasting changes to central serotonergic functioning in humans, including in the occipital lobe. Serotonin may play a role in visual orientation processing, mediated in the occipital lobe, via lateral inhibition. The tilt aftereffect is an illusion apparent following adaptation to stimuli angled 5-50° from vertical and thought to be affected by lateral inhibition between occipital neurons. A recent study identified an enhanced tilt aftereffect among ecstasy users, but only in a subset that were recently abstinent from amphetamines. The current study examined the effects of ecstasy use, cannabis use and their interacting effect on the magnitude of the tilt aftereffect among participants with no recent history of amphetamine consumption. Materials and Methods: Eleven ecstasy users, 15 cannabis users, 15 ecstasy plus cannabis users and 15 drug-naïve controls were compared on the magnitude of the tilt aftereffect elicited following adaptation to stimuli angled 15, 30, 40 or 60° from vertical. Results:At a 40° adaptation condition, ecstasy users had a greater magnitude of the tilt aftereffect compared to those that had not taken the drug. Additionally, the extent of ecstasy use was positively associated with the magnitude of the tilt aftereffect generated following 15, 30 and 40° adaptation conditions, but not at 60°.

5794,"Neural correlates of the severity of cocaine, heroin, alcohol, MDMA and cannabis use in polysubstance abusers: A resting-PET brain metabolism study.^
Introduction: Functional imaging studies of addiction following protracted abstinence have not been systematically conducted to look at the associations between severity of use of different drugs and brain dysfunction. Findings from such studies may be relevant to implement specific interventions for treatment. The aim of this study was to examine the association between resting-state regional brain metabolism (measured with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) and the severity of use of cocaine, heroin, alcohol, MDMA and cannabis in a sample of polysubstance users with prolonged abstinence from all drugs used. Methods: Our sample consisted of 49 polysubstance users enrolled in residential treatment. We conducted correlation analyses between estimates of use of cocaine, heroin, alcohol, MDMA and cannabis and brain metabolism (BM) (using Statistical Parametric Mapping voxel-based (VB) whole-brain analyses). In all correlation analyses conducted for each of the drugs we controlled for the co-abuse of the other drugs used. Results: The analysis showed significant negative correlations between severity of heroin, alcohol, MDMA and cannabis use and BM in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and temporal cortex. Alcohol use was further associated with lower metabolism in frontal premotor cortex and putamen, and stimulants use with parietal cortex. Conclusions: Duration of use of different drugs negatively correlated with overlapping regions in the DLPFC, whereas severity of cocaine, heroin and alcohol use selectively impact parietal, temporal, and frontal-premotor/basal ganglia regions respectively. The knowledge of these associations could be useful in the clinical practice since different brain alterations have been associated with different patterns of execution that may affect the rehabilitation of these patients. © 2012 Moreno-López et al.","###Task

INPUT: Neural correlates of the severity of cocaine, heroin, alcohol, MDMA and cannabis use in polysubstance abusers: A resting-PET brain metabolism study.^
Introduction: Functional imaging studies of addiction following protracted abstinence have not been systematically conducted to look at the associations between severity of use of different drugs and brain dysfunction. Findings from such studies may be relevant to implement specific interventions for treatment. The aim of this study was to examine the association between resting-state regional brain metabolism (measured with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) and the severity of use of cocaine, heroin, alcohol, MDMA and cannabis in a sample of polysubstance users with prolonged abstinence from all drugs used. Methods: Our sample consisted of 49 polysubstance users enrolled in residential treatment. We conducted correlation analyses between estimates of use of cocaine, heroin, alcohol, MDMA and cannabis and brain metabolism (BM) (using Statistical Parametric Mapping voxel-based (VB) whole-brain analyses). In all correlation analyses conducted for each of the drugs we controlled for the co-abuse of the other drugs used. Results: The analysis showed significant negative correlations between severity of heroin, alcohol, MDMA and cannabis use and BM in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and temporal cortex. Alcohol use was further associated with lower metabolism in frontal premotor cortex and putamen, and stimulants use with parietal cortex. Conclusions: Duration of use of different drugs negatively correlated with overlapping regions in the DLPFC, whereas severity of cocaine, heroin and alcohol use selectively impact parietal, temporal, and frontal-premotor/basal ganglia regions respectively. The knowledge of these associations could be useful in the clinical practice since different brain alterations have been associated with different patterns of execution that may affect the rehabilitation of these patients. © 2012 Moreno-López et al.

5346,"Real-world experience of esketamine use to manage treatment-resistant depression: A multicentric study on safety and effectiveness (REAL-ESK study).^
BACKGROUND: Treatment-resistant Depression (TRD) represents a widespread disorder with significant direct and indirect healthcare costs. esketamine, the S-enantiomer of ketamine, has been recently approved for TRD, but real-world studies are needed to prove its efficacy in naturalistic settings. OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the effectiveness and safety of esketamine nasal spray in a clinical sample of patients with TRD from several Italian mental health services. METHODS: REAL-ESK study is an observational, retrospective and multicentric study comprising a total of 116 TRD patients treated with esketamine nasal spray. Anamnestic data and psychometric assessment (MADRS, HAMD-21, HAM-A) were collected from medical records at baseline (T0), one month (T1) and three month (T2) follow-ups. RESULTS: A significant reduction of depressive symptoms was found at T1 and T2 compared to T0. A dramatic increase in clinical response (64.2 %) and remission rates (40.6 %) was detected at T2 compared to T1. No unexpected safety concerns were observed, side effects rates were comparable to those reported in RCTs. No differences in efficacy have been found among patients with and without psychiatric comorbidities. LIMITATIONS: The open design of the study and the absence of a placebo or active comparator group are limitations. The study lacks an inter-rater reliability evaluation of the assessments among the different centres. Side effects evaluation did not involve any specific scale. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the safety and tolerability of esketamine in a real-world TRD sample.

4587,"Psychedelic experience dose-dependently modulated by cannabis: Results of a prospective online survey.^
Rationale: Classic psychedelics are currently being studied as novel treatments for a range of psychiatric disorders. However, research on how psychedelics interact with other psychoactive substances remains scarce. Objectives: The current study aimed to explore the subjective effects of psychedelics when used alongside cannabis. Methods: Participants (n = 321) completed a set of online surveys at 2 time points: 7 days before, and 1 day after a planned experience with a serotonergic psychedelic. The collected data included demographics, environmental factors (so-called setting) and five validated questionnaires: Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ), visual subscales of Altered States of Consciousness Questionnaire (ASC-Vis), Challenging Experience Questionnaire (CEQ), Ego Dissolution Inventory (EDI) and Emotional Breakthrough Inventory (EBI). Participants were grouped according to whether they had reported using no cannabis (n = 195) or low (n = 53), medium (n = 45) or high (n = 28) dose, directly concomitant with the psychedelic. Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) and contrasts was used to analyse differences in subjective effects between groups while controlling for potential confounding contextual ‘setting’ variables. Results: The simultaneous use of cannabis together with classic serotonergic psychedelics was associated with more intense psychedelic experience across a range of measures: a linear relationship was found between dose and MEQ, ASC-Vis and EDI scores, while a quadratic relationship was found for CEQ scores. No relationship was found between the dose of cannabis and the EBI.

2035,"Ketamine infusions for treatment resistant depression: a series of 28 patients treated weekly or twice weekly in an ECT clinic.^
BACKGROUND: Ketamine has a rapid antidepressant effect in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The effects on cognitive function of multiple ketamine infusions and of concurrent antidepressant medication on response rate and duration are not known. METHOD: Twenty-eight patients with uni- or bipolar TRD were treated over three weeks with either three or six ketamine infusions (0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes) in the recovery room of a routine ECT clinic. Post-treatment memory assessments were conducted on day 21 (4-7 days after the final infusion). Patients were followed up for six months where possible, with severity of depression and side effects monitored throughout. RESULTS: Eight (29%) patients responded of whom four remitted. Only three (11%) patients had responded within six hours after a single infusion, but in all responders, the response had developed before the third infusion. The duration of response from the final infusion was variable (median 70, range 25-168 days). Discontinuations included two (7%) because of acute adverse reactions during the infusion and five (18%) because of failure to benefit and increasing anxiety. Ketamine was not associated with memory impairment. The ECT clinic was rated suitable by patients and offered appropriate levels of monitoring. CONCLUSION: This small, open label naturalistic study shows that up to six low dose ketamine infusions can safely be given within an existing NHS clinical structure to patients who continue their antidepressants. The response rate was comparable to that found in RCTs of single doses of ketamine in antidepressant-free patients but took slightly longer to develop.","###Task

METHOD: Twenty-eight patients with uni- or bipolar TRD were treated over three weeks with either three or six ketamine infusions (0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes) in the recovery room of a routine ECT clinic. Post-treatment memory assessments were conducted on day 21 (4-7 days after the final infusion). Patients were followed up for six months where possible, with severity of depression and side effects monitored throughout. RESULTS: Eight (29%) patients responded of whom four remitted. Only three (11%) patients had responded within six hours after a single infusion, but in all responders, the response had developed before the third infusion. The duration of response from the final infusion was variable (median 70, range 25-168 days). Discontinuations included two (7%) because of acute adverse reactions during the infusion and five (18%) because of failure to benefit and increasing anxiety. Ketamine was not associated with memory impairment. The ECT clinic was rated suitable by patients and offered appropriate levels of monitoring. CONCLUSION: This small, open label naturalistic study shows that up to six low dose ketamine infusions can safely be given within an existing NHS clinical structure to patients who continue their antidepressants. The response rate was comparable to that found in RCTs of single doses of ketamine in antidepressant-free patients but took slightly longer to develop.

4841,"Ninety-six hour ketamine infusion with co-administered clonidine for treatment-resistant depression: A pilot randomised controlled trial.^
Objectives We examined the feasibility of a high-dose, 96-h infusion of ketamine in treatment-resistant depression. Methods Ten participants were randomised to receive a 96-h ketamine infusion, titrated as tolerated to a target rate of 0.6 mg/kg/h, while 10 received a 40-min ketamine infusion (0.5 mg/kg). Both groups received clonidine, titrated to a maximum of 0.6 mg orally daily, during the infusion to mitigate side effects of ketamine. Participants were followed for 8 weeks to examine potential antidepressant effects. Results All 20 participants completed the infusion. Most participants tolerated the infusion well, with minimal psychotomimetic symptoms or blood pressure elevation despite achieving high ketamine concentrations (mean 424 ng/ml for 96-h arm, 156 ng/ml for 40-min arm). There was no rebound hypertension upon discontinuing clonidine. Rapid and sustained improvement in depressive symptoms was observed in both study groups. Higher ketamine concentration was associated with sustained antidepressant response, and was not with greater psychotomimetic side effects, in the 96-h arm. Conclusions This study provides evidence for the feasibility of prolonged ketamine infusions in treatment-resistant depression. Co-administration of clonidine appeared to mitigate ketamine's psychotomimetic effects. Further study is required to investigate the extent to which prolonged ketamine infusions could provide both rapid and sustained improvements in treatment-resistant depression.

Aims: Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is currently investigated for several neurological and psychiatric illnesses. Various studies have investigated the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic relationship of LSD in healthy participants, but data on urinary recovery and confirmatory studies are missing. Methods: The present study characterized the pharmacokinetics, pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic relationship and urinary recovery of LSD at doses of 85 and 170 μg administered orally in 28 healthy participants. The plasma concentrations and subjective effects of LSD were continuously evaluated over a period of 24 h. Urine was collected during 3 time intervals (0–8, 8–16 and 16–24 h after LSD administration). Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using compartmental modelling. Concentration–subjective effect relationships were described using pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic modelling. Results: Mean (95% confidence interval) maximal LSD concentrations were 1.8 ng/mL (1.6–2.0) and 3.4 ng/mL (3.0–3.8) after the administration of 85 and 170 μg LSD, respectively. Maximal concentrations were achieved on average after 1.7 h. Elimination half-lives were 3.7 h (3.4–4.1) and 4.0 h (3.6–4.4), for 85 and 170 μg LSD, respectively. Only 1% of the administered dose was recovered from urine unchanged within the first 24 h, 16% was eliminated as 2-oxo-3-hydroxy-LSD. Urinary recovery was dose proportional. Mean (±standard deviation) durations of subjective effects were 9.3 ± 3.2 and 11 ± 3.7 h, and maximal effects (any drug effects) were 77 ± 18% and 87 ± 13% after 85 and 170 μg of LSD, respectively.

1395,"Effect of ecstasy [3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)] on cerebral blood flow: A co-registered SPECT and MRI study.^
3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), an illicit recreational drug, damages serotonergic nerve endings. Since the cerebrovasculature is regulated partly by the serotonergic system, MDMA may affect cerebral blood flow (CBF) in humans. We evaluated 21 abstinent recreational MDMA users and 21 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects with brain SPECT and MRI. Ten of the MDMA subjects also had repeat SPECT and MRI after receiving two doses of MDMA. Abstinent MDMA users showed no significantly different global or regional CBF (rCBF) compared to the control subjects. However, within 3 weeks after MDMA administration, rCBF remained decreased in the visual cortex, the caudate, the superior parietal and dorsolateral frontal regions compared to baseline rCBF. The decreased rCBF tended to be more pronounced in subjects who received the higher dosage of MDMA. Two subjects who were scanned at 2-3 months after MDMA administration showed increased rather than decreased rCBF. Low-dose recreational MDMA use does not cause detectable persistent rCBF changes in humans. The lack of long-term rCBF changes may be due to a non-significant effect of serotonergic deficits on rCBF, or regeneration of serotonergic nerve terminals. The subacute decrease in rCBF after MDMA administration may be due to the direct effect of MDMA on the serotonergic system or the indirect effects of its metabolites on the dopaminergic system; the preliminary data suggest these effects may be transient.

INPUT: Effect of ecstasy [3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)] on cerebral blood flow: A co-registered SPECT and MRI study.^
3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), an illicit recreational drug, damages serotonergic nerve endings. Since the cerebrovasculature is regulated partly by the serotonergic system, MDMA may affect cerebral blood flow (CBF) in humans. We evaluated 21 abstinent recreational MDMA users and 21 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects with brain SPECT and MRI. Ten of the MDMA subjects also had repeat SPECT and MRI after receiving two doses of MDMA. Abstinent MDMA users showed no significantly different global or regional CBF (rCBF) compared to the control subjects. However, within 3 weeks after MDMA administration, rCBF remained decreased in the visual cortex, the caudate, the superior parietal and dorsolateral frontal regions compared to baseline rCBF.

6035,"Randomized, Double-blind, Active-placebo Controlled Study of MDMA-assisted Psychotherapy in People With Chronic PTSD.^
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating disorder that develops after people undergo a traumatic event, such as a rape, car accident or other life‐threatening event. PTSD is a worldwide health problem. Psychotherapy or drugs are used to treat PTSD, but there is an interest in developing other treatment options. 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)‐assisted psychotherapy is one potential treatment. MDMA is known as the active ingredient in ""ecstasy."" It was used along with psychotherapy to treat people in the past, and a study suggests that MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy might help people with PTSD. This Phase 2 research study will investigate the safety and efficacy of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy in 10 people with chronic, treatment‐resistant posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). After open‐label lead‐in in two subjects there will be a randomized, double‐blind arm comparing 125 vs. 25 mg MDMA in eight participants, and an open‐label arm for participants who received active placebo. In this study, five people will be randomly assigned to receive the full dose of 125 and 62.5 mg MDMA and three will be randomized to receive the active placebo dose of 25 and 125. mg MDMA. MDMA will be administered during two six to eight hour long experimental sessions scheduled three to five weeks apart. Study subjects will have a medical and psychiatric examination and a measure of their PTSD symptoms to make sure they meet the criteria to be in the study. Subjects must be in good physical health. They will also complete questionnaires about their PTSD symptoms, symptoms of depression and sleep quality. These tests will be given by a researcher who will not be present during any of the therapy sessions. This same researcher will give the subject the same tests or measures two months after the second experimental session and 12 months after a final experimental session. Once enrolled, subjects will have three preparatory sessions with a team of two therapists, one male and one female. The same team of therapists will work with them throughout the entire study. The subject will learn more about MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy and the therapists will learn more about the subject's goals, hopes and fears. Starting from the second preparatory session, subjects will answer questions on thoughts about hurting or killing themselves; these questions will be asked during face to face contact this and on two of the contact days, which may occur over the telephone. Subjects will have to stop taking their psychiatric medication before they have their first experimental session, with exact times dependent upon the specific medications involved. Subjects and the therapists, but not the person measuring symptoms, will find out if the subject had the active placebo or full dose of MDMA at this time, and if the subject had the active placebo, they can start the second arm of the study. What happens during this arm is very similar to the arm except that the subject and therapists will know the subject is getting a full dose of MDMA. Twelve months after the subject's final follow‐up visit (two months after their final experimental session), PTSD symptoms, symptoms of depression and sleep quality will be assessed again, and subjects will complete an additional questionnaire about their experiences during and after the study. The study will compare PTSD symptoms before and after MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy with a full dose and therapy with an active placebo dose of MDMA. Both therapists will be present for each experimental session. During experimental sessions, subjects will be encouraged to confront trauma‐related thoughts, feelings and memories. Blood pressure, heart rate (pulse) and body temperature will be measured regularly, and the researchers will periodically ask the subject to rate his or her degree of distress. Subjects will stay overnight at the clinic and have their first integrative session, where they will examine what happened during their experimental session. They will have two more integrative ses ions until they have their next experimental session. Subjects will fill out a questionnaire on their PTSD symptoms on every third integrative session. Two months after the second experimental session, subjects will answer questions or complete questionnaires about PTSD symptoms, symptoms of depression and sleep quality, and one of the researchers will assess their general psychological function.","###Task

3962,"Incidental use of ecstasy: no evidence for harmful effects on cognitive brain function in a prospective fMRI study.^
RATIONALE: Heavy ecstasy use in humans has been associated with cognitive impairments and changes in cognitive brain function supposedly due to damage to the serotonin system. There is concern that even a single dose of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine may be neurotoxic, but very little is known about the consequences of a low dose of ecstasy for cognitive brain function. OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to assess the effects of a low dose of ecstasy on human cognitive brain function using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). MATERIALS AND METHOD: We prospectively studied, as part of the NeXT (Netherlands XTC toxicity) study, sustained effects of a low dose of ecstasy on brain function in 25 subjects before and after their first episode of ecstasy use (mean 2.0 +/- 1.4 ecstasy pills, on average 11.1 +/- 12.9 weeks since last ecstasy use), compared to 24 persistent ecstasy-naive controls, also measured twice and matched with the novice users on age, gender, IQ, and cannabis use. Cognitive brain function was measured in the domains of working memory, selective attention, and associative memory using fMRI. RESULTS: No significant effects were found of a low dose of ecstasy on working memory, selective attention, or associative memory neither at the behavioral level nor at the neurophysiological level.

Your task is to generate an HTML version of an input text, marking up specific entities. The entities to be identified are: Application area, Dosage. Use HTML <span> tags to highlight these entities. Each <span> should have a class attribute indicating the type of entity.

###Entity Markup Guide
Use <span class=""application-area""> to denote Application area, <span class=""dosage""> to denote Dosage.

###Entity Defintions
Application area is defined as: The condition or disease of interest studied under the impact of the psychedelic substance in the present paper.

Dosage is defined as: The applied dosage(s) of the psychedelic substance(s) in the present study.

###Annotation Guidelines
Application area should be annotated according to the following criteria:
* Our working definition for the Application is any ""state labeled as diseases by virtue of consensus on prevalent sociocultural and medical values"". It has to have ""clearly identifiable diagnostic features and disease progression, and response to specific treatment.""
* As a general guideline, annotated entities should be conditions that have an ICD-10/11 code.
* Annotate only in title and/or the introductory part of the abstract, i.e., when the problem or objective of the study is discussed (including abbreviations). Do NOT annotate outcomes, such as ""the Hamilton Depression Scale"" should not be annotated. Similarly, ""antisuicidal response"" should not be annotated. Or: ""among participants, depression was reduced"", do NOT annotate depression.
* Do NOT annotate antidepressant.
* Do not annotate over brackets: ""…or bipolar disorder (BD) type 1 and type 2"", only bipolar disorder and BD should be annotated as two entities.
* Do NOT annotate very generic concepts like ""psychiatric condition""
* Annotate sweeping statements like ""…with major depressive and bipolar disorder"" as one entity.
* Annotate the reasonably necessary string, e.g., ""active suicidal ideation"", active suicidal ideation should be annotated. However, adjectives could be annotated, ""Depressed patients"", annotate Depressed but not patients. ""depressive symptoms"" should both be annotated (also symptoms of depression). In ""refractory anxiety disorder"", annotate the entire string.
* Further defining characteristics should be included: Acute/Chronic; Active/Inactive; Mild/Moderate/Severe; End Stage/Early Stage; Drug-resistant; Total/Partial; Intermittent/Relapsing and others. Similarly, ""Post-stroke"" should be annotated instead of only ""stroke"" because it refers to the phase after the acute stroke.
* Annotate abbreviations. Abbreviations should be annotated  separately. For instance,""Huntington disease (HD)""should be separated into two annotations: ""Huntington disease"" and ""HD.
* Of note, in ""Managing dissociative symptoms following esketamine"", dissociative symptoms are NOT the treatment target but the target of the study and should NOT be annotated (context is relevant).
* Cigarette addiction is a disorder but not smoking cessation.
* Can be empty, i.e., no annotation per abstract.
* Include .^ in the title for highlighting

Dosage should be annotated according to the following criteria:
* Only annotate for studies testing not more than 1 psychedelic substance (e.g., do not annotate in a study testing lsd and psilocybin, BUT annotate in a study testing psilocybin against midazolam)
* Do NOT annotate doses of other substances or of the psychedelic substance in other studies (e.g, mentioned by referencing other studies)
* Do not annotate concentrations of solutions but dosages, i.e., do NOT annotate 500mg/10 ml, but annotate 2mg/kg.
* Annotate the number and the corresponding unit.
* Annotate all reported doses for the respective psychedelic substance.
* Annotate only for single substance studies (i.e., do not annotate in abstracts which report the dosage of two or more psychedelic substances).
* Annotate the number including the unit.
* Annotate also the term ""between"" if pertinent, similarly ""or"" and ""and"" should be annotated. Do not annotate ""per device"".
* Annotate also relative dosages (e.g., 1 mg/kg), do not annotate the terms ""bw"" or ""body weight"" or similar if pertinent

8878,"Genetic influence of CYP2D6 on pharmacokinetics and acute subjective effects of LSD in a pooled analysis.^
Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a classic psychedelic substance that is used recreationally and investigated in psychiatric research. There are no pharmacogenetic studies on LSD. In vitro metabolic studies indicate that several cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms (e.g., CYP2D6, CYP1A2, and CYP2C9) are involved in LSD metabolism, but in vivo data are scarce. The present study examined the influence of genetic polymorphisms of CYP genes on the pharmacokinetics and acute effects of LSD in healthy subjects. We identified common genetic variants of CYPs (CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2B6) in 81 healthy subjects who were pooled from four randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 1 studies. We found that genetically determined CYP2D6 functionality significantly influenced the pharmacokinetics of LSD. Individuals with no functional CYP2D6 (i.e., poor metabolizers) had longer LSD half-lives and approximately 75% higher parent drug and main metabolite 2-oxo-3-hydroxy LSD area-under-the-curve blood plasma concentrations compared with carriers of functional CYP2D6. Non-functional CYP2D6 metabolizers also exhibited greater alterations of mind and longer subjective effect durations in response to LSD compared with functional CYP2D6 metabolizers. No effect on the pharmacokinetics or acute effects of LSD were observed with other CYPs. These findings indicate that genetic polymorphisms of CYP2D6 significantly influence the pharmacokinetic and subjective effects of LSD.

1037,"Alcohol use and risk taking among regular ecstasy users.^
We examine alcohol use in conjunction with ecstasy use and risk-taking behaviors among regular ecstasy users in every capital city in Australia. Data on drug use and risks were collected in 2004 from a national sample of 852 regular ecstasy users (persons who had used ecstasy at least monthly in the preceding 6 months). Users were grouped according to their typical alcohol use when using ecstasy: no use, consumption of between one and five standard drinks, and consumption of more than five drinks (""binge"" alcohol use). The sample was young, well educated, and mainly working or studying. Approximately two thirds (65%) of the regular ecstasy users reported drinking alcohol when taking ecstasy. Of these, 69% reported usually consuming more than five standard drinks. Those who did not drink alcohol were more disadvantaged, with greater levels of unemployment, less education, higher rates of drug user treatment, and prison history. They were also more likely than those who drank alcohol when using ecstasy to be drug injectors and to be hepatitis C positive. Excluding alcohol, drug use patterns were similar between groups, although the no alcohol group used cannabis and methamphetamine more frequently. Binge drinkers were more likely to report having had three or more sexual partners in the past 6 months and were less likely to report having safe sex with casual partners while under the influence of drugs. Despite some evidence that the no alcohol group were more entrenched drug users, those who typically drank alcohol when taking ecstasy were as likely to report risks and problems associated with their drug use. It appears that regular ecstasy users who binge drink are placing themselves at increased sexual risk when under the influence of drugs. Safe sex messages should address the sexual risk associated with substance use and should be tailored to reducing alcohol consumption, particularly targeting ""heavy"" alcohol users. The study's limitations are noted. Copyright © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","###Task

INPUT: Alcohol use and risk taking among regular ecstasy users.^
We examine alcohol use in conjunction with ecstasy use and risk-taking behaviors among regular ecstasy users in every capital city in Australia. Data on drug use and risks were collected in 2004 from a national sample of 852 regular ecstasy users (persons who had used ecstasy at least monthly in the preceding 6 months). Users were grouped according to their typical alcohol use when using ecstasy: no use, consumption of between one and five standard drinks, and consumption of more than five drinks (""binge"" alcohol use). The sample was young, well educated, and mainly working or studying. Approximately two thirds (65%) of the regular ecstasy users reported drinking alcohol when taking ecstasy. Of these, 69% reported usually consuming more than five standard drinks. Those who did not drink alcohol were more disadvantaged, with greater levels of unemployment, less education, higher rates of drug user treatment, and prison history. They were also more likely than those who drank alcohol when using ecstasy to be drug injectors and to be hepatitis C positive. Excluding alcohol, drug use patterns were similar between groups, although the no alcohol group used cannabis and methamphetamine more frequently. Binge drinkers were more likely to report having had three or more sexual partners in the past 6 months and were less likely to report having safe sex with casual partners while under the influence of drugs. Despite some evidence that the no alcohol group were more entrenched drug users, those who typically drank alcohol when taking ecstasy were as likely to report risks and problems associated with their drug use. It appears that regular ecstasy users who binge drink are placing themselves at increased sexual risk when under the influence of drugs. Safe sex messages should address the sexual risk associated with substance use and should be tailored to reducing alcohol consumption, particularly targeting ""heavy"" alcohol users. The study's limitations are noted. Copyright © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

###Entity Markup Guide
Use <span class=""application-area""> to denote Application area, <span class=""dosage""> to denote Dosage.

###Entity Defintions
Application area is defined as: The condition or disease of interest studied under the impact of the psychedelic substance in the present paper.

Dosage is defined as: The applied dosage(s) of the psychedelic substance(s) in the present study.

###Annotation Guidelines
Application area should be annotated according to the following criteria:
* Our working definition for the Application is any ""state labeled as diseases by virtue of consensus on prevalent sociocultural and medical values"". It has to have ""clearly identifiable diagnostic features and disease progression, and response to specific treatment.""
* As a general guideline, annotated entities should be conditions that have an ICD-10/11 code.
* Annotate only in title and/or the introductory part of the abstract, i.e., when the problem or objective of the study is discussed (including abbreviations). Do NOT annotate outcomes, such as ""the Hamilton Depression Scale"" should not be annotated. Similarly, ""antisuicidal response"" should not be annotated. Or: ""among participants, depression was reduced"", do NOT annotate depression.

1255,"Double-blind comparison of the two hallucinogens psilocybin and dextromethorphan: similarities and differences in subjective experiences.^
RATIONALE: Although psilocybin and dextromethorphan (DXM) are hallucinogens, they have different receptor mechanisms of action and have not been directly compared. OBJECTIVE: This study compared subjective, behavioral, and physiological effects of psilocybin and dextromethorphan under conditions that minimized expectancy effects. METHODS: Single, acute oral doses of psilocybin (10, 20, 30 mg/70 kg), DXM (400 mg/70 kg), and placebo were administered under double-blind conditions to 20 healthy participants with histories of hallucinogen use. Instructions to participants and staff minimized expectancy effects. Various subjective, behavioral, and physiological effects were assessed after drug administration. RESULTS: High doses of both drugs produced similar increases in participant ratings of peak overall drug effect strength, with similar times to maximal effect and time-course. Psilocybin produced orderly dose-related increases on most participant-rated subjective measures previously shown sensitive to hallucinogens. DXM produced increases on most of these same measures. However, the high dose of psilocybin produced significantly greater and more diverse visual effects than DXM including greater movement and more frequent, brighter, distinctive, and complex (including textured and kaleidoscopic) images and visions. Compared to DXM, psilocybin also produced significantly greater mystical-type and psychologically insightful experiences and greater absorption in music. In contrast, DXM produced larger effects than psilocybin on measures of disembodiment, nausea/emesis, and light-headedness. Both drugs increased systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and pupil dilation and decreased psychomotor performance and balance. CONCLUSIONS: Psilocybin and DXM produced similar profiles of subjective experiences, with psilocybin producing relatively greater visual, mystical-type, insightful, and musical experiences, and DXM producing greater disembodiment.","###Task

5246,"Cortical structural differences following repeated ayahuasca use hold molecular signatures.^
Introduction: Serotonergic psychedelics such as ayahuasca are reported to promote both structural and functional neural plasticity via partial 5-HT2A agonism. However, little is known about how these molecular mechanisms may extend to repeated psychedelic administration in humans, let alone neuroanatomy. While early evidence suggests localised changes to cortical thickness in long-term ayahuasca users, it is unknown how such findings may be reflected by large-scale anatomical brain networks comprising cytoarchitecturally complex regions. Methods: Here, we examined the relationship between cortical gene expression markers of psychedelic action and brain morphometric change following repeated ayahuasca usage, using high-field 7 Tesla neuroimaging data derived from 24 members of an ayahuasca-using church (Santo Daime) and case-matched controls. Results: Using a morphometric similarity network (MSN) analysis, repeated ayahuasca use was associated with a spatially distributed cortical patterning of both structural differentiation in sensorimotor areas and de-differentiation in transmodal areas. Cortical MSN remodelling was found to be spatially correlated with dysregulation of 5-HT2A gene expression as well as a broader set of genes encoding target receptors pertinent to ayahuasca’s effects. Furthermore, these associations were similarly interrelated with altered gene expression of specific transcriptional factors and immediate early genes previously identified in preclinical assays as relevant to psychedelic-induced neuroplasticity. Conclusion: Taken together, these findings provide preliminary evidence that the molecular mechanisms of psychedelic action may scale up to a macroscale level of brain organisation in vivo. Closer attention to the role of cortical transcriptomics in structural-functional coupling may help account for the behavioural differences observed in experienced psychedelic users.","###Task

5688,"MDMA-assisted therapy for severe PTSD: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study.^
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) presents a major public health problem for which currently available treatments are modestly effective. We report the findings of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-site phase 3 clinical trial (NCT03537014) to test the efficacy and safety of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted therapy for the treatment of patients with severe PTSD, including those with common comorbidities such as dissociation, depression, a history of alcohol and substance use disorders, and childhood trauma. After psychiatric medication washout, participants (n = 90) were randomized 1:1 to receive manualized therapy with MDMA or with placebo, combined with three preparatory and nine integrative therapy sessions. PTSD symptoms, measured with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5, the primary endpoint), and functional impairment, measured with the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS, the secondary endpoint) were assessed at baseline and at 2 months after the last experimental session. Adverse events and suicidality were tracked throughout the study. MDMA was found to induce significant and robust attenuation in CAPS-5 score compared with placebo (P < 0.0001, d = 0.91) and to significantly decrease the SDS total score (P = 0.0116, d = 0.43). The mean change in CAPS-5 scores in participants completing treatment was -24.4 (s.d. 11.6) in the MDMA group and -13.9 (s.d. 11.5) in the placebo group. MDMA did not induce adverse events of abuse potential, suicidality or QT prolongation. These data indicate that, compared with manualized therapy with inactive placebo, MDMA-assisted therapy is highly efficacious in individuals with severe PTSD, and treatment is safe and well-tolerated, even in those with comorbidities. We conclude that MDMA-assisted therapy represents a potential breakthrough treatment that merits expedited clinical evaluation.","###Task

INPUT: MDMA-assisted therapy for severe PTSD: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study.^
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) presents a major public health problem for which currently available treatments are modestly effective. We report the findings of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-site phase 3 clinical trial (NCT03537014) to test the efficacy and safety of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted therapy for the treatment of patients with severe PTSD, including those with common comorbidities such as dissociation, depression, a history of alcohol and substance use disorders, and childhood trauma. After psychiatric medication washout, participants (n = 90) were randomized 1:1 to receive manualized therapy with MDMA or with placebo, combined with three preparatory and nine integrative therapy sessions. PTSD symptoms, measured with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5, the primary endpoint), and functional impairment, measured with the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS, the secondary endpoint) were assessed at baseline and at 2 months after the last experimental session. Adverse events and suicidality were tracked throughout the study. MDMA was found to induce significant and robust attenuation in CAPS-5 score compared with placebo (P < 0.0001, d = 0.91) and to significantly decrease the SDS total score (P = 0.0116, d = 0.43). The mean change in CAPS-5 scores in participants completing treatment was -24.4 (s.d. 11.6) in the MDMA group and -13.9 (s.d. 11.5) in the placebo group. MDMA did not induce adverse events of abuse potential, suicidality or QT prolongation. These data indicate that, compared with manualized therapy with inactive placebo, MDMA-assisted therapy is highly efficacious in individuals with severe PTSD, and treatment is safe and well-tolerated, even in those with comorbidities. We conclude that MDMA-assisted therapy represents a potential breakthrough treatment that merits expedited clinical evaluation.

6228,"LSD Treatment for Persons With Alcohol Use Disorder.^
Alcohol use causes more overall harm than any other drug and is the seventh leading risk factor for both deaths and disability‐adjusted life years. Alcohol use disorders (AUD) are among the most common and undertreated mental disorders in developed countries. Pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments only show limited efficacy and around 60% of the patients relapse in short‐term after withdrawal. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) was extensively investigated in the 1950s and 1960s and became one of the best‐studied psychoactive substances with several thousands of early scientific reports. Specifically, the use of LSD in the treatment of AUD was investigated extensively. A pooled analysis of six historical clinical trials demonstrated, that a single dose of LSD significantly reduced alcohol use at three and six months after LSD administration and the improvements surpassed treatment with established psychopharmacological interventions. However, these historical studies do not meet today's methodological standards which limits the validity of these findings. Well‐designed studies are needed to further investigate this promising treatment approach. Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate safety and efficacy of LSD for the treatment of AUD. The trial has a double‐blind, active placebo‐controlled, randomized, parallel design and will be conducted in three specialized treatment centers for addictive disorders in Switzerland. The study will include 128 patients after withdrawal treatment and will primarily assess the efficacy of LSD for relapse prevention after standard detoxification. Patients will be treated using a 1:1 allocation. In the first session, patients in the treatment group will receive a dose of 150 µg LSD, followed by another 150 µg or 250 µg LSD in the second session, which will take place approximately 4 weeks after the first session. The primary outcome is the mean of percent heavy drinking days after administration of two doses of LSD at 3 months' follow‐up. Additionally, other alcohol associated parameters and associated common comorbidities as well as potential predictors and mediators for treatment response will be assessed.","###Task

Background: There are only a few studies investigating cognitive performance and personality structures in current und previous users of ecstasy. Still, these studies are necessary to examine the persistent effects of ecstasy use. Method: 30 current and 31 previous users of ecstasy with concomitant use of amphetamine, cannabis, cocaine and LSD and 24 pure cannabis users were compared on a battery of neuropsychological tests and on personality dimensions. Results: There were no significant group differences in all dimensions of the personality questionaire, the tasks of attention and psychomotor speed. Current and previous ecstasy users performed more poorly than cannabis users on tests of immediate and delayed recall. Conclusions: These alterations of cognitive performance could be explained as consequences of possible neurotoxic damage due to ecstasy use or combined drug use.

Background: 3,4‐Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ?ecstasy?) is widely used recreationally. However, MDMA is also being investigated as a new medication for the treatment of post‐traumatic stress disorder. This study was designed to characterize the subjective effects of MDMA in healthy volunteers. Methods: The present pooled analysis included data from nine randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, cross‐over studies in a total of 162 healthy subjects (82 females) receiving a single dose of 125 mg of MDMA. Outcome measures included the five Dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness scale (5D‐ASC) administered once after the drug effect, and a series of visual analogue scales (VASs) administered repeatedly during the drug effect to assess the area under the effect‐time curve (AUEC0‐6h). Outcome values are reported as differences from placebo (Δ). Sex differences were assessed after correcting for MDMA plasma concentration. Results: MDMA significantly increased the scores of all subscales on the 5D‐ASC. However, the effects of MDMA on the 5D‐ASC were rather small (Δ5D‐ASC total score, % mean±SD] 13±11; p<.001) with most distinct effects in the subscales blissful state and experience of unity (Δrating score, %mean±SD: 37±32 and 21±26, respectively; both p<.001).

<h1>At ease-subjective effects of <span class=""application-area"">post‐traumatic stress disorder</span> in placebo-controlled studies with healthy subjects.^</h1>
<p>Background: 3,4‐Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ?ecstasy?) is widely used recreationally. However, MDMA is also being investigated as a new medication for the treatment of <span class=""application-area"">post‐traumatic stress disorder</span>. This study was designed to characterize the subjective effects of MDMA in healthy volunteers. Methods: The present pooled analysis included data from nine randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, cross‐over studies in a total of 162 healthy subjects (82 females) receiving a single <span class=""dosage"">dose of 125 mg</span> of MDMA. Outcome measures included the five Dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness scale (5D‐ASC) administered once after the drug effect, and a series of visual analogue scales (VASs) administered repeatedly during the drug effect to assess the area under the effect‐time curve (AUEC0‐6h). Outcome values are reported as differences from placebo (Δ). Sex differences were assessed after correcting for MDMA plasma concentration. Results: MDMA significantly increased the scores of all subscales on the 5D‐ASC. However, the effects of MDMA on the 5D‐ASC were rather small (Δ5D‐ASC total score, % mean±SD] 13±11; p<.001) with most distinct effects in the subscales blissful state and experience of unity (Δrating score, %mean±SD: 37±32 and 21±26, respectively; both p<.001). MDMA acutely enhanced ratings of feelings of openness, talkative, trust, and closeness to others on the VASs (ΔAUEC0‐6h, %mean±SD: 95±136, 48±151, 118±135, and 71±123, respectively; all p<.001).

8972,"Use of plant-based hallucinogens and dissociative agents: U.S. Time Trends, 2002–2019.^
Aims: Information on time trends in use of different plant-based hallucinogens is lacking. The current study used nationally representative U.S. data to assess overall and age-specific time trends in the prevalence of lifetime and 12-month use of plant-based hallucinogens and dissociative agents. Methods: Participants were respondents aged ≥ 12 years (N = 1,006,051) from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2002–2019. Predictors were continuous years. Outcomes included illicit use of peyote, mescaline, psilocybin, ketamine, salvia, and tryptamine. Sociodemographic variables (gender; age; race/ethnicity; educational level; family income) were modeled as covariates. Trends were estimated overall and by age (12–17, 18–25, 26+). Prevalence differences [PDs] were obtained for each category, along with 95 % confidence intervals [CI]. Results: Increases in lifetime use were observed for psilocybin (2002–2019 PD=+1.61), tryptamine (2006–2014 PD=+0.55; 2015–2019 PD=+0.44), and ketamine (2006–2014 PD=+0.27; 2015–2019 PD=+0.21). Mescaline use decreased (PD = −0.89). While overall lifetime salvia use increased between 2006 and 2014 (PD=+1.81), prevalence did not change between 2015 and 2019. Twelve-month use of tryptamine and ketamine increased between 2006 and 2014 (PD=+0.14; +0.03, respectively). Twelve-month ketamine use also increased from 2015 to 2019 (PD=+0.03). By age, participants aged 12–17 and 18–25 showed decreases in use of most types of hallucinogens, but those age 26+ generally showed increases. Conclusions: While use of plant-based hallucinogens and dissociative agents remains rare, lifetime use of ketamine, tryptamine, and psilocybin is increasing in adults. Considering these increases alongside concerns about unsupervised use of illicit products whose dose and composition is uncertain, clinicians and policymakers should remain mindful of the rising rates of illicit use in the general population.","###Task

Your task is to generate an HTML version of an input text, marking up specific entities. The entities to be identified are: Application area, Dosage. Use HTML <span> tags to highlight these entities. Each <span> should have a class attribute indicating the type of entity.

###Entity Markup Guide
Use <span class=""application-area""> to denote Application area, <span class=""dosage""> to denote Dosage.

###Entity Defintions
Application area is defined as: The condition or disease of interest studied under the impact of the psychedelic substance in the present paper.

Dosage is defined as: The applied dosage(s) of the psychedelic substance(s) in the present study.

###Annotation Guidelines
Application area should be annotated according to the following criteria:
* Our working definition for the Application is any ""state labeled as diseases by virtue of consensus on prevalent sociocultural and medical values"". It has to have ""clearly identifiable diagnostic features and disease progression, and response to specific treatment.""
* As a general guideline, annotated entities should be conditions that have an ICD-10/11 code.
* Annotate only in title and/or the introductory part of the abstract, i.e., when the problem or objective of the study is discussed (including abbreviations). Do NOT annotate outcomes, such as ""the Hamilton Depression Scale"" should not be annotated. Similarly, ""antisuicidal response"" should not be annotated. Or: ""among participants, depression was reduced"", do NOT annotate depression.
* Do NOT annotate antidepressant.
* Do not annotate over brackets: ""…or bipolar disorder (BD) type 1 and type 2"", only bipolar disorder and BD should be annotated as two entities.
* Do NOT annotate very generic concepts like ""psychiatric condition""
* Annotate sweeping statements like ""…with major depressive and bipolar disorder"" as one entity.
* Annotate the reasonably necessary string, e.g., ""active suicidal ideation"", active suicidal ideation should be annotated. However, adjectives could be annotated, ""Depressed patients"", annotate Depressed but not patients. ""depressive symptoms"" should both be annotated (also symptoms of depression). In ""refractory anxiety disorder"", annotate the entire string.
* Further defining characteristics should be included: Acute/Chronic; Active/Inactive; Mild/Moderate/Severe; End Stage/Early Stage; Drug-resistant; Total/Partial; Intermittent/Relapsing and others. Similarly, ""Post-stroke"" should be annotated instead of only ""stroke"" because it refers to the phase after the acute stroke.
* Annotate abbreviations. Abbreviations should be annotated  separately. For instance,""Huntington disease (HD)""should be separated into two annotations: ""Huntington disease"" and ""HD.
* Of note, in ""Managing dissociative symptoms following esketamine"", dissociative symptoms are NOT the treatment target but the target of the study and should NOT be annotated (context is relevant).
* Cigarette addiction is a disorder but not smoking cessation.
* Can be empty, i.e., no annotation per abstract.
* Include .^ in the title for highlighting

Dosage should be annotated according to the following criteria:
* Only annotate for studies testing not more than 1 psychedelic substance (e.g., do not annotate in a study testing lsd and psilocybin, BUT annotate in a study testing psilocybin against midazolam)
* Do NOT annotate doses of other substances or of the psychedelic substance in other studies (e.g, mentioned by referencing other studies)
* Do not annotate concentrations of solutions but dosages, i.e., do NOT annotate 500mg/10 ml, but annotate 2mg/kg.
* Annotate the number and the corresponding unit.
* Annotate all reported doses for the respective psychedelic substance.
* Annotate only for single substance studies (i.e., do not annotate in abstracts which report the dosage of two or more psychedelic substances).
* Annotate the number including the unit.
* Annotate also the term ""between"" if pertinent, similarly ""or"" and ""and"" should be annotated. Do not annotate ""per device"".
* Annotate also relative dosages (e.g., 1 mg/kg), do not annotate the terms ""bw"" or ""body weight"" or similar if pertinent
* Do NOT annotate doses measured in e.g., plasma (like 4 mg/ml)
* Can be empty, i.e, no annotation per abstract.

Research on the clinical applications of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy has demonstrated promising early results for treatment of alcohol dependence. Detailed description of the content and methods of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, as it is conducted in clinical settings, is scarce. Methods: An open-label pilot (proof-of-concept) study of psilocybin-assisted treatment of alcohol dependence (NCT01534494) was conducted to generate data for a phase 2 RCT (NCT02061293) of a similar treatment in a larger population.

RATIONALE: (R,S)-ketamine is a rapid and effective antidepressant drug that produces a response in two thirds of patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The underlying biochemical differences between a (R,S)-ketamine responder (KET-R) and non-responder (KET-NR) have not been definitively identified but may involve serine metabolism. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between baseline plasma concentrations of D-serine and its precursor L-serine and antidepressant response to (R,S)-ketamine in TRD patients. METHODS: Plasma samples were obtained from 21 TRD patients at baseline, 60 min before initiation of the (R,S)-ketamine infusion. Patients were classified as KET-Rs (n = 8) or KET-NRs (n = 13) based upon the difference in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores at baseline and 230 min after infusion, with response defined as a ≥50 % decrease in MADRS score. The plasma concentrations of D-serine and L-serine were determined using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Baseline D-serine plasma concentrations were significantly lower in KET-Rs (3.02 ± 0.21 μM) than in KET-NRs (4.68 ± 0.81 μM), p < 0.001. A significant relationship between baseline D-serine plasma concentrations and percent change in MADRS at 230 min was determined using a Pearson correlation, r = 0.77, p < 0.001, with baseline D-serine explaining 60 % of the variance in (R,S)-ketamine response. The baseline concentrations of L-serine (L-Ser) in KET-Rs were also significantly lower than those measured in KET-NRs (66.2 ± 9.6 μM vs 242.9 ± 5.6 μM, respectively; p < 0.0001).

Patients were classified as <span class=""application-area"">KET-Rs</span> (n = 8) or <span class=""application-area"">KET-NRs</span> (n = 13) based upon the difference in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores at baseline and 230 min after infusion, with response defined as a ≥50 % decrease in MADRS score. The plasma concentrations of D-serine and L-serine were determined using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Baseline D-serine plasma concentrations were significantly lower in <span class=""application-area"">KET-Rs</span> (3.02 ± 0.21 μM) than in <span class=""application-area"">KET-NRs</span> (4.68 ± 0.81 μM), p < 0.001. A significant relationship between baseline D-serine plasma concentrations and percent change in MADRS at 230 min was determined using a Pearson correlation, r = 0.77, p < 0.001, with baseline D-serine explaining 60 % of the variance in <span class=""application-area"">(R,S)-ketamine</span> response. The baseline concentrations of L-serine (L-Ser) in <span class=""application-area"">KET-Rs</span> were also significantly lower than those measured in <span class=""application-area"">KET-NRs</span> (66.2 ± 9.6 μM vs 242.9 ± 5.6 μM, respectively; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that the baseline D-serine plasma concentrations were significantly lower in <span class=""application-area"">KET-Rs</span> than in <span class=""application-area"">KET-NRs</span> and suggest that this variable can be used to predict an antidepressant response following <span class=""application-area"">(R,S)-ketamine</span> administration.</p>

3100,"Psychological effects of (S)-ketamine and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT): a double-blind, cross-over study in healthy volunteers.^
INTRODUCTION: Pharmacological challenges with hallucinogens are used as models for psychosis in experimental research. The state induced by glutamate antagonists such as phencyclidine (PCP) is often considered as a more appropriate model of psychosis than the state induced by serotonergic hallucinogens such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT). However, so far, the psychological profiles of the two types of hallucinogenic drugs have never been studied directly in an experimental within-subject design. METHODS: Fifteen healthy volunteers were included in a double-blind, cross-over study with two doses of the serotonin 5-HT2A agonist DMT and the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist (S)-ketamine. RESULTS: Data are reported for nine subjects who completed both experimental days with both doses of the two drugs. The intensity of global psychological effects was similar for DMT and (S)-ketamine. However, phenomena resembling positive symptoms of schizophrenia, particularly positive formal thought disorder and inappropriate affect, were stronger after DMT. Phenomena resembling negative symptoms of schizophrenia, attention deficits, body perception disturbances and catatonia-like motor phenomena were stronger after (S)-ketamine. DISCUSSION: The present study suggests that the NMDA antagonist model of psychosis is not overall superior to the serotonin 5-HT2A agonist model. Rather, the two classes of drugs tend to model different aspects or types of schizophrenia. The NMDA antagonist state may be an appropriate model for psychoses with prominent negative and possibly also catatonic features, while the 5-HT2A agonist state may be a better model for psychoses of the paranoid type.","###Task

Your task is to generate an HTML version of an input text, marking up specific entities. The entities to be identified are: Application area, Dosage. Use HTML <span> tags to highlight these entities. Each <span> should have a class attribute indicating the type of entity.

###Entity Markup Guide
Use <span class=""application-area""> to denote Application area, <span class=""dosage""> to denote Dosage.

###Entity Defintions
Application area is defined as: The condition or disease of interest studied under the impact of the psychedelic substance in the present paper.

Dosage is defined as: The applied dosage(s) of the psychedelic substance(s) in the present study.

###Annotation Guidelines
Application area should be annotated according to the following criteria:
* Our working definition for the Application is any ""state labeled as diseases by virtue of consensus on prevalent sociocultural and medical values"". It has to have ""clearly identifiable diagnostic features and disease progression, and response to specific treatment.""
* As a general guideline, annotated entities should be conditions that have an ICD-10/11 code.
* Annotate only in title and/or the introductory part of the abstract, i.e., when the problem or objective of the study is discussed (including abbreviations). Do NOT annotate outcomes, such as ""the Hamilton Depression Scale"" should not be annotated. Similarly, ""antisuicidal response"" should not be annotated. Or: ""among participants, depression was reduced"", do NOT annotate depression.
* Do NOT annotate antidepressant.
* Do not annotate over brackets: ""…or bipolar disorder (BD) type 1 and type 2"", only bipolar disorder and BD should be annotated as two entities.
* Do NOT annotate very generic concepts like ""psychiatric condition""
* Annotate sweeping statements like ""…with major depressive and bipolar disorder"" as one entity.
* Annotate the reasonably necessary string, e.g., ""active suicidal ideation"", active suicidal ideation should be annotated. However, adjectives could be annotated, ""Depressed patients"", annotate Depressed but not patients. ""depressive symptoms"" should both be annotated (also symptoms of depression). In ""refractory anxiety disorder"", annotate the entire string.
* Further defining characteristics should be included: Acute/Chronic; Active/Inactive; Mild/Moderate/Severe; End Stage/Early Stage; Drug-resistant; Total/Partial; Intermittent/Relapsing and others. Similarly, ""Post-stroke"" should be annotated instead of only ""stroke"" because it refers to the phase after the acute stroke.
* Annotate abbreviations. Abbreviations should be annotated  separately. For instance,""Huntington disease (HD)""should be separated into two annotations: ""Huntington disease"" and ""HD.
* Of note, in ""Managing dissociative symptoms following esketamine"", dissociative symptoms are NOT the treatment target but the target of the study and should NOT be annotated (context is relevant).
* Cigarette addiction is a disorder but not smoking cessation.
* Can be empty, i.e., no annotation per abstract.
* Include .^ in the title for highlighting

Dosage should be annotated according to the following criteria:
* Only annotate for studies testing not more than 1 psychedelic substance (e.g., do not annotate in a study testing lsd and psilocybin, BUT annotate in a study testing psilocybin against midazolam)
* Do NOT annotate doses of other substances or of the psychedelic substance in other studies (e.g, mentioned by referencing other studies)
* Do not annotate concentrations of solutions but dosages, i.e., do NOT annotate 500mg/10 ml, but annotate 2mg/kg.
* Annotate the number and the corresponding unit.
* Annotate all reported doses for the respective psychedelic substance.
* Annotate only for single substance studies (i.e., do not annotate in abstracts which report the dosage of two or more psychedelic substances).
* Annotate the number including the unit.
* Annotate also the term ""between"" if pertinent, similarly ""or"" and ""and"" should be annotated. Do not annotate ""per device"".
* Annotate also relative dosages (e.g., 1 mg/kg), do not annotate the terms ""bw"" or ""body weight"" or similar if pertinent
* Do NOT annotate doses measured in e.g., plasma (like 4 mg/ml)
* Can be empty, i.e, no annotation per abstract.

9573,"Investigation of medical effect of multiple ketamine infusions on patients with major depressive disorder.^
OBJECTIVE: Single-dose intravenous ketamine has rapid but time-limited antidepressant effects. We aimed to examine the sustained effects of six consecutive ketamine infusions in Chinese patients with major depressive disorder. METHODS: Seventy-seven patients with major depressive disorder were eligible to receive augmentation with six ketamine infusions (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min) administered over the course of 12 days (Monday-Wednesday-Friday). The coprimary outcome measures were the rates of response and remission as measured on the 10-item Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. Psychotomimetic and dissociative symptoms were measured with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale-positive symptoms and the Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale, respectively. RESULTS: After the first ketamine infusion, only 10 (13.0%) and 6 (7.8%) patients responded and remitted, respectively; after six ketamine infusions, 52 (67.5%) patients responded and 37 (48.1%) remitted. There was a significant mean decrease in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score at four hours after the first ketamine infusion (7.0±7.5, p<0.001), and this decrease was maintained for the duration of the infusion period. The response to ketamine treatment was positively associated with no history of psychiatric hospitalization (odds ratio=3.56, p=0.009). Suicidal ideation rapidly decreased across the entire study sample, even among the nonresponder group. No significant differences were found regarding Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale scores from the first infusion at baseline to four hours post-infusion. CONCLUSION: Six ketamine infusions increased rates of response and remission when compared to a single-dose ketamine infusion in patients with major depressive disorder. Future controlled studies are warranted to confirm and expand these findings.","###Task

Dosage is defined as: The applied dosage(s) of the psychedelic substance(s) in the present study.

###Annotation Guidelines
Application area should be annotated according to the following criteria:
* Our working definition for the Application is any ""state labeled as diseases by virtue of consensus on prevalent sociocultural and medical values"". It has to have ""clearly identifiable diagnostic features and disease progression, and response to specific treatment.""
* As a general guideline, annotated entities should be conditions that have an ICD-10/11 code.
* Annotate only in title and/or the introductory part of the abstract, i.e., when the problem or objective of the study is discussed (including abbreviations). Do NOT annotate outcomes, such as ""the Hamilton Depression Scale"" should not be annotated. Similarly, ""antisuicidal response"" should not be annotated. Or: ""among participants, depression was reduced"", do NOT annotate depression.
* Do NOT annotate antidepressant.
* Do not annotate over brackets: ""…or bipolar disorder (BD) type 1 and type 2"", only bipolar disorder and BD should be annotated as two entities.
* Do NOT annotate very generic concepts like ""psychiatric condition""
* Annotate sweeping statements like ""…with major depressive and bipolar disorder"" as one entity.
* Annotate the reasonably necessary string, e.g., ""active suicidal ideation"", active suicidal ideation should be annotated. However, adjectives could be annotated, ""Depressed patients"", annotate Depressed but not patients. ""depressive symptoms"" should both be annotated (also symptoms of depression). In ""refractory anxiety disorder"", annotate the entire string.
* Further defining characteristics should be included: Acute/Chronic; Active/Inactive; Mild/Moderate/Severe; End Stage/Early Stage; Drug-resistant; Total/Partial; Intermittent/Relapsing and others. Similarly, ""Post-stroke"" should be annotated instead of only ""stroke"" because it refers to the phase after the acute stroke.
* Annotate abbreviations. Abbreviations should be annotated  separately. For instance,""Huntington disease (HD)""should be separated into two annotations: ""Huntington disease"" and ""HD.
* Of note, in ""Managing dissociative symptoms following esketamine"", dissociative symptoms are NOT the treatment target but the target of the study and should NOT be annotated (context is relevant).
* Cigarette addiction is a disorder but not smoking cessation.
* Can be empty, i.e., no annotation per abstract.
* Include .^ in the title for highlighting

Dosage should be annotated according to the following criteria:
* Only annotate for studies testing not more than 1 psychedelic substance (e.g., do not annotate in a study testing lsd and psilocybin, BUT annotate in a study testing psilocybin against midazolam)
* Do NOT annotate doses of other substances or of the psychedelic substance in other studies (e.g, mentioned by referencing other studies)
* Do not annotate concentrations of solutions but dosages, i.e., do NOT annotate 500mg/10 ml, but annotate 2mg/kg.
* Annotate the number and the corresponding unit.
* Annotate all reported doses for the respective psychedelic substance.
* Annotate only for single substance studies (i.e., do not annotate in abstracts which report the dosage of two or more psychedelic substances).
* Annotate the number including the unit.
* Annotate also the term ""between"" if pertinent, similarly ""or"" and ""and"" should be annotated. Do not annotate ""per device"".
* Annotate also relative dosages (e.g., 1 mg/kg), do not annotate the terms ""bw"" or ""body weight"" or similar if pertinent
* Do NOT annotate doses measured in e.g., plasma (like 4 mg/ml)
* Can be empty, i.e, no annotation per abstract.

INPUT: Investigation of medical effect of multiple ketamine infusions on patients with major depressive disorder.^
OBJECTIVE: Single-dose intravenous ketamine has rapid but time-limited antidepressant effects. We aimed to examine the sustained effects of six consecutive ketamine infusions in Chinese patients with major depressive disorder. METHODS: Seventy-seven patients with major depressive disorder were eligible to receive augmentation with six ketamine infusions (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min) administered over the course of 12 days (Monday-Wednesday-Friday). The coprimary outcome measures were the rates of response and remission as measured on the 10-item Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. Psychotomimetic and dissociative symptoms were measured with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale-positive symptoms and the Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale, respectively. RESULTS: After the first ketamine infusion, only 10 (13.0%) and 6 (7.8%) patients responded and remitted, respectively; after six ketamine infusions, 52 (67.5%) patients responded and 37 (48.1%) remitted. There was a significant mean decrease in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score at four hours after the first ketamine infusion (7.0±7.5, p<0.001), and this decrease was maintained for the duration of the infusion period. The response to ketamine treatment was positively associated with no history of psychiatric hospitalization (odds ratio=3.56, p=0.009). Suicidal ideation rapidly decreased across the entire study sample, even among the nonresponder group. No significant differences were found regarding Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale scores from the first infusion at baseline to four hours post-infusion. CONCLUSION: Six ketamine infusions increased rates of response and remission when compared to a single-dose ketamine infusion in patients with major depressive disorder. Future controlled studies are warranted to confirm and expand these findings.

2556,"Low-dose ketamine for treatment resistant depression in an academic clinical practice setting.^
BACKGROUND: Recent studies demonstrating a rapid, robust improvement in treatment resistant depression (TRD) following a single sub-anesthetic infusion of ketamine have generated much excitement. However, these studies are limited in their generalizability to the broader TRD population due to their subject exclusion criteria which typically limit psychiatric comorbidity, concurrent medication, and level of suicide risk. This paper describes the safety and efficacy of sub-anesthetic ketamine infusions in a naturalistic TRD patient sample participating in a real-world TRD treatment program within a major university health system. METHODS: The effects of a sub-anesthetic dose (0.5mg/kg) of ketamine infused IV over forty minutes on TRD patients participating in a treatment program at the University of California, San Diego was investigated by retrospectively analyzing the medical charts of 41 adult TRD patients with a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or Bipolar Disorder (BD). RESULTS: Subjects were aged 48.6, 78% white, 36.6% female, and 82.9% had MDD. Significant psychiatric comorbidity existed in 73%. Average pre-infusion BDI score was 32.6 ± 8.4 (S.D) and dropped to 16.8 ± 3.1 at 24-h post-infusion (p < 0.001). The 24-h response (≥ 50% reduction from pre-infusion) and remission (BDI <13) rates were 53.7% and 41.5%, respectively. Three quarters of responders maintained responder status at 7-days. Ketamine infusions were well tolerated with occasional nausea or anxiety and mild hemodynamic effects during the infusion. LIMITATIONS: Retrospective nature of this study, lack of control group and use of self-report depression ratings scales. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first published study of sub-anesthetic ketamine infusions in a real-world TRD population. The results suggest that this treatment is effective and well tolerated in this population.","###Task
