1939,"Auditory event-related potentials (P3) and cognitive performance in recreational ecstasy polydrug users: Evidence from a 12-month longitudinal study.^\nRationale: There is important preclinical evidence of the long-lasting neurotoxic and selective effects of ecstasy (MDMA) on serotonin systems in nonhuman primates. In humans, long-term recreational use of ecstasy has been mainly associated with memory impairment. Objective: The first aim of our study was to evaluate the cognitive and electrophysiological long-term alterations associated with lifetime ecstasy use within a sample of ecstasy polydrug users along a 1-year follow-up. Our second aim was to explore the relationship between specific cognitive functions and P300 (P3) event-related potentials (ERPs) in ecstasy users. Materials and methods: We conducted auditory P3 latency and amplitude and administered a battery of cognitive tests to three groups of subjects: 14 current ecstasy polydrug users, 13 current cannabis users, and 22 controls free of illicit drugs in two evaluations during 1 year. Results: We found significant differences between ecstasy users and controls on cognitive measures of word fluency, processing speed, and memory recognition after 1-year follow-up. We found no significant differences between ecstasy and cannabis users or cannabis users and controls on cognitive tests. Lifetime ecstasy use was associated with poorer memory recognition. No group differences were shown on P3 latency or amplitude. Significant correlations emerged between P3 latency and cannabis lifetime use (higher cannabis use was related to faster latency, showing a paradoxical effect) but not with ecstasy exposure. Conclusions: Our findings provide evidence of mild long-term cognitive deficits among ecstasy polydrug users. Both ecstasy use and the dynamic interaction between ecstasy and cannabis effects may account for these deficits. No significant P3 alterations were found in ecstasy users. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",3,"[0.00035084341652691364, 0.0023887152783572674, 0.001281930017285049, 0.9959784746170044]",3
1787,"Low dose ketamine infusion for comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder and chronic pain: A randomized double-blind clinical trial.^\nObjective: To date, treatment options (i.e. psychotherapy, antidepressant medications) for patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), are relatively few, and considering their limited efficacy, novel therapies have gained interest among researchers and treatment providers alike. Among patients with chronic pain (CP) about one third experience comorbid PTSD, which further complicates their already challenging pharmacological regimens. Low dose ketamine infusion has shown promise in PTSD, and in treatment of CP, however they have not been studied in comorbid population and under rigorous control conditions. Methods: We compared the effects of a single dose of either ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or ketorolac (15 mg) over a 40-minute of IV infusion in CP patients with and without PTSD, in double blind, randomized study. Measures were collected before, during, one day and seven days after the infusion. A planned sample size of 40 patients randomly assigned to treatment order was estimated to provide 80% power to detect a hypothesized treatment difference after the infusion. Main Outcome and Measures: The primary outcome measures were change in PTSD symptom severity assessed with the Impact of Event Scale–Revised (IES-R) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain administered by a study clinician 24 hours post infusion. Secondary outcome measures included Impact of Event Scale–Revised (IES-R), VAS and Brief Pain Inventory (Short Form) for pain 1 week after the infusion. Results: Both treatments offered comparable improvement of PTSD and CP symptoms that persisted for 7 days after the infusion. Patients with comorbid PTSD and CP experienced less dissociative side effects compared to the CP group. Surprisingly, ketorolac infusion resulted in dissociative symptoms in CP patients only. Conclusions: This first prospective study comparing effects of subanesthetic ketamine versus ketorolac infusions for comorbid PTSD and CP, suggests that both ketamine and ketorolac might offer meaningful and durable response for both PTSD and CP symptoms.

5628,"An encounter with the self: A thematic and content analysis of the DMT experience from a naturalistic field study.^\nINTRODUCTION: N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is an endogenous serotonergic psychedelic capable of producing radical shifts in an experience that have significant implications for consciousness and its neural correlates, especially given the ""disconnected consciousness"" suggested by the ""breakthrough"" DMT state. Its increasing usage and clinical trial indicate the growing importance of a thorough elucidation of the experience's qualitative content, over and above the phenomenological structure. This is particularly in light of the intensely pervasive effects of DMT occasions in all dimensions of the self, which are often ontologically challenging yet potentially transformative. METHODS: This is the second report on the first naturalistic field study of DMT use exploring its qualitative analysis. Screened, healthy, anonymized, and experienced DMT users were observed during their non-clinical use of the drug at home (40-75-mg inhaled). In-depth semi-structured interviews, inspired by the micro-phenomenological technique, were employed immediately after their experience. This study reports on the thematic and content analysis of one major domain of the breakthrough experiences elicited, the ""self""; where analyses of the ""other"" were previously reported. A total of 36 post-DMT experience interviews with mostly Caucasian (83%) men (eight women) of a mean of 37 years were predominantly inductively coded. RESULTS: Invariably, profound and highly intense experiences occurred. The first overarching category comprised the onset of effects, encompassing super-ordinate themes including sensory, emotion and body, and space-time shifts; the second category comprised bodily effects, encompassing themes including pleasurable, neutral/both, and uncomfortable; the third category comprised the sensorial effects, encompassing open-eye, visual, and cross-modal and other; the fourth comprised the psychological effects, encompassing memory and language, awareness and sense of self, and time distortions; and the fifth comprised the emotional effects, encompassing positive, neither/both, and challenging experiences. Many further subthemes also illuminate the rich content of the DMT experience. DISCUSSION: The present study provides a systematic and nuanced analysis of the content of the breakthrough DMT state pertaining to one's personal and self-referential experiences of the body, senses, psychology, and emotions. The resonances both with previous DMT studies and other types of extraordinary experiences, such as the alien abduction, shamanic and near-death experiences, are also elaborated upon. Putative neural mechanisms and their promise as a psychotherapeutic agent, especially owing to deep emotional impact, are discussed.",3,"[0.00018866117170546204, 0.00045260851038619876, 0.000789377954788506, 0.9985693693161011]",3
3492,"Nature-themed video intervention may improve cardiovascular safety of psilocybin-assisted therapy for alcohol use disorder.^\nINTRODUCTION: Psychedelic-assisted therapy with psilocybin has shown promise in Phase 2 trials for alcohol use disorder (AUD). Set and setting, particularly factors facilitating a connection with nature, may positively influence the psychedelic experience and therapeutic outcomes. But to date, randomized controlled trials of interventions to enhance set and setting for psychedelic-assisted therapy are lacking. METHODS: This was a pilot randomized, controlled trial of Visual Healing, a nature-themed video intervention to optimize set and setting, versus Standard set and setting procedures with two open-label psilocybin 25 mg dosing sessions among 20 participants with AUD. For the first session, participants randomized to Visual Healing viewed nature-themed videos during the preparation session and the ""ascent"" and ""descent"" phases of the psilocybin dosing session while participants randomized to the Standard condition completed a meditation during the preparatory session and wore eyeshades and listened to a music playlist throughout the dosing session. For the second session 4 weeks later, participants chose either Visual Healing or Standard procedures. Primary outcomes were feasibility, safety, and tolerability of Visual Healing. Secondary and exploratory outcomes were changes in alcohol use, psychedelic effects, anxiety and stress. RESULTS: Nineteen of 20 (95%) randomized participants (mean age 49 ± 11 years, 60% female) completed the 14-week study. During the first psilocybin session, participants viewed an average of 37.9 min of the 42-min video and there were no video-related adverse events. Peak increase in post-psilocybin blood pressure was significantly less for participants randomly assigned to Visual Healing compared to Standard procedures. Alcohol use decreased significantly in both Visual Healing and Standard groups and psychedelic effects, stress, and anxiety were similar between groups. DISCUSSION: In this open-label pilot study, viewing Visual Healing videos during preparation and psilocybin dosing sessions was feasible, safe, and well-tolerated among participants with AUD. Preliminary findings suggest that Visual Healing has potential to reduce the cardiovascular risks of psychedelic therapy, without interfering with the psychedelic experience or alcohol-related treatment outcomes.

1316,"Cognitive effects of intramuscular ketamine and oral triazolam in healthy volunteers.^\nRATIONALE: Several studies have documented impairments in memory processes as a result of ketamine administration; however, few studies have compared the profile of cognitive effects of ketamine to other drugs. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the cognitive effects of ketamine with those of triazolam in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Doses of ketamine (0.2, 0.4 mg/kg intramuscular (i.m.)), triazolam (0.2, 0.4 mg/70 kg p.o.), and double-dummy placebos were administered to 20 volunteers under repeated measures, counterbalanced, double-blind conditions. Peak physiological, psychomotor, subjective, and cognitive effects were examined. RESULTS: Ketamine impaired balance when balance was assessed early in the task order, whereas triazolam impaired psychomotor coordination and divided attention irrespective of task order. Triazolam also tended to produce greater effects on working memory and episodic memory tasks than ketamine at doses that produced lower subjective effects and higher estimates of performance. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine produces less cognitive impairment than triazolam at doses that produced greater subjective effects. Thus ketamine does not produce the underestimation of cognitive impairment typically seen with triazolam.",3,"[0.0008238279260694981, 0.0015818068059161305, 0.0007443889044225216, 0.9968499541282654]",3
3719,"Turn on, Tune in, and Drop out: Predictors of Attrition in a Prospective Observational Cohort Study on Psychedelic Use.^\nBACKGROUND: The resurgence of research and public interest in the positive psychological effects of psychedelics, together with advancements in digital data collection techniques, have brought forth a new type of research design, which involves prospectively gathering large-scale naturalistic data from psychedelic users; that is, before and after the use of a psychedelic compound. A methodological limitation of such studies is their high attrition rate, particularly owing to participants who stop responding after initial study enrollment. Importantly, study dropout can introduce systematic biases that may affect the interpretability of results. OBJECTIVE: Based on a previously collected sample (baseline n=654), here we investigated potential determinants of study attrition in web-based prospective studies on psychedelic use. METHODS: Logistic regression models were used to examine demographic, psychological trait and state, and psychedelic-specific predictors of dropout. Predictors were assessed 1 week before, 1 day after, and 2 weeks after psychedelic use, with attrition being defined as noncompletion of the key endpoint 4 weeks post experience. RESULTS: Predictors of attrition were found among demographic variables including age (β=0.024; P=.007) and educational levels, as well as personality traits, specifically conscientiousness (β=-0.079; P=.02) and extraversion (β=0.082; P=.01). Contrary to prior hypotheses, neither baseline attitudes toward psychedelics nor the intensity of acute challenging experiences were predictive of dropout. CONCLUSIONS: The baseline predictors of attrition identified here are consistent with those reported in longitudinal studies in other scientific disciplines, suggesting their transdisciplinary relevance. Moreover, the lack of an association between attrition and psychedelic advocacy or negative drug experiences in our sample contextualizes concerns about problematic biases in these and related data.",1,"[0.0053564016707241535, 0.9324806332588196, 0.021052096039056778, 0.04111091047525406]",1
8810,"Quitting ecstasy: An investigation of why people stop taking the drug and their subsequent mental health.^\nThe regular use of ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA) has been associated with depressed mood, anxiety and hostility, but it is not known whether such effects persist after people stop using the drug. Furthermore, little is known about what factors might influence the decision to quit using MDMA. The aim of the present study was to examine the reasons why ex-users had stopped using this drug and to assess their current levels of depression, anxiety, anger and aggression. Telephone interviews were conducted with people who used to take MDMA on a regular basis but who no longer used the drug. The participants comprised sixty-six ex-users who used to take MDMA regularly (at least once every 2 months over a period of at least 1 year), but who had not taken MDMA for at least 1 year (average 3 years). Participants were asked about why they had quit MDMA. They also completed questionnaires to assess trait mood. Ex-users could be divided into two groups based on their reason for quitting: (i) those who had quit for mental health reasons and (ii) those who had quit for circumstantial reasons. Approximately half of those in the mental health group scored in the range for clinical depression. In that group, current levels of depression and anxiety correlated significantly with the cumulative amount of MDMA that they had taken several years previously. These findings suggest that some users may either be more vulnerable to the adverse effects of MDMA or have pre-existing mental health problems for which they self-medicate by using ecstasy. The present study shows that some ex-users experience an impairment to mental health that persists for years after they stop using this drug.",3,"[0.0003311128239147365, 0.0006151815177872777, 0.0007129156729206443, 0.9983407258987427]",3

A mixed-methods design was used comparing treatment responders versus non-responders, as well as content coding of themes from open-ended questions. Most participants reported positive persisting effects of ibogaine detoxification (e.g., enhanced personal sense of gratitude and authenticity, and meaning and appreciation for life). Compared to non-responders, treatment responders endorsed greater persisting changes in their ability to tolerate difficult/painful feelings, capacity for coping with stress, and reduced unhealthy anger. Treatment responders reported greater change in subjective levels of inner peace, joy, feelings of love/openheartedness, and experiences of sacredness in life. Qualitative analyses revealed that treatment responders reported a heightened sense of spiritual awareness and greater connection to their intra-/interpersonal relationships after ibogaine detoxification. Notable challenges of ibogaine detoxification included psychological and health-related difficulties during treatment and challenges with post-treatment integration.

6200,"Effects of LSD on Neuroplasticity in Healthy Subjects.^\nNeuroplasticity is the brain's ability to reorganize itself and adapt in response to changing environmental conditions or pathological stimuli. Its dysregulation may play a role in the etiology of depression and anxiety disorders, and it is also essential for recovery from neural injury and stroke. LSD is a potent psychedelic drug and a member of the psychoplastogen family of small molecules, which are able to rapidly stimulate neuroplasticity in cortical neurons following a single dose. Previous research suggests that changes in neuroplasticity may contribute to LSD's long‐term effects, which include increases in subjective well‐being and life satisfaction, reduced anxiety, and increased openness to experience. Additionally, there is some evidence that LSD and other psychedelics could be viable clinical treatments for depression, anxiety, and addictive disorders, and that changes in neuroplasticity may underlie this clinical potential. However, there is still little direct evidence that LSD or other psychoplastogens enhance cortical plasticity in humans. The goal of this study is to investigate the effects of LSD on several measures of neuroplasticity in healthy human subjects, as well as other abilities and traits thought to be related to neuroplasticity. Determining whether LSD enhances cortical plasticity, how long this may last, where in the brain it occurs, and what it means for cognition and emotion is essential for understanding LSD's long‐term effects, including but not limited to its clinical potential.",1,"[0.006888461299240589, 0.8953033089637756, 0.00464410986751318, 0.09316415339708328]",1
4848,"Clonazepam treatment of lysergic acid diethylamide-induced hallucinogen persisting perception disorder with anxiety features.^\nAn unique and intriguing characteristic of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and LSD-like substances is the recurrence of some of the symptoms which appear during the intoxication, in the absence of recent intake of hallucinogens. Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD) is a condition in which the re-experiencing of one or more perceptual symptoms causes significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning and may be extremely debilitating. Benzodiazepines are one of the recommended agents for the treatment of HPPD but it is unclear which of them may be more helpful. The goal of our investigation was to assess the efficacy of clonazepam in the treatment of LSD-induced HPPD. Sixteen patients fulfilled entrance criteria. All complained of HPPD with anxiety features for at least 3 months and were drug free at least 3 months. They received clonazepam 2 mg/day for 2 months. Follow-up was continued for 6 months. They were weekly evaluated during the 2 months of clonazepam administration and monthly during the follow-up period using the Clinical Global Impression Scale, a Self-report Scale and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale. Patients reported a significant relief and the presence of only mild symptomatology during the clonazepam administration. This improvement was clearly sustained and persisted during a 6-month follow-up period.

4292,"Psychedelic Communitas: Intersubjective Experience During Psychedelic Group Sessions Predicts Enduring Changes in Psychological Wellbeing and Social Connectedness.^\nBackground: Recent years have seen a resurgence of research on the potential of psychedelic substances to treat addictive and mood disorders. Historically and contemporarily, psychedelic studies have emphasized the importance of contextual elements ('set and setting') in modulating acute drug effects, and ultimately, influencing long-term outcomes. Nevertheless, current small-scale clinical and laboratory studies have tended to bypass a ubiquitous contextual feature of naturalistic psychedelic use: its social dimension. This study introduces and psychometrically validates an adapted Communitas Scale, assessing acute relational experiences of perceived togetherness and shared humanity, in order to investigate psychosocial mechanisms pertinent to psychedelic ceremonies and retreats. Methods: In this observational, web-based survey study, participants (N = 886) were measured across five successive time-points: 2 weeks before, hours before, and the day after a psychedelic ceremony; as well as the day after, and 4 weeks after leaving the ceremony location. Demographics, psychological traits and state variables were assessed pre-ceremony, in addition to changes in psychological wellbeing and social connectedness from before to after the retreat, as primary outcomes. Using correlational and multiple regression (path) analyses, predictive relationships between psychosocial 'set and setting' variables, communitas, and long-term outcomes were explored. Results: The adapted Communitas Scale demonstrated substantial internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.92) and construct validity in comparison with validated measures of intra-subjective (visual, mystical, challenging experiences questionnaires) and inter-subjective (perceived emotional synchrony, identity fusion) experiences. Furthermore, communitas during ceremony was significantly correlated with increases in psychological wellbeing (r = 0.22), social connectedness (r = 0.25), and other salient mental health outcomes. Path analyses revealed that the effect of ceremony-communitas on long-term outcomes was fully mediated by communitas experienced in reference to the retreat overall, and that the extent of personal sharing or 'self-disclosure' contributed to this process. A positive relationship between participants and facilitators, and the perceived impact of emotional support, facilitated the emergence of communitas. Conclusion: Highlighting the importance of intersubjective experience, rapport, and emotional support for long-term outcomes of psychedelic use, this first quantitative examination of psychosocial factors in guided psychedelic settings is a significant step toward evidence-based benefit-maximization guidelines for collective psychedelic use.",3,"[0.00031591608421877027, 0.0018281647935509682, 0.0013795047998428345, 0.9964764714241028]",3
1286,"The effect of acutely administered MDMA on subjective and BOLD-fMRI responses to favourite and worst autobiographical memories.^\n3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a potent monoamine-releaser that is widely used as a recreational drug. Preliminary work has supported the potential of MDMA in psychotherapy for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The neurobiological mechanisms underlying its putative efficacy are, however, poorly understood. Psychotherapy for PTSD usually requires that patients revisit traumatic memories, and it has been argued that this is easier to do under MDMA. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to investigate the effect of MDMA on recollection of favourite and worst autobiographical memories (AMs). Nineteen participants (five females) with previous experience with MDMA performed a blocked AM recollection (AMR) paradigm after ingestion of 100 mg of MDMA-HCl or ascorbic acid (placebo) in a double-blind, repeated-measures design. Memory cues describing participants' AMs were read by them in the scanner. Favourite memories were rated as significantly more vivid, emotionally intense and positive after MDMA than placebo and worst memories were rated as less negative. Functional MRI data from 17 participants showed robust activations to AMs in regions known to be involved in AMR. There was also a significant effect of memory valence: hippocampal regions showed preferential activations to favourite memories and executive regions to worst memories. MDMA augmented activations to favourite memories in the bilateral fusiform gyrus and somatosensory cortex and attenuated activations to worst memories in the left anterior temporal cortex. These findings are consistent with a positive emotional-bias likely mediated by MDMA's pro-monoaminergic pharmacology.",3,"[0.0005373791791498661, 0.0009890233632177114, 0.0006526925717480481, 0.9978209733963013]",3

PubMed search inclusive of ""ketamine"" and ""suicide"" yielded 358 results. Papers (N = 354) were then read by at least two authors, identifying 12 meeting eligibility requirements and eleven RCTs examining whether ketamine treatment ameliorated SI. Four of five RCTs examined racemic ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) given intravenously and found an advantage for ketamine over control for rapid reduction in SI in acutely depressed patients. Two studies examined intranasal esketamine in depressed suicidal patients and found no advantage over saline.

Currently, there are no effective pharmacological treatments for cannabis use disorder. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this uncontrolled proof of concept trial was to test the feasibility, tolerability, and potential therapeutic effects of integrating ketamine infusions with a behavioral platform of motivational enhancement therapy and mindfulness-based relapse prevention in treating cannabis use disorder (CUD). METHODS: Eight cannabis-dependent individuals (four female, four male) receiving motivational enhancement therapy and mindfulness-based relapse prevention behavioral treatments completed this single-blind outpatient 6-week study. Participants received either one or two infusions of ketamine (0.71 mg/kg [infusion 1]; 1.41 mg/kg [infusion 2] for non-responders) during the study. Participants self-reported cannabis use (Timeline Follow-Back) and underwent an assessment of confidence in abstaining from using cannabis (Drug-Taking Confidence Questionnaire) at predetermined time points throughout the study.

Psychotomimetic, perceptual, cognitive, and neuroendocrine responses.^\nBACKGROUND: To characterize further behavioral, cognitive, neuroendocrine, and physiological effects of subanesthetic doses of ketamine hydrochloride in healthy human subjects. Ketamine, a phencyclidine hydrochloride derivative, is a dissociative anesthetic and a noncompetitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of excitatory amino acid receptor. METHODS: Nineteen healthy subjects recruited by advertisements from the community participated in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Subjects completed three test days involving the 40-minute intravenous administration of placebo, ketamine hydrochloride (0.1 mg/kg), or ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg). Behaviors associated with the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia were assessed by using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Changes in perception and behaviors associated with dissociative states were assessed by the Perceptual Aberration Subscale of the Wisconsin Psychosis Proneness Scale and the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale. Cognitive function was assessed by using the (1) Mini-Mental State Examination; (2) tests sensitive to frontal cortical dysfunction, including a continuous performance vigilance task, a verbal fluency task, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; and (3) tests of immediate and delayed recall. Plasma levels of cortisol, prolactin, homovanillic acid, and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethyleneglycol were measured. RESULTS: Ketamine (1) produced behaviors similar to the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia; (2) elicited alterations in perception; (3) impaired performance on tests of vigilance, verbal fluency, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; (4) evoked symptoms similar to dissociative states; and (5) preferentially disrupted delayed word recall, sparing immediate recall and postdistraction recall. Ketamine had no significant effect on the Mini-Mental State Examination at the doses studied.

3480,"Subjective ratings of prospective memory deficits in MDMA ('ecstasy') users.^\nChronic use of MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine), or 'ecstasy', is associated with significant cognitive impairments, particularly in laboratory and field tests of memory for previously encoded material. Less is known about the effects of a history of MDMA use on aspects of everyday cognitive functioning-of which prospective memory (typically characterised as 'remembering to do something at some future point') is an important aspect. Self-ratings of prospective memory among 30 regular ecstasy users (taking the drug 10 or more times per month) and 31 ecstasy-free controls were compared. Each participant completed the Prospective Memory Questionnaire, which measures self-rated error frequencies relating to three aspects of prospective memory (short-term habitual, long-term episodic and internally cued); the scale also records the use of strategies to aid remembering. Compared with non-users, ecstasy users reported significantly more self-rated errors in prospective memory, and effect which was evident after co-varying levels of other drug use. There were no significant differences in the use of strategies to aid memory. These findings provide new insights into prospective memory dysfunction in recreational drug users. Prospective memory deficits may be related to the reported serotonergic and frontal lobe deficits in chronic MDMA users. It is necessary to use more objective tasks to assess putative prospective memory deficits in ecstasy users.

8711,"Efficacy and safety results from the first pivotal phase 3 randomized controlled trial of mdma-assisted psychotherapy for treatment of severe chronic PTSD.^\nIntroduction: Posttraumatic stress disorder is a prevalent mental health condition with substantial impact on daily functioning that lacks sufficient treatment options. Previous research has led to the designation of 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) as a Breakthrough Therapy for treatment of post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) when administered as an adjunct to psychotherapy. Objectives: Here we report the findings of the first randomized, double‐blind, Phase 3 trial assessing the efficacy and safety of 3 sessions with a flexible dose of MDMA or placebo administered under direct observation to participants with severe PTSD (n = 100) as an adjunct to inner‐directed psychotherapy. Methods: Change in PTSD symptoms (CAPS‐5) and functional impairment (SDS) were assessed by a central, blinded Independent Rater Pool at baseline and following each treatment session. Adverse events (AEs), concomitant medications, suicidal ideation and behavior were tracked throughout the study. Vital signs were measured during experimental sessions. The primary endpoint was 18 weeks post‐randomization. Results: Change in CAPS‐5 and SDS, placebo‐subtracted Cohen's d effect size, and a responder analysis will be presented. There were three serious AEs of suicidal ideation or behavior reported.MDMA was well tolerated, with some treatment emergent AEs occurring at greater frequency for the MDMA group during and after experimental sessions.

The intervention was developed so it could be used by peer and other drug workers. The evaluation was a two-condition, multi-site, randomized controlled trial with a single 6-month follow-up. Participants were 16-22 years old. They identified themselves to be primary users of cocaine hydrochloride, crack cocaine, or ecstasy and were subsequently assigned to these primary stimulant groups for analysis.

Trial participants were recruited in 11 sites in Greater London and Kent using detached outreach, specific advertising campaigns, and by participant-driven snowball-sampling methods. Six-month follow-up interviews were successfully conducted with 299 participants. The participant recruitment methodology used in the trial was successful, showing that longitudinal, experimental studies with young out-of-treatment drug users are quite feasible.

DATA SOURCES: A systematic review was conducted using Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Central, and Web of Science through September 2023 using the following terminology: ""psilocybin"" AND ""mental-disease"" OR ""substance-dependence"" AND ""disease-therapy,"" in addition to other synonymous key words. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Literature reporting acute effects and safety data following the use of psilocybin as the pharmacologic intervention in a clinical trial in adult patients with a psychiatric or substance-dependence condition were included. Following the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 16 studies were ultimately included in this review. DATA SYNTHESIS: The most common treatment-emergent adverse effects reported were transient nausea and headache. Transient anxiety was reported as a frequent psychiatric effect, and 3 participants received a benzodiazepine for refractory anxiety during the psilocybin session. Psilocybin demonstrated modest increases in blood pressure and heart rate, and 1 participant received an antihypertensive for sustained hypertension during the psilocybin session. No cases of psilocybin-induced psychosis or Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder were reported. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE: Treatment resistance remains a concern for psychiatric patients and novel therapies are needed to help alleviate the burden of morbidity and mortality. Psilocybin demonstrates promising acute and long-term safety that may allow for its use in psychiatric or substance-dependence conditions as an alternative to standards of care or in treatment-resistant patients.

5901,"Ayahuasca’s ‘afterglow’: improved mindfulness and cognitive flexibility in ayahuasca drinkers.^\nRationale: There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating the therapeutic potential of ayahuasca for treating depression and anxiety. However, the mechanisms of action involved in ayahuasca’s therapeutic effects are unclear. Mindfulness and cognitive flexibility may be two possible psychological mechanisms. Like other classic psychedelics, ayahuasca also leads to an ‘afterglow’ effect of improved subjective well-being that persists after the acute effects have subsided. This period may offer a window of increased therapeutic potential. Objective: To explore changes in mindfulness and cognitive flexibility before and within 24 h after ayahuasca use. Methods: Forty-eight participants (54% female) were assessed on measures of mindfulness (Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ)), decentering (Experiences Questionnaire (EQ)), and cognitive flexibility (Cognitive Flexibility Scale (CFS)), and completed the Stroop and Wisconsin Picture Card Sorting Task (WPCST) before drinking ayahuasca, and again within 24 h. Results: Mindfulness (FFMQ total scores and four of the five mindfulness facets: observe, describe, act with awareness, and non-reactivity) and decentering (EQ) significantly increased in the 24 h after ayahuasca use. Cognitive flexibility (CFS and WPCST) significantly improved in the 24 h after ayahuasca use. Changes in both mindfulness and cognitive flexibility were not influenced by prior ayahuasca use. Conclusions: The present study supports ayahuasca’s ability to enhance mindfulness and further reports changes in cognitive flexibility in the ‘afterglow’ period occur, suggesting both could be possible psychological mechanisms concerning the psychotherapeutic effects of ayahuasca. Given psychological gains occurred regardless of prior ayahuasca use suggests potentially therapeutic effects for both naïve and experienced ayahuasca drinkers.",3,"[0.00028016112628392875, 0.00033802635152824223, 0.0005830451264046133, 0.9987987279891968]",3
8087,"A single-infusion of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine improves fatigue scores in patients with bipolar disorder compared to placebo.^\nBackground: Fatigue is a highly prevalent residual symptom of depression that is difficult to treat with current monoaminergic antidepressants. Research has shown that ketamine, an N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that manipulates the glutamate system, produces rapid, robust, and moderately sustained improvements in depressive symptoms. However, there is a dearth of literature examining the effects of ketamine on fatigue specifically. We hypothesized that ketamine would rapidly improve fatigue symptoms in treatment‐resistant bipolar depressed patients. Methods: In a double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled, crossover study, 36 participants with treatment‐resistant bipolar depression (maintained on therapeutic levels of lithium or valproate) received a single intravenous infusion of ketamine hydrochloride at a dose of 0.5mg/kg over 40 minutes or placebo on 2 experimental days separated by 2 weeks. A post‐hoc analysis compared fatigue scores on ketamine vs. placebo from 40 minutes through 14 days using a novel scale (based on questions from validated rating scales). Results: A linear mixed model showed that patients had significantly lower fatigue scores following ketamine compared to placebo from 40 minutes (p=.002) through day 3 (p<.001). The drug difference was not significant at day 7 (p=.10), but it was at day 10 (p=.03) and 14 (p=.004). The largest difference was at day 2 (p<.001; d=.58). Conclusions: Ketamine rapidly and significantly improved fatigue symptoms relative to placebo in a group of treatment‐resistant bipolar depressed patients.

2861,"Optimal dosing for psilocybin pharmacotherapy: Considering weight-adjusted and fixed dosing approaches.^\nBackground: Growing evidence suggests psilocybin, a naturally occurring psychedelic, is a safe and promising pharmacotherapy for treatment of mood and substance use disorders when administered as part of a structured intervention. In most trials to date, psilocybin dose has been administered on a weight-adjusted basis rather than the more convenient procedure of administering a fixed dose. Aims: The present post hoc analyses sought to determine whether the subjective effects of psilocybin are affected by body weight when psilocybin is administered on a weight-adjusted basis and when psilocybin is administered as a fixed dose. Methods: We analyzed acute subjective drug effects (mystical, challenging, and intensity) associated with therapeutic outcomes from ten previous studies (total N = 288) in which psilocybin was administered in the range 20 to 30 mg/70 kg (inclusive). Separate multivariate regression analyses examined the relationships between demographic variables including body weight and subjective effects in participants receiving 20 mg/70 kg (n = 120), participants receiving 30 mg/70 kg (n = 182), and participants whose weight-adjusted dose was about 25 mg (to approximate the fixed dose that is currently being evaluated in registration trials for major depressive disorder) (n = 103). Results: In the 20 mg/70 kg and 30 mg/70 kg weight-adjusted groups, and in the fixed dose group, no significant associations were found between subjective effects and demographic variables including body weight or sex. Across a wide range of body weights (49 to 113 kg) the present results showed no evidence that body weight affected subjective effects of psilocybin. Conclusions: These results suggest that the convenience and lower cost of administering psilocybin as a fixed dose outweigh any potential advantage of weight-adjusted dosing.",3,"[0.00040912770782597363, 0.0005920100957155228, 0.0020526933949440718, 0.9969461560249329]",3
1683,"Does ketamine mimic aspects of schizophrenic speech?.^\nSpeech disturbances are well-known symptoms contributing to the diagnosis of schizophrenia. Subanesthetic doses of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist ketamine have been reported to produce positive and negative symptoms and cognitive impairments consistent with those seen in schizophrenia. Insofar as this is true, it constitutes evidence that the NMDA system is involved in schizophrenia. It is therefore of interest to know whether ketamine produces speech disturbances like those of schizophrenia. Quantitative computer-aided analysis of apparently normal speech can detect clinically relevant changes and differences that are not noticeable to the human observer. Accordingly, in this study, speech samples were analysed for repetitiousness, idea density, and verb density using software developed by the authors. The samples came from two experiments, a within-subjects study of healthy volunteers given intravenous ketamine versus placebo, and a between-groups study of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and comparable healthy controls.Our primary hypothesis was that in both schizophrenia and ketamine, repetitiousness would increase, since perserverative speech is a well-known symptom of schizophrenia. Our secondary hypotheses were that in both schizophrenia and ketamine, idea density and verb density would decrease as indicators of cognitive impairment. The primary hypothesis was confirmed in the schizophrenia experiment (between groups) and the ketamine experiment (within subjects). The secondary hypotheses were disconfirmed except that in the ketamine experiment, verb density was significantly lowered. Reduced use of verbs apparently reflects a cognitive impairment of a different type than repetitiousness, and further investigation is needed to determine whether this impairment occurs in psychosis.",3,"[0.001516047865152359, 0.004973419010639191, 0.0013974735047668219, 0.9921131134033203]",3
719,"Ecstasy (MDMA) and high prevalence psychiatric symptomatology: Somatic anxiety symptoms are associated with polydrug, not ecstasy, use.^\nAlthough previous studies have examined anxiety and depression in ecstasy (±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine; MDMA) users, it remains unclear whether symptoms are associated specifically with ecstasy or with polydrug use in general. We compared mean symptomatology and clinically significant symptoms in 45 ecstasy polydrug, 48 cannabis polydrug and 40 legal drug users, who completed standardised self-report anxiety and depression symptom measures. We further examined whether group differences were secondary to increased somatic symptom reporting, which may reflect acute/subacute drug effects. Anxiety and depression scores were higher in polydrug than legal drug users, with no difference between ecstasy and cannabis groups. There was no difference in numbers meeting criteria for clinically significant depression or moderate or severe anxiety, but the polydrug group contained more individuals reporting at least mild anxiety symptoms than the legal drug control. Multivariate analyses indicated that anxiety alone was sufficient to discriminate groups. Polydrug users reported more somatic anxiety symptoms than legal drug users, but endorsed equivalent numbers of non-somatic symptoms. High prevalence psychiatric symptomatology in ecstasy polydrug users may be associated with polydrug rather than ecstasy use. Higher ratings in polydrug users appear to be secondary to increased somatic symptom reporting, suggesting possible impacts of drug effects on symptom endorsement. © 2010 British Association for Psychopharmacology.",3,"[0.0002790704893413931, 0.00044490204891189933, 0.0005000796518288553, 0.9987758994102478]",3

814,"Decision-making in chronic ecstasy users: a systematic review.^\nDifferent cognitive impairments have been reported as a result of long-term MDMA/ecstasy use. Increased impulsivity and altered decision-making have been shown to be associated with the development and maintenance of addictive disorders pointing toward the necessity to understand a potential impairment of decision-making due to MDMA use. Thus, assessing the long-term effects of MDMA is crucial in order to evaluate its controversially discussed therapeutic use. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the scientific literature on potential effects of chronic MDMA use on higher order decision-making processes in humans. Therefore, a systematic search for controlled trials relevant to the topic has been performed. Only studies using specific tasks on decision-making were included that involved subjects in the drug-free interval with drug-naïve, and/or polydrug control groups. A total of 12 studies could be identified that met the inclusion criteria, all of which were cross-sectional studies. The findings on decision-making disturbances in MDMA users were heterogeneous. Seven studies reported increased risky decisions, whereas five studies did not find MDMA-specific influences on decision-making. Increased impulsivity was observed both in MDMA groups and in (poly)drug control groups in almost all studies. Thus, the current state of research does not allow for the conclusion that long-term use of MDMA affects decision-making behavior in general.

The alteration of plasma VEGF concentrations did not differ between antianhedonic responders and non-responders at days 13 and 26 (all ps > 0.05). Additionally, no significant correlations were observed between the antianhedonic response to ketamine and plasma VEGF concentrations (all ps > 0.05). Conclusion: This preliminary study suggests that the antianhedonic effects of ketamine are not mediated by VEGF.

5047,"Baseline insomnia as a predictor of antidepressant efficacy to repeated intravenous ketamine for unipolar and bipolar depression: A preliminary study.^\nOBJECTIVE: Ketamine has been demonstrated to have robust and rapid antidepressant effects, and few studies have focused on the relationship between insomnia and the efficacy of ketamine. The objective of this study was to examine whether baseline insomnia predicted the antidepressant efficacy of repeated intravenous ketamine infusions for unipolar and bipolar depression. METHOD: Patients with high insomnia (n = 64) or low insomnia (n = 68) received six intravenous infusions of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min) over 12 days (Monday-Wednesday-Friday). The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) without sleep item was used to assess depressive symptoms. Response was defined as a MADRS total score ≥ 50%, and remission was defined as a MADRS total score ≤ 10. RESULT: There were no differences in response or remission rates between patients with high and low insomnia. However, the logistic regression model showed that high insomnia predicted an increased likelihood of response and remission. Cox proportional hazards models showed a reduced latency to respond and remit in patients with high insomnia. A linear mixed model showed that the high insomnia subgroup had greater improvement than the low insomnia subgroup (all p < 0.05). LIMITATION: The major limitation of this study is the open-label design. CONCLUSION: When given six ketamine infusions, patients with high insomnia were more likely to respond and remit than those with low insomnia. Patients with high insomnia showed not only a shorter latency to respond and remit, but also greater improvement than those with low insomnia.",3,"[0.00028612883761525154, 0.0004679371777456254, 0.0009166335803456604, 0.9983293414115906]",3
7370,"Learning and memory deficits in ecstasy users and their neural correlates during a face-learning task.^\nIt has been consistently shown that ecstasy users display impairments in learning and memory performance. In addition, working memory processing in ecstasy users has been shown to be associated with neural alterations in hippocampal and/or cortical regions as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Using functional imaging and a face-learning task, we investigated neural correlates of encoding and recalling face-name associations in 20 recreational drug users whose predominant drug use was ecstasy and 20 controls. To address the potential confounding effects of the cannabis use of the ecstasy using group, a second analysis included 14 previously tested cannabis users (Nestor, L., Roberts, G., Garavan, H., Hester, R., 2008. Deficits in learning and memory: parahippocampal hyperactivity and frontocortical hypoactivity in cannabis users. Neuroimage 40, 1328-1339). Ecstasy users performed significantly worse in learning and memory compared to controls and cannabis users. A conjunction analysis of the encode and recall phases of the task revealed ecstasy-specific hyperactivity in bilateral frontal regions, left temporal, right parietal, bilateral temporal, and bilateral occipital brain regions. Ecstasy-specific hypoactivity was evident in the right dorsal anterior cingulated cortex (ACC) and left posterior cingulated cortex. In both ecstasy and cannabis groups brain activation was decreased in the right medial frontal gyrus, left parahippocampal gyrus, left dorsal cingulate gyrus, and left caudate. These results elucidated ecstasy-related deficits, only some of which might be attributed to cannabis use. These ecstasy-specific effects may be related to the vulnerability of isocortical and allocortical regions to the neurotoxic effects of ecstasy. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

892,"Rejection and acceptance of LSD: Users and controls compared.^\nIn reviewing the natural history of LSD use, one is impressed with the rapid expansion of the size of the group which has taken the drug. Many individuals seem to be ready to have that sort of drug experience and, afterward, some become enthusiastic proselytizers. But their efforts to persuade others to take the drug do not always succeed; there are many individuals who are unwilling to try LSD. One is immediately curious. In what ways do those who resist taking LSD differ from those who are willing to take it? It is possible that these differences, if they can be isolated as variables, might be found to play an important role in impeding or facilitating the diffusion of other mind-altering drugs, alcohol or marijuana, for example. In the meantime, if one can set forth the variables which influence the acceptance or rejection of LSD, one has added to the understanding of the natural history of its use. We expected that resistance to LSD, defined as the refusal to take the drag when it was offered or a failure to pursue an opportunity to take the drug in circumstances where it was available, would depend upon four general sets of factors: the kind of information the person had about LSD effects in relationship to the kind of life experiences he was interested in having; the relationship of the potential receiver of LSD to the one offering it, including the evaluation of the latter by the former in terms of dominance, obligation, trustworthiness, and admiration; the life circumstances of the potential receiver in terms of general life satisfaction and distress; and the personality of the potential receiver, with special reference to ego control, flexibility, feelings of trust, and invulnerability. Interviews, observations, questionnaires, and participant interaction are productive research tools but do not provide a rigid experimental test of hypotheses. However, the hypotheses advanced have been of a rather general nature, and we think the method of inquiry fits the questions. The data do support a finding of consistent differences between persons who accept and reject LSD. Furthermore, drag-accepting behavior does appear to vary in the predicted direction with the kind of information a person possesses, with his or her relationship to the potential initiator in terms of power and status, with the personality of the person with reference to anxiety, ego control, and trust-distrust, and with the life circumstances of the person. More than these, a variety of other differences emerged which should be of considerable interest. Before reporting the findings, it is well to spend a moment on the control group employed. Its selection involved the same problems found in trying to obtain an LSD-using sample. We looked where we could to find people who had had the chance to take LSD and who had refused it. The best source of information was from LSD users themselves; they spoke of those who had rejected the drag. We inquired among persons already interviewed and among our acquaintances for leads to control subjects. In the end, we obtained a sample of forty-seven controls. We cannot contend that they are representative of all controls; we have no way of knowing how many people have had LSD offered to them, nor have we any way of knowing the characteristics of that population.

6679,"Human pharmacology of mephedrone: a dose-finding pilot study.^\nAims: Mephedrone is a synthetic cathinone included in the “Novel Psychoactive Substances” group. European epidemiological data showed a high prevalence of use. There are not experimental data in humans of the pharmacological effects of mephedrone. Objective was to obtain preliminary data on the effects of mephedrone and doses for future investigations. Methods: Nine healthy male, recreational users of psychostimulants, participated as outpatients in three different experimental sessions, in which one of the substances was administered each day. They received single oral doses of mephedrone (n = 3, 50 mg, 100mg and placebo; n = 3, 150 mg, 200mg and placebo; n = 3, 150 mg, 200mg and MDMA 100 mg). Drugs were administered doubleblind, and randomised (lower doses were allocated before higher doses for safety reasons in case of 150mg and 200 mg). Study variables included: vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, pupil diameter), subjective effects (visual analog scales‐VAS, ARCI‐ 49 item short form, VESSPA questionnaire), and blood and urine samples for pharmacokinetics. Results: Mephedrone produced effects at 150 and 200 mg, with dose‐related increases of blood pressure, heart rate and pupil diameter (but not temperature). Mephedrone produced more intense effects than MDMA. Mephedrone induced pleasurable effects (ARCI‐MBG, VAS “good effects”, VAS “liking”), and mild changes in perceptions but not hallucinations.

6173,"Food Effects on Bioavailability of MDMA in Healthy Volunteers.^\nThe sponsor has completed a Phase 3 study of MDMA‐assisted therapy for individuals diagnosed with severe PTSD demonstrating the safety and efficacy of this treatment. However, the effect of food intake on the absorption and bioavailability of orally administered MDMA is not yet well characterized. This phase I, open‐label, randomized sequence, multi‐dose, 2‐period crossover pharmacokinetic (PK) study assesses the effect of food on the relative bioavailability of MDMA. In addition, an increase in heart rate is anticipated following MDMA administration. Therefore, the secondary purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of food on the safety and tolerability of oral MDMA, as well as MDMA effects on ECG.

2117,"Ayahuasca improves emotion dysregulation in a community sample and in individuals with borderline-like traits.^\nBACKGROUND: Research suggests that mindfulness-based interventions may improve mindfulness-related capacities (e.g., decentering, non-judging, and non-reacting) and emotion regulation. Previously, our group reported that ayahuasca could be a potential analogue of mindfulness practice. The main aim of the current study was to examine the effects of ayahuasca on emotional regulation and mindfulness-related capacities. Secondarily, we sought to explore the effects of ayahuasca on individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) traits. METHOD: This is an observational study of 45 volunteers who participated in an ayahuasca session. The volunteers completed various self-report instruments designed to measure emotional dysregulation (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS)) and mindfulness traits (Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ)-Short Form and Experiences Questionnaire (EQ)) prior to and 24 h after the ayahuasca session. The volunteers were divided into two subgroups based on their score on the McLean Screening Instrument for BPD (MSI-BPD). Twelve participants were grouped into the BPD-like traits subgroup while the rest of them were included in the non-BPD-like subgroup. We performed within-subjects and between-group analyses. RESULTS: Overall, the participants showed significant improvements on the FFMQ subscales observing, acting with awareness, non-judging, and non-reacting and also significantly improved on decentering (EQ scale) and on the DERS subscales emotional non-acceptance, emotional interference, and lack of control. The BPD-like subgroup also showed significant improvements on the DERS subscales emotional interference and lack of control but not in mindfulness capacities. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a potential therapeutic effect for ayahuasca in emotion regulation and mindfulness capacities (including decentering, acceptance, awareness, and sensitivity to meditation practice). Based on these results, we believe that ayahuasca therapy could be of value in clinical populations, such as individuals with BPD, affected by emotion dysregulation.",3,"[0.0004725582548417151, 0.0015357632655650377, 0.0010720245772972703, 0.9969196319580078]",3
2031,"Evidence for chronically altered serotonin function in the cerebral cortex of female 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine polydrug users.^\nCONTEXT: MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, also popularly known as ""ecstasy"") is a popular recreational drug that produces loss of serotonin axons in animal models. Whether MDMA produces chronic reductions in serotonin signaling in humans remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether MDMA use is associated with chronic reductions in serotonin signaling in the cerebral cortex of women as reflected by increased serotonin(2A) receptor levels. DESIGN: Cross-sectional case-control study comparing serotonin(2A) receptor levels in abstinent female MDMA polydrug users with those in women who did not use MDMA (within-group design assessing the association of lifetime MDMA use and serotonin(2A) receptors). Case participants were abstinent from MDMA use for at least 90 days as verified by analysis of hair samples. The serotonin(2A) receptor levels in the cerebral cortex were determined using serotonin(2A)-specific positron emission tomography with radioligand fluorine 18-labeled setoperone as the tracer. SETTING: Academic medical center research laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 14 female MDMA users and 10 women who did not use MDMA (controls). The main exclusion criteria were nondrug-related DSM-IV Axis I psychiatric disorders and general medical illness. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cortical serotonin(2A) receptor nondisplaceable binding potential (serotonin(2A)BP(ND)). RESULTS: MDMA users had increased serotonin(2A)BP(ND) in occipital-parietal (19.7%), temporal (20.5%), occipitotemporal-parietal (18.3%), frontal (16.6%), and frontoparietal (18.5%) regions (corrected P < .05). Lifetime MDMA use was positively associated with serotonin(2A)BP(ND) in frontoparietal (β = 0.665; P = .007), occipitotemporal (β = 0.798; P = .002), frontolimbic (β = 0.634; P = .02), and frontal (β = 0.691; P = .008) regions. In contrast, there were no regions in which MDMA use was inversely associated with receptor levels. There were no statistically significant effects of the duration of MDMA abstinence on serotonin(2A)BP(ND). CONCLUSIONS: The recreational use of MDMA is associated with long-lasting increases in serotonin(2A) receptor density. Serotonin(2A) receptor levels correlate positively with lifetime MDMA use and do not decrease with abstinence. These results suggest that MDMA use produces chronic serotonin neurotoxicity in humans. Given the broad role of serotonin in human brain function, the possibility for therapeutic MDMA use, and the widespread recreational popularity of this drug, these results have critical public health implications.",3,"[0.0007126107811927795, 0.005771137308329344, 0.0038770439568907022, 0.989639163017273]",3

Various studies have investigated the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic relationship of LSD in healthy participants, but data on urinary recovery and confirmatory studies are missing. Methods: The present study characterized the pharmacokinetics, pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic relationship and urinary recovery of LSD at doses of 85 and 170 μg administered orally in 28 healthy participants. The plasma concentrations and subjective effects of LSD were continuously evaluated over a period of 24 h. Urine was collected during 3 time intervals (0–8, 8–16 and 16–24 h after LSD administration). Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using compartmental modelling. Concentration–subjective effect relationships were described using pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic modelling. Results: Mean (95% confidence interval) maximal LSD concentrations were 1.8 ng/mL (1.6–2.0) and 3.4 ng/mL (3.0–3.8) after the administration of 85 and 170 μg LSD, respectively. Maximal concentrations were achieved on average after 1.7 h. Elimination half-lives were 3.7 h (3.4–4.1) and 4.0 h (3.6–4.4), for 85 and 170 μg LSD, respectively. Only 1% of the administered dose was recovered from urine unchanged within the first 24 h, 16% was eliminated as 2-oxo-3-hydroxy-LSD. Urinary recovery was dose proportional. Mean (±standard deviation) durations of subjective effects were 9.3 ± 3.2 and 11 ± 3.7 h, and maximal effects (any drug effects) were 77 ± 18% and 87 ± 13% after 85 and 170 μg of LSD, respectively.

These trials found promising results for psychedelics versus placebo in several anxiety and depression scales but increases in blood pressure and heart rate also occurred. There were some concerns of risk of bias because it is difficult to truly randomize a psychedelic trial and there was a high percentage of patients in the trials who had used psychedelics in the past. There was high heterogeneity for all analyses that we could not explain.

5812,"Ecstasy (MDMA): Are the psychological problems associated with its use reversed by prolonged abstinence?.^\nRationale: Chronic, regular recreational use of ecstasy (MDMA) is associated with psychopathology, elevated behavioural impulsivity and persistent impairment of memory performance. Objective: The aim of the present study was to investigate which of these sequelae persist after at least 6 months of abstinence from ecstasy.Methods: Four groups of participants were compared: 18 current regular recreational ecstasy users, 15 ex-regular ecstasy users who had abstained from using the drug for an average of 2 years, 16 polydrug users who had never taken ecstasy and 15 drug-naive controls. Results: There were no significant group differences in age, education level, or pre-morbid intelligence and, generally, the use of illicit drugs other than ecstasy was not significantly different among the three drug-using groups. Both current and ex-ecstasy users exhibited elevated psychopathology and behavioural impulsivity compared with polydrug users and drug-naive controls, but current ecstasy users exhibited a broader range of psychopathology than ex-users. Both groups of ecstasy users also exhibited impaired working memory and verbal recall performance compared with drug-naive controls, but only ex-users exhibited impaired verbal recall relative to polydrug users. Regression analysis indicated that psychopathology was primarily predicted by the extent of previous consumption of cannabis rather than ecstasy, whereas the majority of the cognitive deficits were only predicted by the extent of previous ecstasy use. Conclusions: Selective impairments of neuro-psychological performance associated with regular ecstasy use are not reversed by prolonged abstinence.

Esketamine nasal spray (ESK) has been studied in several long-term trials of patients with TRD, including SUSTAIN-1 (NCT02493868) and SUSTAIN-3 (NCT02782104). This subgroup analysis of SUSTAIN-3 evaluated patients with TRD who received a second induction (IND) and maintenance treatment with ESK plus oral antidepressant (AD) after a relapse in SUSTAIN-1. METHODS: Patients aged 18-64 years who achieved stable remission or response with ESK and subsequently relapsed after randomization to continue ESK or switch to placebo nasal spray (PBO) in SUSTAIN-1 and entered the IND phase of SUSTAIN-3 were included in this interim analysis. Response (≥50% improvement in total score from baseline for Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] and Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item [PHQ-9]), remission (MADRS score ≤12; PHQ-9 total score <5), changes in depression rating scores (measured as mean change from baseline), and safety were evaluated (incidence of treatment-emergent and serious adverse events [AE]).

Methods: This study examined data from 6381 individuals reporting past-year hallucinogen use in the 2016–2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Logistic regression examined the association between the number of distinct hallucinogens used and psychosocial/behavioral risks, and latent class analysis (LCA) characterized subgroups of hallucinogen users. Results: The vast majority of hallucinogen users, roughly 70%, are not “specialists” who use only one hallucinogen type; rather, lifetime poly-hallucinogen use is the norm. Critically, however, we also see that important differences exist within the population of hallucinogen users—half (51%) could be classified as LSD-Mushroom-Ecstasy users only (this group was disproportionally comprised of youth), nearly one third (30%) were Poly-Hallucinogen users (this group was disproportionately male and non-Hispanic White), and smaller proportions were limited primarily to use of LSD-Mushrooms (6%; these individuals were almost exclusively ages 35 and older) or Ecstasy Only (12%; these individuals were mostly younger adults ages 18–34).

We report the findings of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-site phase 3 clinical trial (NCT03537014) to test the efficacy and safety of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted therapy for the treatment of patients with severe PTSD, including those with common comorbidities such as dissociation, depression, a history of alcohol and substance use disorders, and childhood trauma. After psychiatric medication washout, participants (n = 90) were randomized 1:1 to receive manualized therapy with MDMA or with placebo, combined with three preparatory and nine integrative therapy sessions. PTSD symptoms, measured with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5, the primary endpoint), and functional impairment, measured with the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS, the secondary endpoint) were assessed at baseline and at 2 months after the last experimental session. Adverse events and suicidality were tracked throughout the study. MDMA was found to induce significant and robust attenuation in CAPS-5 score compared with placebo (P < 0.0001, d = 0.91) and to significantly decrease the SDS total score (P = 0.0116, d = 0.43). The mean change in CAPS-5 scores in participants completing treatment was -24.4 (s.d. 11.6) in the MDMA group and -13.9 (s.d. 11.5) in the placebo group. MDMA did not induce adverse events of abuse potential, suicidality or QT prolongation. These data indicate that, compared with manualized therapy with inactive placebo, MDMA-assisted therapy is highly efficacious in individuals with severe PTSD, and treatment is safe and well-tolerated, even in those with comorbidities.

Ten patients also completed IATs assessing implicit suicidal associations at comparable time points. In a second study, nine patients received thrice-weekly ketamine infusions over a 12-day period. RESULTS: Twenty-four hours after a single infusion, MADRS-SI scores were reduced on average by 2.08 points on a 0 to 6 scale (p < .001; d = 1.37), and 81% of patients received a rating of 0 or 1 postinfusion.

7945,"Ketamine Infusion After Suicide Attempt: new Frontiers in Treating Acute Suicidality in a “real world” Medical Setting.^\nBackground/Significance: Suicide is a devastating public health crisis with few available treatments which quickly reduce the intensity of suicidality. In controlled, outpatient research settings, ketamine rapidly reduces suicidal thoughts as early as 2‐24 hours after a single infusion in patients with high suicide risk (Price 2014) ( Murrough 2015). In this IRB approved pilot study, we investigated ketamine’s effects on suicidality in a real‐world sample of recent suicide attempters at imminent risk of suicide on a tertiary‐care Consultation‐Liaison (CL) psychiatry service. Through administration of a “pre‐treatment” prior to psychiatric hospital transfer, we hypothesized ketamine would rapidly impact suicidal ideation in patients who attempted suicide and synergistically confer enduring benefits to behavioral therapies. Methods: In an open‐label design, we recruited 16 transdiagnostic patients,18‐65 years old to receive a single dose of intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) in the acute medical setting, after CL consultation and informed consent. All were psychiatrically hospitalized post‐infusion. Baseline suicidality and depression measures [Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale, Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale, Adult Suicide Ideation Questionnaire, hopelessness (via Cognitive Triad Inventory)] were compared to 24‐hours, 5‐days, 12‐days, and 1‐ and 3‐months post‐infusion using paired t‐tests. Results: Across all measures, rapid, statistically significant decreases (p’s<.001) were observed with large to very large effect sizes (Cohen’s d’s: 1.7‐8.8) at acute timepoints (24‐hour; 5‐day). These large gains were also uniformly maintained during follow‐up, continuously out to 3‐months post‐infusion. Discussion: Ketamine rapidly and robustly reduced suicidal symptoms in an ultra‐high‐risk, heterogeneous, “real world” sample. Combined with standard care, ketamine might also synergistically enhance the durability of benefit observed following discharge, consistent with a growing literature examining ketamine as a pre‐treatment to behavioral therapies ( Dakwar 2020). In forthcoming analyses, we will compare 6‐ and 12‐month rates of suicide re‐attempt and re‐hospitalization in ketamine‐treated patients to a matched case‐control sample of suicide attempters who did not receive ketamine pre‐treatment. Conclusion/Implications: Ketamine infusion is a safe, feasible, and viable method to rapidly reduce suicidality among patients admitted to the medical hospital after suicide attempt, and could also have enduring benefits. By advancing knowledge of novel treatment methods in real‐world clinical services through completion of further studies, ketamine could become an important and novel tool in the treatment of high‐risk CL patients.

3147,"Do Acute Experiences During Ketamine Infusions Influence its Antidepressant Effects?.^\nBackground: Sub‐anesthetic doses of the glutamate modulator, ketamine, induce highly variable dissociative and psychedelic experiences, followed by rapid and sustained antidepressant effects. Attempts to understand its therapeutic mechanism have largely focused on biological and dissociative effects. However, recent studies with ketamine and serotonergic psychedelics suggest that anxiety and positive affect during psychoactive periods may be relevant to clinical outcomes. Methods: We did a mediation analysis using a linear mixed effects model of clinician and self‐ratings of 76 patients’ experiences during ketamine infusions across two randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, crossover trials. We examined patients’ scores on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM‐A), Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for positive‐affect, adverse event reporting of euphoria, and VAS for anxiety, hypothesizing that they would mediate patients’ Montgomery‐ Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)‐measured response 24hrs and seven days after infusion. We hypothesized that less anxiety and greater positive‐affect would be associated with better antidepressant responses. Results: None of our measures during ketamine infusions mediated MADRS scores on Day one or seven. Though there were trend‐level associations between all measures with day‐one MADRS scores, these diminished by day seven and were also present during placebo infusions, suggesting a possible placebo effect. VAS positive‐affect scores seemed to track unblinding, suggesting positive‐affect is a common effect in ketamine antidepressant therapy, but precluding meaningful interpretation of these data. Conclusions: Such results may be preliminary evidence that ketamine’s psychoactive effects have little clinical value, but prospective examination of better validated psychological constructs in controlled trials with active placebos will be necessary for more definitive evidence.

Pubmed was searched by one doctoral-level researcher using specific Boolean operator terms. The results were filtered by title and abstract and 76 articles were screened and analyzed in full detail. Oral psilocybin is showing itself to be clinically efficacious by producing statistically significant reductions in depression and anxiety symptoms over time versus control in multiple clinical trials. It has also been shown to reduce cigarettes per day and drinks per day in patients with substance use disorders.

6160,"Precision Functional Brain Mapping in Psilocybin.^\nPsilocybin shows promise as a safe, transformational therapeutic across several psychiatric conditions. However, little is know about its mechanism of action. This study aims to establish a neuroimaging paradigm for use in future clinical research testing the effectiveness of psilocybin in various clinical applications. In this study, we will assess both acute (during psilocybin exposure) and sustained (one week post‐exposure) effects of 5‐HT2A receptor agonism on brain circuits using resting state functional connectivity and precision functional mapping (PFM). Using a randomized, controlled crossover study design, a small number of healthy volunteers will receive either psilocybin or methylphenidate (MTP) and will undergo MRI (structural, task, blood flow, extended resting state). After two weeks, participants will return for a second exposure with the alternate of what they received in the first session. This study involves up to five separate imaging sessions. Functional connectivity will be measured using the following PFM approach: 1. Extended functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) image acquisition 2. Aggressive data cleaning 3. Analysis designed to examine functional brain connectivity at the individual level This will allow us to map the effects of 5‐HT2A receptor agonism on cortical and cortico‐subcortical brain networks at the individual level with precision that is unparalleled in the current literature. This is the first step in developing a precision neuroimaging approach for mechanistic understanding of psilocybin's therapeutic effects.

1631,"Factors associated with Ecstasy use in Turkish students.^\nAIMS: The purpose of this study was to establish the factors associated with Ecstasy use in secondary school students in Turkey. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a survey of a representative sample drawn from cities in different geographical regions in Turkey in 1998 and 2001. The questionnaire was administered to a total of 18,556 and 11,911 10th-grade students in 1998 and 2001, respectively. MEASUREMENTS: The questionnaire administered in the study was adapted from the questionnaires used in 'Monitoring the Future' study in the United States and ESPAD (the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs). It included questions about demographic characteristics, family characteristics, school life, social contacts and use of substances. FINDINGS: While the percentage of those who used Ecstasy at least once in their life-times was 2.65% in 1998, the figure reached 3.31% in 2001. Male gender, older age, use of alcohol, cannabis, heroin and cocaine, non-medical use of psychotherapeutic drugs and participation in a meeting concerning the adverse effects of substance use were found to be significant variables predicting 'ever use' of Ecstasy in both years by logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Ecstasy use, while low in Turkey, appears to be on the increase and follows a pattern in terms of correlates that is similar to other illicit drugs.

4988,"Use of ketamine and esketamine for depression: an overview of systematic reviews with meta-analyses.^\nPURPOSE: To summarize the evidence of efficacy and safety of the use of ketamine and esketamine for depression. METHODS: A literature search was performed in Medline, the Cochrane Library, LILACS, and CRD until November 2020. We included systematic reviews with meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials on the use of ketamine and esketamine in adult patients with depression. Two authors independently performed the study selection and data extraction. The AMSTAR-2 tool was used to appraise the quality of included reviews. RESULTS: A total of 118 records were identified, and 11 studies fully met the eligibility criteria. Compared to control, ketamine improved the clinical response at 40 min to 1 week and clinical remission at 80 min to 72 h, and esketamine improved both outcomes at 2 h to 4 weeks. Ketamine and esketamine also had a beneficial effect on the depression scales score and suicidality. For adverse events, oral ketamine did not show significant change compared to control, while intranasal esketamine showed difference for any events, such as dissociation, dizziness, hypoesthesia, and vertigo. Most reviews were classified as ""critically low quality,"" and none of them declared the source of funding of the primary studies and assessed the potential impact of risk of bias in primary studies. CONCLUSION: Ketamine and esketamine showed a significant antidepressant action within a few hours or days after administration; however, the long-term efficacy and safety are lacking.

5556,"Individual differences in distress, impulsivity, and coping motives for use as predictors of problematic ecstasy use.^\nBackground: Ecstasy users who report problematic use of ecstasy experience adverse social, psychological, and health-related consequences not reported by non-problem users. Relatively little is known about the risk factors for the development of problematic ecstasy use. Such information would be valuable for targeted intervention, prevention, and education Aims: The current study aimed to fill this gap by investigating several hypothesised risk factors for problematic use and the relationships between them. Methods: Self-reported impulsivity, psychological distress, sex, and coping motives for ecstasy use were investigated as predictors of problematic ecstasy use in a cross-sectional online survey. Results: The sample consisted of 483 individuals (60.5% male, 38.3% female, 1.2% other) aged 18–62 years, reporting ecstasy use on an average of 59.7 occasions (SD = 167.8). Both higher self-reported impulsivity and psychological distress predicted problem ecstasy use, and both these relationships were partially mediated by coping motives. When these variables were examined in a combined mediation model accounting for their covariance, psychological distress still predicted problematic use partially via an effect on coping motives, while impulsivity showed only a direct effect on problem use. No sex differences in problem ecstasy use were observed. Conclusions: Increased trait impulsivity and psychological distress appear to confer greater risk of problematic ecstasy use. Targeting these factors, as well as coping motives for ecstasy use, may be useful in efforts to prevent and reduce problematic ecstasy use among those who use the drug.",3,"[0.000254734797636047, 0.0004232362553011626, 0.0007514242897741497, 0.9985705614089966]",3
7083,"Exploring the effect of microdosing psychedelics on creativity in an open-label natural setting.^\nINTRODUCTION: Taking microdoses (a mere fraction of normal doses) of psychedelic substances, such as truffles, recently gained popularity, as it allegedly has multiple beneficial effects including creativity and problem-solving performance, potentially through targeting serotonergic 5-HT(2A) receptors and promoting cognitive flexibility, crucial to creative thinking. Nevertheless, enhancing effects of microdosing remain anecdotal, and in the absence of quantitative research on microdosing psychedelics, it is impossible to draw definitive conclusions on that matter. Here, our main aim was to quantitatively explore the cognitive-enhancing potential of microdosing psychedelics in healthy adults. METHODS: During a microdosing event organized by the Dutch Psychedelic Society, we examined the effects of psychedelic truffles (which were later analyzed to quantify active psychedelic alkaloids) on two creativity-related problem-solving tasks: the Picture Concept Task assessing convergent thinking and the Alternative Uses Task assessing divergent thinking. A short version of the Ravens Progressive Matrices task assessed potential changes in fluid intelligence. We tested once before taking a microdose and once while the effects were expected to be manifested. RESULTS: We found that both convergent and divergent thinking performance was improved after a non-blinded microdose, whereas fluid intelligence was unaffected. CONCLUSION: While this study provides quantitative support for the cognitive-enhancing properties of microdosing psychedelics, future research has to confirm these preliminary findings in more rigorous placebo-controlled study designs. Based on these preliminary results, we speculate that psychedelics might affect cognitive metacontrol policies by optimizing the balance between cognitive persistence and flexibility. We hope this study will motivate future microdosing studies with more controlled designs to test this hypothesis.",3,"[0.0017472079489380121, 0.011524719186127186, 0.0024386162403970957, 0.9842894673347473]",3
8470,"Comparability of blinded remote and site-based assessments of response to adjunctive esketamine or placebo nasal spray in patients with treatment resistant depression.^\nFunctional unblinding due to treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) may occur with any investigational drug and poses a challenge for double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. This pilot study compared site-based Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores to remote, site-independent scores by blinded raters. Audio-digital recordings of site-based MADRS interviews were obtained from a subset of patients during a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of esketamine nasal spray or placebo spray in treatment resistant depression (Clinical Trials Registration: NCT01998958). Fourteen of 67 patients (21%) in the ITT population were randomly selected from 3 clinical trial sites. The site-based MADRS interviews were recorded at the baseline and 2 h post-dose assessments on the first intranasal dosing day. Site-independent raters scored the recordings and were blinded to treatment and all reported TEAEs, including any transient dissociative/perceptual symptoms. None of the 7 placebo-assigned patients achieved a treatment response or remission at the 2-h post-dose assessment. Four of the 7 esketamine-assigned patients (57.1%) achieved a treatment response at 2-h post-dose, and 3 patients (42.9%) achieved remission. Three esketamine-treated patients experienced transient dissociative symptoms. The remote site-independent raters essentially replicated the site-based MADRS scores and yielded a 92.9% predictive value for matching treatment response and remission rates. This small pilot study affirms that blinded remote ratings (without the likelihood of functional unblinding) are comparable to site-based ratings of efficacy of esketamine nasal spray.

6085,"Ibogaine in the Treatment of Alcoholism: a Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Escalating-dose, Phase 2 Trial.^\nApproximately 5% of the world's adult population has some alcohol‐related disorder, which in addition is associated with 3% of all deaths in the world. In Brazil, harmful use and dependence on alcohol reach about 10% of the population, with alcohol being one of the main factors of disease and mortality. Although the medications currently used have some efficacy, the adverse effects and relatively long time of treatment are factors that may reduce patients' motivation to continue taking the medication correctly. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct research with new drugs for the treatment of alcoholism. Ibogaine is an alkaloid present in the bush Tabernanthe iboga (iboga), a plant from Central Africa traditionally used in countries such as Gabon and Cameroon. Animal studies and case series suggest that one or a few doses of ibogaine significantly reduce withdrawal symptoms and the intensity of use of various drugs, including opioids, psychostimulants, and alcohol. However, there are no controlled clinical studies that have explored these effects. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of increasing doses of ibogaine in 12 alcoholic patients.

793,"Subjective and Behavioral Effects of Microdoses of LSD in Healthy Human Volunteers.^\nBackground: There have been numerous anecdotal reports that very low doses of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) reduce depressed mood and improve positive outlook. Yet, the effects of such “microdoses” have not been tested under double‐blind, placebo‐controlled conditions. As a first step, we examined the subjective and behavioral effects of single low doses of LSD in healthy adults. Methods: Volunteers (N=20) attended four laboratory sessions during with they received placebo, 6.5μg, 13μg, or 26μg LSD in randomized order. During expected peak drug effect, they completed mood questionnaires and behavioral tasks assessing emotion processing, including i) recognition of emotional facial expressions and ii) responses to simulated social rejection. Results: LSD dose‐dependently increased ratings of “feeling” the drug, “liking” the drug, and “feeling high,” in addition to dose‐dependently increasing responses to the Altered States of Consciousness questionnaire. The highest dose of LSD increased vigor, elation, and anxiety on the Profile of Mood States. On the emotion recognition task, LSD enhanced participants’ ability to recognize both anger and happiness. During the simulated social rejection task, LSD increased participants’ desire to play again with the other players, but did not affect their perception of the degree to which they were included or excluded. Conclusions: These findings with non‐symptomatic volunteers suggest that “microdoses” of LSD have dose‐dependent effects on mood and emotional behavior. These results set the stage for measuring the clinical efficacy of the drug in the treatment of depressed mood, and help to understand the expanding use of low doses of LSD in the community.

METHODS: Two similarly-designed, short-term TRANSFORM trials randomized adults to esketamine or matching placebo nasal spray, each with a newly-initiated oral antidepressant, for 4 weeks (TRANSFORM-1: N = 342 patients; TRANSFORM-2: N = 223 patients). The factor structure of MADRS item scores at baseline was determined by exploratory factor analysis in TRANSFORM-2 and corroborated by confirmatory factor analysis in TRANSFORM-1. Change in MADRS factor scores from baseline (day 1) to the end of the 28-day double-blind treatment phase of TRANSFORM-2 was analyzed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM). RESULTS: Three factors were identified based on analysis of MADRS items: Factor 1 labeled affective and anhedonic symptoms (apparent sadness, reported sadness, lassitude, inability to feel), Factor 2 labeled anxiety and vegetative symptoms (inner tension, reduced sleep, reduced appetite, concentration difficulties), and Factor 3 labeled hopelessness (pessimistic thoughts, suicidal thoughts). The three-factor structure observed in TRANSFORM-2 was verified in TRANSFORM-1.

A.L. was treated for 8 weeks on an inpatient psychiatric unit and for 8 weeks as an outpatient. To the authors knowledge, this this is the first report of an OCD patient being treated with intranasal ketamine, the first treated with multiple ketamine administrations, and the first treated with intensive ERP and repeated ketamine administrations. It is of course impossible, in examination of this single case, to determine whether ketamine and intensive CBT synergized to produce clinical benefit. It is possible that the patient benefited solely from inpatient CBT. Indeed, improvements in OCD symptoms were seen after 2 weeks of CBT and before ketamine was administered. These improvements may have also resulted from the lack of pertinent obsessive-compulsive triggers on the inpatient unit. Nonetheless, there are several reasons to believe that the patient benefited from ketamine: He reported additional symptom reductions following the initiation of ketamine treatments (this may have also been due to continued CBT). Compliance with response prevention drastically improved shortly after beginning ketamine, suggesting that ketamine may augment the process of ERP for OCD, and the patient reported rapid and drastic reductions in suicidal ideation following the first week of ketamine treatments. Further examination of the concurrent use of ketamine and extinction-based ERP for OCD is warranted.

We investigated subjective effects (self-rated any drug effect, good drug effect, bad drug effect, and anxiety), blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, duration of the acute LSD response, acute (12 h) and subacute (24 h) adverse effects, reports of flashbacks, and liver and kidney function before and after the studies. RESULTS: LSD dose-dependently increased subjective, physiologic, and adverse effects. The dose-response curves for the proportions of subjects with a certain amount of a subjective effect were steeper and reached a higher maximum for positive acute subjective effects compared with negative acute subjective effects. Maximal ratings of > 50% good drug effects were reached in 37%, 91%, 96%, and 91% of the LSD administrations at 25, 50, 100, and 200 µg. Maximal ratings of > 50% bad drug effects were reached in 0%, 9%, 27%, 31% at 25, 50, 100, and 200 µg, respectively. Mean ratings of Oceanic Boundlessness were 10%, 25%, 41%, and 44%, and mean ratings of Anxious Ego-Dissolution were 3.4%, 13%, 20%, and 22% at 25, 50, 100, and 200 µg, respectively. The physiologic effects of LSD were moderate. None of the subjects had systolic blood pressure > 180 mmHg at any time. Peak heart rate > 100 beats/min was observed in 0%, 6%, 20%, and 25% of the subjects at 25, 50, 100, and 200 µg, respectively. Maximal heart rates of 129 and 121 beats/min were observed in one subject at the 50 and 200 µg doses, respectively. Peak body temperature > 38° was observed in 0%, 11%, 7%, and 34% at 25, 50, 100, and 200 µg, respectively. Mean acute adverse effect scores on the List of Complaints were 5.6, 9.2, 12, and 13 at 25, 50, 100, and 200 µg, respectively. Kidney and liver function parameters were unaltered.

3662,"Subanesthetic dose of ketamine decreases prefrontal theta cordance in healthy volunteers: implications for antidepressant effect.^\nBACKGROUND: Theta cordance is a novel quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) measure that correlates with cerebral perfusion. A series of clinical studies has demonstrated that the prefrontal theta cordance value decreases after 1 week of treatment in responders to antidepressants and that this effect precedes clinical improvement. Ketamine, a non-competitive antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, has a unique rapid antidepressant effect but its influence on theta cordance is unknown. METHOD: In a double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled experiment we studied the acute effect of ketamine (0.54 mg/kg within 30 min) on theta cordance in a group of 20 healthy volunteers. RESULTS: Ketamine infusion induced a decrease in prefrontal theta cordance and an increase in the central region theta cordance after 10 and 30 min. The change in prefrontal theta cordance correlated with ketamine and norketamine blood levels after 10 min of ketamine infusion. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that ketamine infusion immediately induces changes similar to those that monoamineric-based antidepressants induce gradually. The reduction in theta cordance could be a marker and a predictor of the fast-acting antidepressant effect of ketamine, a hypothesis that could be tested in depressive patients treated with ketamine.",3,"[0.000756921130232513, 0.0016016634181141853, 0.0007368413498625159, 0.9969045519828796]",3
2301,"Long-term outcomes of psychoactive drug use in trauma patients: A multicenter patient-reported outcomes study.^\nINTRODUCTION: Psychoactive drug use (PDU) is reported in up to 40% of trauma patients and is associated with a higher rate of in-hospital complications. However, little is known about its long-term impact on trauma patients. We aimed to assess the long-term functional, mental, and psychosocial outcomes of PDU in trauma patients 6 to 12 months after injury. METHODS: Trauma patients with moderate to severe injuries (Injury Severity Score, >9) who had a toxicology screen upon admission to one of three level 1 trauma centers were contacted by phone 6 to 12 months postinjury. Psychoactive drug use was defined as the presence of a psychoactive, nonprescribed substance on toxicology screen including amphetamine, barbiturate, benzodiazepine, cannabinoid, methamphetamine, methadone, opioid, oxycodone, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy), phencyclidine, tricyclic antidepressant, and cocaine. The interviews systematically evaluated functional limitations, social functioning, chronic pain, and mental health (posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety). Patients with a score of ≤47 on the Short-Form Health Survey version 2.0 social functioning subdomain were considered to have social dysfunction. Multivariable regression models were built to determine the independent association between PDU and long-term outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 1,699 eligible patients, 571 (34%) were included in the analysis, and 173 (30.3%) screened positive for PDU on admission. Patients with PDU were younger (median age [interquartile range], 43 [28-55] years vs. 66 [46-78] years, p < 0.001), had more penetrating injuries (8.7% vs. 4.3%, p = 0.036), and were less likely to have received a college education (41.3% vs. 54.5%, p = 0.004). After adjusting for patients' characteristics including the presence of a baseline psychiatric comorbidity, patients with PDU on admission were more likely to suffer from daily chronic pain, mental health disorders, and social dysfunction 6 to 12 months after injury. There was no difference in the functional limitations between patients with and without PDU. CONCLUSION: On the long term, PDU in trauma patients is strongly and independently associated with worse mental health, more chronic pain, and severe impairment in social functioning. A trauma hospitalization presents an opportunity to identify patients at risk and to mitigate the long-term impact of PDU on recovery.

1770,"Glycine transporter inhibitor attenuates the psychotomimetic effects of ketamine in healthy males: preliminary evidence.^\nEnhancing glutamate function by stimulating the glycine site of the NMDA receptor with glycine, D-serine, or with drugs that inhibit glycine reuptake may have therapeutic potential in schizophrenia. The effects of a single oral dose of cis-N-methyl-N-(6-methoxy-1-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ylmethyl) amino-methylcarboxylic acid hydrochloride (Org 25935), a glycine transporter-1 (GlyT1) inhibitor, and placebo pretreatment on ketamine-induced schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms, perceptual alterations, and subjective effects were evaluated in 12 healthy male subjects in a randomized, counter-balanced, within-subjects, crossover design. At 2.5 h after administration of the Org 25935 or placebo, subjects received a ketamine bolus and constant infusion lasting 100 min. Psychotic symptoms, perceptual, and a number of subjective effects were assessed repeatedly before, several times during, and after completion of ketamine administration. A cognitive battery was administered once per test day. Ketamine produced behavioral, subjective, and cognitive effects consistent with its known effects. Org 25935 reduced the ketamine-induced increases in measures of psychosis (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)) and perceptual alterations (Clinician Administered Dissociative Symptoms Scale (CADSS)). The magnitude of the effect of Org 25935 on ketamine-induced increases in Total PANSS and CADSS Clinician-rated scores was 0.71 and 0.98 (SD units), respectively. None of the behavioral effects of ketamine were increased by Org 25935 pretreatment. Org 25935 worsened some aspects of learning and delayed recall, and trended to improve choice reaction time. This study demonstrates for the first time in humans that a GlyT1 inhibitor reduces the effects induced by NMDA receptor antagonism.

MDMArelated ED admissions were analyzed over a 7-month period and the records of all PIC calls were reviewed. Results: There were 52 (age 15-44 years, 32 males) ecstasy-related ED admissions during the study period. Most (68%) admissions presented to the ED at night, 52% on weekends and 44% consumed the drug at clubs and parties. Forty-six percent of the patients took between 1/2 to 3 tablets and 29 patients (56%) had taken ecstasy before. Twenty-two subjects (42%) reported poly-drug use. Fifteen subjects (29%) required hospitalization, six of them (11%) to the intensive care unit. The most common manifestations were restlessness, agitation, disorientation, shaking, high blood pressure, headache and loss of consciousness. More serious complications were hyperthermia, hyponatremia, rhabdomyolysis, brain edema and coma. Conclusion: The image of ecstasy as a safe party drug is spurious.

2490,"Real-world effectiveness of repeated ketamine infusions for treatment-resistant bipolar depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Clinical trials have demonstrated rapid antidepressant effects with intravenous (IV) ketamine for major depressive disorder, with relatively less research specifically for bipolar depression. Herein, we describe the real-world effectiveness of repeated ketamine infusions for treatment-resistant bipolar depression. METHODS: This study was conducted in a community clinic in Mississauga, Ontario (Canadian Rapid Treatment Centre of Excellence; Braxia Health). In this observational study (NCT04209296), patients with treatment-resistant bipolar I/II depression (n = 66) received four sub-anesthetic doses of IV ketamine (0.5-0.75 mg/kg) over a two-week period. Symptoms of depression, suicidality, anxiety, and functioning were assessed with validated self-report measures. RESULTS: Statistically and clinically significant antidepressant effects were observed in the overall sample, as measured by the Quick Inventory for Depression Symptomatology-Self Report-16 (QIDS-SR(16) ) with further reductions in depressive symptoms observed after each subsequent infusion (n = 66; mean QIDS-SR(16) reduction of 6.08+/-1.39; p < 0.0001). Significant reductions of suicidal thoughts (QIDS-SR(16) -Suicide Item) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) were also observed with functional improvements on the Sheehan Disability Scale (p < 0.0001 on all measures). Moreover, the response rate (QIDS-SR(16) total score decrease ≥50% from baseline) was 35% and remission rate (QIDS-SR(16) total score ≤5) was 20% after four infusions. Infusions were generally well tolerated with treatment-emergent hypomania observed in only three patients (4.5%) with zero cases of mania or psychosis.

4982,"Emotion regulation among psychostimulants drug users at techno parties.^\nAim: Deficits in the communication and identifying of feelings are usually observed in substance abuse. Research in several countries has reported sensation seeking and alexithymia implication in addiction. According to a cognitive-developmental model of emotional experience proposed, alexithymia is a deficit in the cognitive processing of emotion that can be seen as an impairment in the ability to consciously experience feeling in the context of autonomic activation indicate of emotional arousal. The primary objective of this study was to identify certain personality dimensions linked with emotions' regulation, i.e. Zuckerman's sensation seeking, alexithymia, and emotional awareness in ecstasy and cocaine users at techno parties. Methods: Subjects were divided in two groups: 37 male ecstasy or cocaine abusers, and 37 male non-drug users. We hypothesized that ecstasy and cocaine users would exhibit high levels of sensation seeking (high level of sensation seeking,), and emotional dysregulation (high level of alexithymia and depression, low level of emotional awareness). The methodology comprised a questionnaire developed for the study, designed to record sociodemographic data and evaluate psychoactive substance use, the MlINI (mini international psychiatric interview), the Zuckerman 40-item Sensation Seeking Scale (SSS-IV), the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), the Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale (LEAS), and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-13). Subjects were recruited during rave-parties. Results: The results showed significantly higher sensation seeking scores for ecstasy and cocaine users for the score total and the disinhibition and experience seeking subdimensions. Ecstasy and cocaine abusers exhibited higher TAS-20 and BDI-13 scores and lower levels of emotional awareness than non-drug users. No correlation between the TAS-20 and depression symptomatology emerged. No significant correlations were found between LEAS and TAS-20. Conclusion: These results provide new elements concerning the profile of drug users at techno parties and illustrate the changing practices of ecstasy use. The LEAS and the TAS-20 were not intercorrelated; it seems plausible that they reflect two sides of the emotional states self-report.

9419,"Cognitive and motor effects of NMDA antagonist ketamine in healthy individuals with a family history of alcoholism.^\nThe cognitive and motor effects of alcohol drinking are influenced by a family history of alcoholism. Some data suggest that individuals with a family history of alcoholism(family history positive [FHP]) are less affected and intoxicated by alcohol, as compared to those without such a history (family history negative [FHN]). Our group has used ketamine as a pharmacological probe to study alcoholism, since (a) both alcohol and ketamine inhibit N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor function and (b) ketamine has alcohol‐like effects. The purpose of the study was to evaluate cognitive and motor effects of ketamine in FHP and FHN subjects. Ninety‐nine non‐alcohol‐dependent healthy subjects with (FHP; n = 29) and without a family history of alcoholism(FHN; n = 70) were recruited. The subjects weremales and females aged 21 to 30 years who had no lifetime Axis I psychiatric or substance use disorders. In this randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, crossover study, subjects received either intravenous ketamine (0.81 mg/kg) or placebo (saline) during two separate test sessions scheduled 3 days apart. Cognitive function was evaluated by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test. Motor coordination function was evaluated by the Grooved Pegboard Test. During the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, ketamine impaired both total recall (medication effect: p < 0.0001) and delayed recall (medication effect: p < 0.0001) compared with placebo. There was a statistical trend (family history x medication effect: p = 0.0667) showing that FHP subjects (placebo: 10.3; ketamine: 7.7) were less impaired than FHN subjects (placebo: 10.2; ketamine: 6.2) in delayed recall after ketamine infusion.

However, these effects have been difficult to demonstrate under placebocontrolled conditions. Methods: We conducted a double‐blind controlled study examining effects of repeated doses of LSD (13 or 26 μg) or placebo, in healthy adults. Participants were randomly assigned to receive placebo (N = 18), 13 μg LSD (N = 19), or 26 μg LSD(N = 19) during four 5‐hour laboratory sessions, separated by 3‐4 days. They also attended by a drug‐free followup session 3‐4 days after their last session. We assessed mood and subjective states, cognitive and emotional function, and cardiovascular function during the drug sessions and at followup. Results: LSD produced small increases in ratings of 'feeling a drug effect', including both stimulant‐like and LSD‐like effects, especially during the first administration of the drug. The drug produced few effects on emotion or psychomotor tasks or measures of heart rate or pressure, and no residual effects were detected on the drug‐free followup session. Conclusions: We conclude that repeated low doses of LSD are safe and that the repeated dosing design is feasible for future studies, but under these conditions the drug produces negligible changes in mood or cognition.

5525,"Strategies to Prolong Ketamine's Efficacy in Adults with Treatment-Resistant Depression.^\nINTRODUCTION: Ketamine treatment is capable of significant and rapid symptom improvement in adults with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). A limitation of ketamine treatment in TRD is the relatively short duration of time to relapse (e.g., median 2-4 weeks). The objective of the systematic review herein is to identify strategies capable of prolonging the acute efficacy of ketamine in adults with TRD. METHODS: PubMed/MEDLINE databases were searched from inception to December 2020 for clinical studies written in English using the following key terms: ketamine, prolong, and depression. A total of 454 articles were identified from the literature search which included all clinical studies regarding prolonging the antidepressant effects of ketamine. Twenty-two articles were included: ten randomized controlled trials (RCTs), eight prospective open-label trials, one retrospective chart review, and three case reports. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used for data extraction. The primary outcome was prolonged effect, defined as statistically significant antidepressant effects following acute ketamine treatment. RESULTS: A total of 454 articles were identified, and 22 articles were included. Different treatment modalites including pharmacological interventions, manualized-based psychotherapies, electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and intravenous monotherapy were examined to determine their impact on the prolongation of antidepressant effects following acute ketamine treatment. No treatment modality, other than repeat-dose IV ketamine, has demonstrated ability to significantly prolong the acute efficacy of IV ketamine in TRD. CONCLUSION: Hitherto, available open-label data and controlled trial data support repeat administration of IV ketamine as an effective strategy to prolong the efficacy of ketamine's antidepressant effects (although not the focus of the study herein, maintenance repeat-dose esketamine treatment is proven effective in esketamine responders).

Clonidine is a centrally acting alpha2‐receptor agonist and sympatholytic which attenuates the release of NE from presynaptic nerve terminals and also lowers NE plasma concentration. To determine the role of NE in the response to MDMA in humans we test the effects of a clonidine pretreatment on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of MDMA. We use a randomized double‐blind placebo‐controlled cross‐over design with four experimental sessions. Clonidine (150 μg) or placebo will be administered 1 h before the administration of MDMA (125 mg) or placebo to 16 healthy volunteers. Subjective and cardiovascular responses will be repeatedly assessed throughout the experiments and plasma samples are collected for pharmacokinetics. We hypothesize that clonidine will significantly attenuate predominantly the cardiovascular response to MDMA.",1,"[0.003066783770918846, 0.9737105369567871, 0.002525473013520241, 0.020697159692645073]",3

394,"Ketamine study: Protocol for naturalistic prospective multicenter study on subcutaneous ketamine infusion in depressed patients with active suicidal ideation.^\nBACKGROUND: Psychiatric disorders are associated with more than 90% of reported suicide attempts worldwide, but few treatments have demonstrated a direct effect in reducing suicide risk. Ketamine, originally an anesthetic, has been shown anti-suicide effects in clinical trials designed to treat depression. However, changes at the biochemical level were assessed only in protocols of ketamine with very limited sample sizes, particularly when the subcutaneous route was considered. In addition, the inflammatory changes associated with ketamine effects and their correlation with response to treatment, dose-effect, and suicide risk warrant further investigation. Therefore, we aimed to assess whether ketamine results in better control of suicidal ideation and/or behavior in patients with depressive episodes and whether ketamine affects psychopathology and inflammatory biomarkers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report here the design of a naturalistic prospective multicenter study protocol of ketamine in depressive episodes carried out at Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA) and Hospital Moinhos de Vento (HMV). The study was planned to recruit adult patients with Major depressive disorder (MDD) or Bipolar disorder (BD) types 1 or 2, who are currently in a depressive episode and show symptoms of suicidal ideation and/or behavior according to the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) and have been prescribed ketamine by their assistant psychiatrist. Patients receive ketamine subcutaneously (SC) twice a week for 1 month, but the frequency can be changed or the dose decreased according to the assistant physician's decision. After the last ketamine session, patients are followed-up via telephone once a month for up to 6 months. The data will be analyzed using repeated measures statistics to evaluate the reduction in suicide risk as a primary outcome, as per C-SSRS. DISCUSSION: We discuss the need for studies with longer follow-ups designed to measure a direct impact on suicide risk and that additional information about the safety and tolerability of ketamine in particular subset of patients such as those with depression and ideation suicide. In line, the mechanism behind the immunomodulatory effects of ketamine is still poorly understood.

2913,"Ecstasy use and depression: A 4-year longitudinal study among an Australian general community sample.^\nRationale: Longitudinal, population-based studies can better assess the relationship of ecstasy use with depression. Objectives: We examined whether change in ecstasy use was associated with change in depressive symptoms/probable depression over a 4-year period, among a large Australian sample. Methods: The Personality and Total Health project is a longitudinal general community study of Australians from Canberra and Queanbeyan. Data from the youngest cohort when aged 24-30 (N = 2, 128) and 4 years later (N = 1, 977) was included. The Goldberg depression scale and the Brief Patient Health Questionnaire measured depressive symptoms and probable depression, respectively. Multilevel growth models also considered demographics, psychosocial characteristics, and other drug use. Results: Ecstasy use was not associated with long-term depressive symptoms or greater odds of depression in multivariate analyses. Users had more self-reported depressive symptoms when using ecstasy compared to not using. However, differences between people who had and had not ever used ecstasy largely accounted for this. Other factors were more important in the prediction of depression. Conclusions: It would be premature to conclude that ecstasy use is not related to the development of long-term depressive symptoms, given the relatively low level of ecstasy and other drug use in this community sample. Results showed that other factors need to be considered when investigating ecstasy use and depression. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",1,"[0.013036207295954227, 0.5736671686172485, 0.04651326313614845, 0.3667832612991333]",3

However, MDMA is also being investigated as a new medication for the treatment of post‐traumatic stress disorder. This study was designed to characterize the subjective effects of MDMA in healthy volunteers. Methods: The present pooled analysis included data from nine randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, cross‐over studies in a total of 162 healthy subjects (82 females) receiving a single dose of 125 mg of MDMA. Outcome measures included the five Dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness scale (5D‐ASC) administered once after the drug effect, and a series of visual analogue scales (VASs) administered repeatedly during the drug effect to assess the area under the effect‐time curve (AUEC0‐6h). Outcome values are reported as differences from placebo (Δ). Sex differences were assessed after correcting for MDMA plasma concentration. Results: MDMA significantly increased the scores of all subscales on the 5D‐ASC. However, the effects of MDMA on the 5D‐ASC were rather small (Δ5D‐ASC total score, % mean±SD] 13±11; p<.001) with most distinct effects in the subscales blissful state and experience of unity (Δrating score, %mean±SD: 37±32 and 21±26, respectively; both p<.001).

8345,"Prediction of MDMA response in healthy humans: a pooled analysis of placebo-controlled studies.^\nBACKGROUND: 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""ecstasy"") is used both recreationally and therapeutically. Little is known about the factors influencing inter- and intra-individual differences in the acute response to MDMA. Effects of other psychoactive substances have been shown to be critically influenced by personality traits and mood state before intake. METHODS: We pooled data from 10 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over studies performed in the same laboratory in 194 healthy subjects receiving doses of 75 or 125mg of MDMA. We investigated the influence of drug dose, body weight, sex, age, drug pre-experience, genetics, personality and mental state before drug intake on the acute physiological and psychological response to MDMA. RESULTS: In univariable analyses, the MDMA plasma concentration was the strongest predictor for most outcome variables. When adjusting for dose per body weight, we found that (a) a higher activity of the enzyme CYP2D6 predicted lower MDMA plasma concentration, (b) a higher score in the personality trait ""openness to experience"" predicted more perceived ""closeness"", a stronger decrease in ""general inactivation"", and higher scores in the 5D-ASC (5 Dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness Questionnaire) scales ""oceanic boundlessness"" and ""visionary restructuralization"", and (c) subjects with high ""neuroticism"" or trait anxiety were more likely to have unpleasant and/or anxious reactions. CONCLUSIONS: Although MDMA plasma concentration was the strongest predictor, several personality traits and mood state variables additionally explained variance in the response to MDMA.

1647,"Synaptic potentiation is critical for rapid antidepressant response to ketamine in treatment-resistant major depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Clinical evidence that ketamine, a nonselective N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, has therapeutic effects within hours in people suffering from depression suggests that modulating glutamatergic neurotransmission is a fundamental step in alleviating the debilitating symptoms of mood disorders. Acutely, ketamine increases extracellular glutamate levels, neuronal excitability, and spontaneous γ oscillations, but it is unknown whether these effects are key to the mechanism of antidepressant action of ketamine. METHODS: Twenty drug-free major depressive disorder patients received a single, open-label intravenous infusion of ketamine hydrochloride (.5 mg/kg). Magnetoencephalographic recordings were made approximately 3 days before and approximately 6.5 hours after the infusion, whereas patients passively received tactile stimulation to the right and left index fingers and also while they rested (eyes-closed). Antidepressant response was assessed by percentage change in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale scores. RESULTS: Patients with robust improvements in depressive symptoms 230 min after infusion (responders) exhibited increased cortical excitability within this antidepressant response window. Specifically, we found that stimulus-evoked somatosensory cortical responses increase after infusion, relative to pretreatment responses in responders but not in treatment nonresponders. Spontaneous somatosensory cortical γ-band activity during rest did not change within the same timeframe after ketamine in either responders or nonresponders. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest NMDAR antagonism does not lead directly to increased cortical excitability hours later and thus might not be sufficient for therapeutic effects of ketamine to take hold. Rather, increased cortical excitability as depressive symptoms improve is consistent with the hypothesis that enhanced non-NMDAR-mediated glutamatergic neurotransmission via synaptic potentiation is central to the antidepressant effect of ketamine.",3,"[0.00026272519608028233, 0.0004731541557703167, 0.000558324798475951, 0.9987057447433472]",3

If participants continued regular use of ecstasy in this period, they were asked to participate in the second stage of the research 6 months later. Thirty-five subjects attended the second stage of the study, 5 of which were excluded because they had less than 5 drug experiences during the last 6 months.

The Non-Drug Group was most likely to choose ""God"" as the best descriptor of that which was encountered while the psychedelic groups were most likely to choose ""Ultimate Reality."" Although there were some other differences between non-drug and the combined psychedelic group, as well as between the four psychedelic groups, the similarities among these groups were most striking. Most participants reported vivid memories of the encounter experience, which frequently involved communication with something having the attributes of being conscious, benevolent, intelligent, sacred, eternal, and all-knowing. The encounter experience fulfilled a priori criteria for being a complete mystical experience in approximately half of the participants. More than two-thirds of those who identified as atheist before the experience no longer identified as atheist afterwards. These experiences were rated as among the most personally meaningful and spiritually significant lifetime experiences, with moderate to strong persisting positive changes in life satisfaction, purpose, and meaning attributed to these experiences.

Since 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy shows promise as a treatment for other anxiety disorders, a blinded, placebo-controlled pilot study was conducted. OBJECTIVES: To explore feasibility and safety of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for reduction of social fear and avoidance that are common in the autistic population. METHODS: Autistic adults with marked to very severe social anxiety were randomized to receive MDMA (75 to 125 mg, n = 8) or inactive placebo (0 mg, n = 4) during two 8-h psychotherapy sessions (experimental sessions) in a controlled clinical setting. Double-blinded experimental sessions were spaced approximately 1 month apart with 3 non-drug psychotherapy sessions following each. The primary outcome was change in Leibowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) Total scores from Baseline to one month after the second experimental session. Outcomes were measured again six months after the last experimental session. RESULTS: Improvement in LSAS scores from baseline to the primary endpoint was significantly greater for MDMA group compared to the placebo group (P = 0.037), and placebo-subtracted Cohen's d effect size was very large (d = 1.4, CI - 0.074, 2.874).

8870,"Oxytocin receptor gene variations and socio-emotional effects of MDMA: A pooled analysis of controlled studies in healthy subjects.^\nMethylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) increases oxytocin, empathy, and prosociality. Oxytocin plays a critical role in emotion processing and social behavior and has been shown to mediate the prosocial effects of MDMA in animals. Genetic variants, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) may influence the emotional and social effects of MDMA in humans. The effects of common genetic variants of the OXTR (rs53576, rs1042778, and rs2254298 SNPs) on the emotional, empathogenic, and prosocial effects of MDMA were characterized in up to 132 healthy subjects in a pooled analysis of eight double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. In a subset of 53 subjects, MDMA produced significantly greater feelings of trust in rs1042778 TT genotypes compared with G allele carriers. The rs53576 and rs225498 SNPs did not moderate the subjective effects of MDMA in up to 132 subjects. None of the SNPs moderated MDMA-induced impairments in negative facial emotion recognition or enhancements in emotional empathy in the Multifaceted Empathy Test in 69 subjects. MDMA significantly increased plasma oxytocin concentrations. MDMA and oxytocin concentrations did not differ between OXTR gene variants. The present results provide preliminary evidence that OXTR gene variations may modulate aspects of the prosocial subjective effects of MDMA in humans.

4971,"Which neuroreceptors mediate the subjective effects of MDMA in humans? A summary of mechanistic studies.^\nIn preclinical studies, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'Ecstasy') has been shown to release serotonin (5-HT), dopamine and norepinephrine. However, the role of these neurotransmitters and their corresponding receptor sites in mediating the subjective effects of MDMA has not yet been studied in humans. Therefore, we investigated the effects of three different neuroreceptor pretreatments on the subjective, cardiovascular and adverse effects of MDMA (1.5 mg/kg orally) in 44 healthy human volunteers. Pretreatments were: the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram (40 mg intravenously) in 16 subjects, the 5-HT(2) antagonist ketanserin (50 mg orally) in 14 subjects, and the D(2) antagonist haloperidol (1.4 mg intravenously) in 14 subjects. Each of these studies used a double-blind placebo-controlled within-subject design and all subjects were examined under placebo, pretreatment, MDMA and pretreatment plus MDMA conditions. Citalopram markedly reduced most of the subjective effects of MDMA, including positive mood, increased extraversion and self-confidence. Cardiovascular and adverse effects of MDMA were also attenuated by citalopram. Haloperidol selectively reduced MDMA-induced positive mood but had no effect on other subjective effects of MDMA or the cardiovascular or adverse responses to MDMA. Ketanserin selectively reduced MDMA-induced perceptual changes and emotional excitation. These results indicate that the overall psychological effects of MDMA largely depend on carrier-mediated 5-HT release, while the more stimulant-like euphoric mood effects of MDMA appear to relate, at least in part, to dopamine D(2) receptor stimulation. The mild hallucinogen-like perceptual effects of MDMA appear to be due to serotonergic 5-HT(2) receptor stimulation.

4826,"Differential effects of rumination and distraction on ketamine induced modulation of resting state functional connectivity and reactivity of regions within the default-mode network.^\nDistraction and rumination are distinct response styles that determine how an individual deals with negative thoughts and feelings. Rumination is accompanied by an elevated self-focus, which is associated with increased resting state functional connectivity and decreased reactivity within the default mode network. Interestingly, the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine reduces functional connectivity in this network, while its effects on blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses during stimulus perception are not known. Ketamine might lead to a more variable processing of the external world with an attenuated self-focus by reducing the resting state connectivity. Here, we used an emotional picture-viewing task in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging to test the hypothesis that a single ketamine administration to healthy subjects increases BOLD reactivity to negative stimuli. We found a region specific increase in BOLD reactivity in the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex and not in a posterior control region after ketamine compared with placebo administration. Moreover, a linear regression revealed that the increase in BOLD reactivity was more pronounced for subjects with a low ability to apply distraction during negative experiences. Our results implicate that ketamine attenuates a potentially pathological increased self-focus during negative experiences.

8101,"P300-mediated modulations in self-other processing under psychedelic psilocybin are related to connectedness and changed meaning: A window into the self-other overlap.^\nThe concept of self and self-referential processing has a growing explanatory value in psychiatry and neuroscience, referring to the cognitive organization and perceptual differentiation of self-stimuli in health and disease. Conditions in which selfhood loses its natural coherence offer a unique opportunity for elucidating the mechanisms underlying self-disturbances. We assessed the psychoactive effects of psilocybin (230 μg/kg p.o.), a preferential 5-HT1A/2A agonist known to induce shifts in self-perception. Our placebo-controlled, double-blind, within-subject crossover experiment (n = 17) implemented a verbal self-monitoring task involving vocalizations and participant identification of real-time auditory source- (self/other) and pitch-modulating feedback. Subjective experience and task performance were analyzed, with time-point-by-time-point assumption-free multivariate randomization statistics applied to the spatiotemporal dynamics of event-related potentials. Psilocybin-modulated self-experience, interacted with source to affect task accuracy, and altered the late phase of self-stimuli encoding by abolishing the distinctiveness of self- and other-related electric field configurations during the P300 timeframe. This last effect was driven by current source density changes within the supragenual anterior cingulate and right insular cortex. The extent of the P300 effect was associated with the intensity of psilocybin-induced feelings of unity and changed meaning of percepts. Modulations of late encoding and their underlying neural generators in self-referential processing networks via 5-HT signaling may be key for understanding self-disorders. This mechanism may reflect a neural instantiation of altered self-other and relational meaning processing in a stimulus-locked time domain. The study elucidates the neuropharmacological foundation of subjectivity, with implications for therapy, underscoring the concept of connectedness.",3,"[0.0002601444721221924, 0.0004199228133074939, 0.00046938005834817886, 0.9988505840301514]",3
9452,"A randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 1 study to evaluate the effects of TAK-063 on ketamine-induced changes in fMRI BOLD signal in healthy subjects.^\nRationale: Phosphodiesterase 10A inhibitor TAK-063 has shown effects that suggest efficacy in schizophrenia treatment. Objective: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, incomplete-crossover study investigated effects of single oral administration of TAK-063 on ketamine-induced changes in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal in healthy males. Methods: Healthy men aged 18 to 45 years with normal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and electroencephalogram measurements at screening were eligible. Each subject was randomized to one of nine treatment schedules: all subjects received placebo and two of three doses of TAK-063 followed by ketamine. The primary endpoint was ketamine-induced brain activity in select regions of the brain during resting state. Secondary endpoints included pharmacokinetic parameters of TAK-063, proportion of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), and percentage of subjects meeting criteria for abnormal safety laboratory tests and vital sign measurements. Results: The study comprised 27 subjects. Prior to ketamine infusion, TAK-063 exerted region-specific effects on resting state functional MRI (fMRI) BOLD signal. After ketamine administration, TAK-063 reduced the Cohen’s effect size for resting-state fMRI BOLD signal in key brain regions examined, and exerted similar effects on BOLD signal during the working memory task across all doses. TAK-063 was safe and well tolerated. Conclusions: Our results are consistent with non-clinical studies of ketamine and TAK-063 and clinical studies of ketamine and risperidone. It is unknown whether these data are predictive of potential antipsychotic efficacy, and further analyses are required.
