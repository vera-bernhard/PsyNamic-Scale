777,"Antidepressant effects of ketamine in depressed patients.^\nBACKGROUND: A growing body of preclinical research suggests that brain glutamate systems may be involved in the pathophysiology of major depression and the mechanism of action of antidepressants. This is the first placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial to assess the treatment effects of a single dose of an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist in patients with depression. METHODS: Seven subjects with major depression completed 2 test days that involved intravenous treatment with ketamine hydrochloride (.5 mg/kg) or saline solutions under randomized, double-blind conditions. RESULTS: Subjects with depression evidenced significant improvement in depressive symptoms within 72 hours after ketamine but not placebo infusion (i.e., mean 25-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores decreased by 14 +/- SD 10 points vs. 0 +/- 12 points, respectively during active and sham treatment). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a potential role for NMDA receptor-modulating drugs in the treatment of depression.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.006436342839151621, 0.9857571721076965, 0.015539336018264294, 0.0045455507934093475]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
6103,"A Multi-Site Study of MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy for PTSD.^\nPTSD is a serious debilitating disorder that negatively impacts a person's daily life. PTSD is a stress‐related psychiatric condition that may occur following a traumatic event such as war, disaster, sexual abuse, violence, terrorism, and accidents. PTSD negatively impacts a person's daily life, resulting in relationship difficulties, difficulty in finding and maintaining a job, reduced cognitive and psychosocial functioning, substance abuse, high‐cost healthcare use, and increased depression and suicide risk. Available PTSD treatments, including medications and therapy, effectively treat only a fraction of people who try them for adequate dose and duration. People with PTSD can be treated with psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies. In the past decade, there has been a growing amount of research into medications and other methods that may augment the effectiveness of psychotherapy for PTSD 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a drug that releases serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain and indirectly increases levels of the neurohormones oxytocin, arginine vasopressin and cortisol. The combined neurobiological effects of MDMA increase compassion, reduce defenses and fear of emotional injury, and enhance communication and introspection. MDMA produces anxiolytic and prosocial effects, which counteract avoidance and hyperarousal in the context of therapy. A combined treatment of MDMA and psychotherapy may be especially useful for treating PTSD. This multi‐site, double‐blind, randomized Phase 3 study assesses the efficacy and safety of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy versus psychotherapy with placebo control in participants diagnosed with at least severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The study will be conducted in N ≈ 100 participants. Participants will be enrolled in one of two groups at a 1:1 ratio. A flexible dose of MDMA or placebo, followed by a supplemental half‐dose unless contraindicated, is administered during the Treatment Period with manualized psychotherapy in three monthly Experimental Sessions. This 12‐week Treatment Period is preceded by three Preparatory Sessions. During the Treatment Period, each Experimental Session is followed by three Integrative Sessions of non‐drug psychotherapy. The Primary Outcome measure is change in Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM 5 (CAPS‐5) from Baseline. Exploratory measures will address specific symptoms, or behavior that is sometimes related to PTSD. Drug safety will be assessed by measuring blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature during experimental sessions, collecting adverse events and measuring suicidal thoughts or behaviors with the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS). This study will compare the effects of three manualized Experimental Sessions of psychotherapy supported by assisted by flexible doses of MDMA versus placebo. Initial doses per Experimental Session include 80 mg or 120 mg of MDMA compounded with mannitol and magnesium stearate or placebo alone (mannitol and magnesium stearate), followed 1.5 to 2 hours later by a supplemental half‐dose (40 or 60 mg).

8889,"Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.006505465600639582, 0.9888764023780823, 0.014250049367547035, 0.0048624263145029545]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1829,"Reduction in social anxiety after MDMA-assisted psychotherapy with autistic adults: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study.^\nRATIONALE: Standard therapeutic approaches to reduce social anxiety in autistic adults have limited effectiveness. Since 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy shows promise as a treatment for other anxiety disorders, a blinded, placebo-controlled pilot study was conducted. OBJECTIVES: To explore feasibility and safety of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for reduction of social fear and avoidance that are common in the autistic population. METHODS: Autistic adults with marked to very severe social anxiety were randomized to receive MDMA (75 to 125 mg, n = 8) or inactive placebo (0 mg, n = 4) during two 8-h psychotherapy sessions (experimental sessions) in a controlled clinical setting. Double-blinded experimental sessions were spaced approximately 1 month apart with 3 non-drug psychotherapy sessions following each. The primary outcome was change in Leibowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) Total scores from Baseline to one month after the second experimental session. Outcomes were measured again six months after the last experimental session. RESULTS: Improvement in LSAS scores from baseline to the primary endpoint was significantly greater for MDMA group compared to the placebo group (P = 0.037), and placebo-subtracted Cohen's d effect size was very large (d = 1.4, CI - 0.074, 2.874). Change in LSAS scores from baseline to 6-month follow-up showed similar positive results (P = 0.036), with a Cohen's d effect size of 1.1 (CI - 0.307, 2.527). Social anxiety remained the same or continued to improve slightly for most participants in the MDMA group after completing the active treatment phase. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot trial demonstrated rapid and durable improvement in social anxiety symptoms in autistic adults following MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. Initial safety and efficacy outcomes support expansion of research into larger samples to further investigate this novel treatment for social anxiety.

2153,"Effects of ayahuasca on the endocannabinoid system of healthy volunteers and in volunteers with social anxiety disorder: Results from two pilot, proof-of-concept, randomized, placebo-controlled trials.^\nOBJECTIVE: To assess endocannabinoid (anandamide, AEA; 2-arachidonoylglycerol, 2-AG) plasma levels in healthy volunteers and in volunteers with social anxiety disorder (SAD) after a single oral dose of ayahuasca or placebo. METHODS: Post hoc analysis of endocannabinoid plasma levels (baseline, 90 and 240 min after drug intake) from two parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled trials. In Study 1, 20 healthy volunteers ingested ayahuasca (average 1.58 mg/ml dimethyltryptamine (DMT)) or placebo, and in Study 2, 17 volunteers with SAD received ayahuasca (average 0.680 mg/ml DMT) or placebo. RESULTS: A significant difference was observed in AEA concentrations in Study 2 after ayahuasca intake (Χ(2) (2) = 6.5, p = 0.03, Friedman test), and near significant differences (increases) were observed between baseline and 90 (Z = 0, p = 0.06, Wilcoxon test) and 240 (Z = 10, p = 0.06) minutes after ayahuasca intake. CONCLUSIONS: Although our findings suggest that ayahuasca could modulate AEA levels in SAD patients, the high interindividual variability in both trials and the small samples preclude definitive conclusions. More research with larger samples is needed to better understand the effects of ayahuasca and other hallucinogens in the endocannabinoid system.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.005183079745620489, 0.9855853915214539, 0.016617948189377785, 0.004498119466006756]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
2482,"Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of low dose lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in healthy older volunteers.^\nResearch has shown that psychedelics, such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), have profound anti-inflammatory properties mediated by 5-HT(2A) receptor signaling, supporting their evaluation as a therapeutic for neuroinflammation associated with neurodegenerative disease. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of orally repeated administration of 5 μg, 10 μg, and 20 μg LSD in older healthy individuals. In the current paper, we present safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic measures that relate to safety, tolerability, and dose response. METHODS: This was a phase 1 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study. Volunteers were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 dose groups (5 μg, 10 μg, 20 μg LSD, and placebo), and received their assigned dose on six occasions (i.e., every 4 days). RESULTS: Forty-eight older healthy volunteers (mean age = 62.9 years) received placebo (n = 12), 5 μg (n = 12), 10 μg (n = 12), or 20 μg (n = 12) LSD. LSD plasma levels were undetectable for the 5 μg group and peak blood plasma levels for the 10 μg and 20 μg groups occurred at 30 min. LSD was well tolerated, and the frequency of adverse events was no higher than for placebo. Assessments of cognition, balance, and proprioception revealed no impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest safety and tolerability of orally administered 5 μg, 10 μg, and 20 μg LSD every fourth day over a 21-day period and support further clinical development of LSD for the treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD).","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.006649374961853027, 0.9893891215324402, 0.014597194269299507, 0.004847378004342318]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

This modified double-blind study investigated the safety, tolerability, and clinical effects of psilocybin, a potent 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A/2C) agonist, in patients with OCD. METHOD: Nine subjects with DSM-IV-defined OCD and no other current major psychiatric disorder participated in up to 4 single-dose exposures to psilocybin in doses ranging from sub-hallucinogenic to frankly hallucinogenic. Low (100 microg/kg), medium (200 microg/kg), and high (300 microg/kg) doses were assigned in that order, and a very low dose (25 microg/kg) was inserted randomly and in double-blind fashion at any time after the first dose. Testing days were separated by at least 1 week. Each session was conducted over an 8-hour period in a controlled environment in an outpatient clinic; subjects were then transferred to a psychiatric inpatient unit for overnight observation. The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) and a visual analog scale measuring overall obsessive-compulsive symptom severity were administered at 0, 4, 8, and 24 hours post-ingestion. The Hallucinogen Rating Scale was administered at 8 hours, and vital signs were recorded at 0, 1, 4, 8, and 24 hours after ingestion. The study was conducted from November 2001 to November 2004. RESULTS: Nine subjects were administered a total of 29 psilocybin doses. One subject experienced transient hypertension without relation to anxiety or somatic symptoms, but no other significant adverse effects were observed. Marked decreases in OCD symptoms of variable degrees were observed in all subjects during 1 or more of the testing sessions (23%-100% decrease in YBOCS score). Repeated-measures analysis of variance for all YBOCS values revealed a significant main effect of time on Wilks lambda (F = 9.86, df = 3,3; p = .046), but no significant effect of dose (F = 2.25, df = 3,3; p = .261) or interaction of time and dose (F = 0.923, df = 9,45; p = .515).

We will define the signs and symptoms of sleep disruption and time course of alterations in ADH levels and neurocognitive function occurring after administration of a single dose of MDMA in experienced users. The immediate effects of MDMA include euphoria and intoxication; at 24 hours after MDMA these positive effects are replaced by lowered mood and lethargy ‐ we refer to these effects as a discontinuation syndrome. The pleasurable effects of MDMA are thought to be due to elevations of serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine; the mechanisms of post‐MDMA depression are unknown but may be due to relative serotonin depletion. Among its many functions serotonin maintains normal sleep architecture. The effects of MDMA discontinuation on sleep architecture will be assessed using comprehensive polysomnography and wrist actigraphy with measures obtained 36 hours after a single dose of MDMA. Cognitive measurements will explore the acute effects of MDMA. MDMA can produce hyponatremia.

7425,"The effect of polymorphism at the serotonin transporter gene on decision-making, memory and executive function in ecstasy users and controls.^\nRationale: 3, 4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ""ecstasy"") is a popular drug of abuse known to result in depletions of the serotonin (5-HT) system. A number of studies have reported that ecstasy users differ from controls on a variety of measures of cognitive function. However, the literature is not consistent and many negative findings were also reported. One reason for such inconsistency might be interindividual variance in vulnerability to the deleterious effects of ecstasy due to a number of factors, both genetic and environmental. Objectives: To investigate the hypothesis that carriers of the s allele at the 5-HT transporter gene-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR), which was associated with reduced serotonergic neurotransmission relative to the l allele, would be most vulnerable to the effects of ecstasy on cognitive function. Methods: We assessed memory, decision-making, and executive function in ecstasy users and controls, stratifying by genotype at the 5-HTTLPR. Results: We observed that the 5-HTTLPR genotype groups differed on a number of measures in both the ecstasy users and the controls. While performing a risky decision-making task, ss and ls controls attended to differences in the probability of winning chosen gambles to a greater extent than the ll controls. However, this difference was dramatically attenuated in the ss ecstasy users. Furthermore, independent of ecstasy use, volunteers of the ss genotype outperformed the ll genotype on a visual planning task. Conclusions: The results are consistent with the hypothesis that cognitive impairment in ecstasy users may depend on genetic variation at the 5-HTTLPR. © Springer-Verlag 2006.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.004684378392994404, 0.9824732542037964, 0.017686763778328896, 0.005122893024235964]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
8611,"Cytokine- and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-Related Gene-Based Genome-Wide Association Study of Low-Dose Ketamine Infusion in Patients with Treatment-Resistant Depression.^\nBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Ketamine may work as an anti-inflammatory agent, and it increases the levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in patients with treatment-resistant depression. However, whether genes related to pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and VEGF may predict the treatment response to ketamine remains unknown.Therefore the aim of this study was to analyze whether specific genes related to inflammatory processes and VEGF were associated with treatment response to low-dose ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant depression. METHODS: Based on the genome data from our clinical trial, this study was a secondary analysis of candidate genes correlated with different timepoints of depressive symptoms. In total, 65 patients with treatment-resistant depression (n = 21 for ketamine 0.5 mg/kg, 20 for ketamine 0.2 mg/kg, and 24 for normal saline) were genotyped for 684,616 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Genes associated with 80 cytokines (i.e., interleukin [IL]-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and adiponectin) and VEGF (i.e., VEGF and VEGF receptors) were selected for the gene-based genome-wide association study on the antidepressant effect of a ketamine infusion. RESULTS: Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms, including rs2540315 and rs75746675 in IL1R1 and rs79568085 in VEGFC, were related to the rapid (within 240 min) antidepressant effect of a ketamine infusion; specific single nucleotide polymorphisms, such as Affx-20131665 in PIGF and rs8179353, rs8179353, and rs8179353 in TNFRSF8, were associated with the sustained (up to 2 weeks) antidepressant effect of low-dose (combined 0.5 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg) ketamine. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings further revealed that genes related to both anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, C-reactive protein, and adiponectin) and VEGF-FLK signaling predicted the treatment response to a ketamine infusion in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The synergic modulation of inflammatory and VEGF systems may contribute to the antidepressant effect of ketamine.

Oxytocin plays a critical role in emotion processing and social behavior and has been shown to mediate the prosocial effects of MDMA in animals. Genetic variants, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) may influence the emotional and social effects of MDMA in humans. The effects of common genetic variants of the OXTR (rs53576, rs1042778, and rs2254298 SNPs) on the emotional, empathogenic, and prosocial effects of MDMA were characterized in up to 132 healthy subjects in a pooled analysis of eight double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. In a subset of 53 subjects, MDMA produced significantly greater feelings of trust in rs1042778 TT genotypes compared with G allele carriers. The rs53576 and rs225498 SNPs did not moderate the subjective effects of MDMA in up to 132 subjects. None of the SNPs moderated MDMA-induced impairments in negative facial emotion recognition or enhancements in emotional empathy in the Multifaceted Empathy Test in 69 subjects. MDMA significantly increased plasma oxytocin concentrations. MDMA and oxytocin concentrations did not differ between OXTR gene variants. The present results provide preliminary evidence that OXTR gene variations may modulate aspects of the prosocial subjective effects of MDMA in humans.

221,"Effects of ketamine anesthesia on efficacy, tolerability, seizure response, and neurocognitive outcomes in electroconvulsive therapy: A comprehensive meta-analysis of double-blind randomized controlled trials.^\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) remains the most effective treatment for major depressive disorder. Ketamine is an anesthetic gaining attention for its rapid antidepressant effect. Numerous randomized controlled trials have investigated the effect of ketamine anesthesia in ECT on various clinical outcomes. Previous systematic reviews have not found benefit for overall depression response, although some have found evidence of benefit early in the ECT course. Clear quantitative conclusions have not been established regarding other outcomes, particularly while only using data from high-quality studies. We aimed to examine all data from double-blind randomized controlled trials comparing ketamine to other anesthetics via meta-analysis, to make recommendations regarding ECT practice and future research. Data were extracted for depressive symptoms, seizure duration and electrical dose, neuropsychological performance, and adverse effects. Effect sizes were calculated using Hedge's g and odds ratios. Eighteen studies (n = 915) were included in the meta-analysis. Ketamine was not found to enhance improvement of depressive symptoms, either early in ECT course or at end of study. Ketamine had a large effect on increasing seizure duration both overall (Hedge's g = 0.71, P = 0.038) and in the subgroup receiving ketamine in combination with another anesthetic (Hedge's g = 0.78, P < 0.01), and on decreasing electrical dose (Hedge's g = 1.98, P = 0.039). There was no significant effect of ketamine on any individual neuropsychological domain. Ketamine was not associated with increased adverse effects, except for hypertension in patients receiving ketamine monotherapy. Significant heterogeneity was present for many outcomes, and sensitivity analyses suggested a relation to methodological variation in most cases. This study supports the finding that ketamine does not enhance ECT's antidepressant effect, including on early improvement, but provides substantial evidence for enhancing seizure duration and reducing electrical dose. No significant benefit was found on neurocognitive outcomes, but analysis was limited by small sample sizes and high heterogeneity. Ketamine is generally safe in ECT, particularly as a coanesthetic. Our findings provide meta-analytic support to the recommendations in ECT clinical guidelines for use of coadjuvant ketamine in ECT where seizures are suboptimal. Further studies targeting neurocognitive outcomes are encouraged.

Our study sought to evaluate longitudinal changes in SI and a more subtle manifestation, desire for hastened death (DHD), after psilocybin intervention in patients with cancer. Methods: This study entailed a secondary analysis of data collected in a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, crossover‐design trial of psilocybin (0.3mg/kg) versus active placebo (niacin 250mg) in conjunction with psychotherapy in participants with cancer (n=29). Of those who endorsed SI at baseline (n = 11), roughly half were randomized to the psilocybin‐first PF (n=6) versus niacin‐first NF (n=5) groups. SI was assessed by summing scores on the suicidality items on the Beck Depression Inventory‐II and the Brief Symptom Inventory. DHD was assessed by combining two items from the Demoralization Scale. Results: After the first medication session, prior to crossover, the NF group exhibited no within‐group change in SI compared to baseline. However, the PF group showed significant within‐group reduction in SI from baseline to all three pre‐crossover time points (p<0.001). Post‐crossover, at 6.5‐month follow‐up, both groups showed significant reductions in SI compared to baseline (p<0.005). We found no between‐group differences in DHD prior to the first medication session. However, the PF group endorsed significantly less DHD after the first medication session prior to crossover (p<0.01). Post‐crossover, the combined groups showed significant reductions in DHD compared to baseline at three time points (p<0.005). Conclusions: Our results support the hypothesis that a single dose of psilocybin may have rapid and persisting anti‐suicidal properties in patients with cancer.

1444,"Efficacy of low-dose ketamine infusion in anxious vs nonanxious depression: revisiting the Adjunctive Ketamine Study of Taiwanese Patients with Treatment-Resistant Depression.^\nBACKGROUND: The antidepressant effect of low-dose ketamine infusion on Taiwanese patients with anxious vs nonanxious treatment-resistant depression (ANX-TRD vs NANX-TRD) has remained unknown. METHODS: In total, 71 patients with TRD were randomized to three groups. Each group had participants who received saline infusions mixed with 0 (a normal saline infusion), 0.2, and 0.5 mg/kg of ketamine. Participants were followed up for 2 weeks. Anxious depression was defined as major depressive disorder with a total score of 7 or more on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale Anxiety-Somatization factor. Generalized estimating equation models were used to investigate the effects of treatment (ketamine vs placebo) and depression type (ANX-TRD vs NANX-TRD) in the reduction of depressive symptoms during the follow-up period. RESULTS: Patients with ANX-TRD were less likely to respond to a single low-dose ketamine infusion than those with NANX-TRD. Among patients with NANX-TRD, low-dose ketamine infusion was significantly superior to placebo for reducing depressive symptoms. However, among patients with ANX-TRD, ketamine was not superior to placebo; nonetheless, approximately 30% of the patients responded to ketamine infusion compared to 13% who responded to the placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose ketamine infusion was effective for Taiwanese patients with NANX-TRD but not so effective for those with ANX-TRD. A higher level of anxiety severity accompanying depression was related to greater depression severity. This may confound and reduce the antidepressant effect of ketamine infusion.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0060594575479626656, 0.9887921214103699, 0.013301546685397625, 0.004796917084604502]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
2033,"Ketamine monotherapy versus adjunctive ketamine in adults with treatment-resistant depression: Results from the Canadian Rapid Treatment Centre of Excellence.^\nA proportion of individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) do not receive adequate therapeutic benefit from conventional monoaminergic antidepressant drugs, leading to treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Ketamine has been shown to provide rapid and significant efficacy in treating patients with TRD. The majority of published studies have investigated the adjunctive efficacy of ketamine with one or more monoaminergic antidepressants. There remains a clinical need to ascertain the relative effectiveness of ketamine monotherapy versus adjunctive ketamine treatment in adults with TRD. In this retrospective study, we investigate multidimensional, self-reported outcomes (i.e., antidepressant, anti-suicidality, antianxiety, and anti-functional impairment) of 220 patients to compare monotherapy (n = 39) and adjunctive (n = 181) ketamine treatment for TRD at a community-based clinic. Both groups had clinically and statistically significant antidepressant effects (p < 0.05). Individuals receiving ketamine monotherapy exhibited a significantly greater reduction on the suicidal ideation (SI) item of the Quick Inventory for Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report 16-Item (QIDS-SR(16)) than the adjunctive group, with a small effect size [F (1, 265) = 4.73; p = 0.03*; partial η(2) = 0.02], and a significantly higher proportion of partial responders at post-infusion 4 (p = 0.034*). No other between-group differences were significant. Limitations include the small sample, single-centred, open-label, non-randomized, uncontrolled, retrospective nature of this study and indication bias. Our real-world evidence suggests that ketamine may be effective as monotherapy or adjunct to monoamine-based treatments. A priority research and clinical vista is to identify subsets of individuals with TRD who are most likely to have a desired therapeutic outcome with monotherapy versus adjunctive ketamine treatment.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.005377205088734627, 0.9867458939552307, 0.013118610717356205, 0.0055969590321183205]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

LSD is well-known to induce perceptual alterations, but unknown is whether LSD alters emotional processing in ways that can support psychotherapy. We investigated the acute effects of LSD on emotional processing using the Face Emotion Recognition Task (FERT) and Multifaceted Empathy Test (MET). The effects of LSD on social behavior were tested using the Social Value Orientation (SVO) test. Two similar placebo-controlled, double-blind, random-order, crossover studies were conducted using 100 μg LSD in 24 subjects and 200 μg LSD in 16 subjects. All of the subjects were healthy and mostly hallucinogen-naive 25- to 65-year-old volunteers (20 men, 20 women). LSD produced feelings of happiness, trust, closeness to others, enhanced explicit and implicit emotional empathy on the MET, and impaired the recognition of sad and fearful faces on the FERT. LSD enhanced the participants' desire to be with other people and increased their prosocial behavior on the SVO test. These effects of LSD on emotion processing and sociality may be useful for LSD-assisted psychotherapy.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.005555878859013319, 0.9873393774032593, 0.019028957933187485, 0.004407233092933893]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
2227,"Acute neuropsychological effects of MDMA and ethanol (co-)administration in healthy volunteers.^\nRATIONALE: In Western societies, a considerable percentage of young people expose themselves to 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ""ecstasy""). Commonly, ecstasy is used in combination with other substances, in particular alcohol (ethanol). MDMA induces both arousing as well as hallucinogenic effects, whereas ethanol is a general central nervous system depressant. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study is to assess the acute effects of single and co-administration of MDMA and ethanol on executive, memory, psychomotor, visuomotor, visuospatial and attention function, as well as on subjective experience. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a four-way, double-blind, randomised, crossover, placebo-controlled study in 16 healthy volunteers (nine male, seven female) between the ages of 18-29. MDMA was given orally (100 mg) and blood alcohol concentration was maintained at 0.6 per thousand by an ethanol infusion regime. RESULTS: Co-administration of MDMA and ethanol was well tolerated and did not show greater impairment of performance compared to the single-drug conditions. Impaired memory function was consistently observed after all drug conditions, whereas impairment of psychomotor function and attention was less consistent across drug conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Co-administration of MDMA and ethanol did not exacerbate the effects of either drug alone. Although the impairment of performance by all drug conditions was relatively moderate, all induced significant impairment of cognitive function.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.009133043698966503, 0.9883089065551758, 0.012517990544438362, 0.005365962162613869]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

METHOD: We administered a self-report questionnaire to 210 respondents. For various licit and illicit substances, participants reported their age of first use, number of lifetime uses, and usage in the previous 30 days. RESULTS: We found a significant rank order for the sequence of first use: 1) alcohol, 2) nicotine, 3) cannabis, 4) LSD, 5) psilocybin, 6) amphetamine, 7) cocaine, 8) MDMA, 9) gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), 10) ephedrine, 11) ketamine. Alcohol and cannabis were the most commonly used substances, both in cumulative number of lifetime uses and in usage in the preceding 30 days. MDMA and amphetamine were also notable as the next 2 most popular drugs for use in the preceding 30 days and in terms of those who had tried the drugs at least once. We identified a progressive rank order of experimentation, with early alcohol or cannabis use (or both) associated with the early use of all other drugs tried by more than 25% of the sample. We found MDMA and amphetamine use to be prevalent, as was general experimentation with all drugs studied, other than heroin.

4356,"MDMA: a social drug in a social context.^\nRATIONALE: The drug ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""ecstasy,"" ""molly"") is thought to produce prosocial effects and enhance social interaction. However, in most laboratory studies to date, the participants have been tested under nonsocial conditions, which may not simulate the effects the drug produces in more naturalistic social settings. METHODS: Healthy experienced MDMA users participated in three laboratory sessions in which they received MDMA (0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg or placebo, double blind). They were randomly assigned to one of three social conditions, in which they were tested alone (solitary (SOL); N = 10), in the presence of a research assistant (research assistant present (RAP); N = 11) or in the presence of another participant who also received the drug (other participant present (OPP); N = 11). RESULTS: As expected, MDMA increased heart rate and blood pressure and produced positive subjective effects in all the three groups. It also increased ratings of attractiveness of another person and increased social interaction in RAP and OPP. The social context affected certain responses to the drug. The effects of MDMA were greater in the OPP condition, compared to the SOL or RAP conditions, on measures of ""feel drug,"" ""dizzy,"" and on cardiovascular. But responses to the drug on other measures, including social behavior, did not differ across the conditions. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide some support for the idea that drugs produce greater effects when they are used in the presence of other drug users. However, the influence of the social context was modest, and it remains to be determined whether other variables related to social context would substantially alter the effects of MDMA or other drugs.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.005127918440848589, 0.9854891896247864, 0.015480861999094486, 0.004893059376627207]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
4420,"The Safety, Clinical, and Neurophysiological Effects of Intranasal Ketamine in Patients Who Do Not Respond to Electroconvulsive Therapy: Protocol for a Pilot, Open-Label Clinical Trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder is among the most disabling illnesses worldwide, with a lifetime prevalence of 16.2%. Research suggests that 20% to 40% of patients with depression do not respond to pharmacotherapy, developing treatment-resistant depression. Electroconvulsive therapy is the gold standard for treating individuals with treatment-resistant depression, with remission rates of approximately 75% to 90%. However, 10% to 25% of patients do not respond to electroconvulsive therapy, and many are unable to tolerate it due to the side effects. Both groups are considered to be patients who do not respond to electroconvulsive therapy, because both groups continue to exhibit symptoms of severe depression, have a limited number of treatment options available, and are in need of rapid treatment. Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, has been shown to exert rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression when administered in subanesthetic doses through 40-minute intravenous infusions. Recently, a ketamine compound, esketamine (Spravato), that is administered through the intranasal route received regulatory approval by the US Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada to treat depression. However, esketamine is challenging to access due to high costs and limited availability. Racemic ketamine (rketamine) is cheap and easy to access; however, the effects in patients who have not responded to electroconvulsive therapy have yet to be understood or tested. This study will use transcranial magnetic stimulation to study mechanisms of human brain cortical physiology at the systemic level to identify neurobiomarkers of response. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this open-label pilot clinical trial is to test the feasibility and safety of intranasal ketamine in patients who have not responded to electroconvulsive therapy. The primary outcome is to determine the feasibility of a larger randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of intranasal ketamine for patients who have not responded to electroconvulsive therapy for clinical indicators in unipolar depression. The secondary outcome is to determine the preliminary effects of an intervention on clinical outcomes, such as depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and quality of living. The third outcome is to explore neurophysiological changes as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation electromyography and electroencephalography to measure changes in cortical excitability as potential predictors of clinical response. METHODS: A sterile solution of racemic ketamine hydrochloride will be administered twice per week for 4 weeks (8 sessions) intranasally to patients with treatment-resistant depression who did not respond to or could not tolerate an acute course of electroconvulsive therapy. We will recruit 25 adults (24-65 years old) over the course of 2 years from an academic psychiatric hospital in Toronto, Canada. RESULTS: This study has received ethics approval, and funding has been secured. The study is currently active. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to test repeated doses of intranasal rketamine in patients who have not responded to electroconvulsive therapy for depression. Results from this study will (1) inform the development of a larger adequately powered randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of intranasal ketamine for depression and (2) determine potential neurophysiological markers of clinical response.

4428,"Cognitive performance after repeated administration of the NMDA positive allosteric modulator SAGE-718 in healthy volunteers.^\nBackground: NMDA receptor hypoactivity has been linked to a range of clinical phenomena, including cognitive dysfunction and alterations in social behavior. Potential treatments for conditions characterized by NMDA hypofunction may involve enhancement of NMDA receptor‐related neurotransmission. In a recent suite of target‐engagement studies, SAGE‐718, an investigational positive allosteric modulator of the NMDA receptor, demonstrated effects on electrophysiological and functional imaging biomarkers in healthy volunteers after a low dose ketamine challenge. These findings are consistent with CNS penetrance and functional engagement of the NMDA receptor. Here, the effects of 10‐day repeated exposure of SAGE‐718 on a core cognitive battery were investigated in healthy volunteers. Methods: Forty subjects were randomized (1:1) to either multiple oral doses of SAGE‐718 (n = 19) plus ketamine or placebo (n = 21) plus ketamine, which was delivered in a double‐blinded manner [SAGE‐718: n = 19, mean (SD) age 42.7 (12.00) years, 15.8% female; Placebo: n = 21, mean (SD) age 42.6 (11.56) years, 15.4% female]. SAGE‐718 oral solution or matching placebo solution was administered as a 1.0‐mg dose in a fasted condition once daily (between 7 and 10 AM) over the course of 10 days. Blood samples were taken and processed for pharmacokinetic analysis of concentrations of SAGE‐718. Plasma samples were used to calculate Cmax as well as other PK parameters. Computerized testing was used to measure performance on key cognitive domains, including attention, working memory, processing speed, executive function, and motor reaction time. Assessments included computerized versions of the International Shopping List Test (verbal learning), International Shopping List Test‐Delayed Recall (memory), Groton Maze Learning Test (executive function), Social Emotional Cognition Test (emotional cognition), Detection Test (psychomotor function), Identification Test (attention), One Back Test (working memory), Two Back Test (higher‐order working memory), Stop Signal Reaction Test (inhibition), and the Continuous Paired Associate Learning Test (paired associated learning). A mixed‐effect regression model analysis (MMRM) was applied, with change from baseline in each cognitive test score as the response variable, and treatment, visit, and visit‐by‐treatment interaction as fixed effects, baseline as a covariate, and measurements within the same subject as repeated measure. Unstructured covariance structure was applied for the repeated measure. Safety was assessed by adverse event reporting, standard clinical assessments, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, the Clinician Administered Dissociate State Scale, the Observers Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale, and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Results: As compared to placebo, statistically significant improvements were observed in the Two‐Back Test at days 2, 4 and 8 of testing (p < 0.05). Compared to placebo, statistically significant improvement was observed on the Groton Maze Test at day 6 of testing (p < 0.05). A dose‐response relationship was observed for the Two‐Back Test, with Cmax positively correlated with an increase in change from baseline performance on the Two‐Back Test (p = 0.02). A similar trend was observed for the Groton Maze Test (Cmax vs change from baseline, p = 0.06). SAGE‐718 was generally well tolerated with no serious adverse events or deaths observed in the trial subjects. The most frequent treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported after SAGE‐718 administration were mild and numerically similar to those seen with placebo (TEAE: SAGE‐718, n = 6 (31.6%); placebo, n = 7 (33.3%)). No TEAEs resulted in discontinuation or dose reduction of SAGE‐718. No significant changes in clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, or ECGS were observed. Conclusions: Healthy volunteers dosed with SAGE‐718 exhibited greater improvement on tests of higher‐order working memory (Two‐Back Test) and complex problem solving (Groton Maze Test), which at times reached the threshold for statistical significance as compared to subjects receiving placebo. SAGE‐718 was generally well tolerated by the trial subjects over 10 days of exposure. Improvements in executive performance, as reflected by significant improvements on the Two‐Back and Groton Maze Tests, suggest that further investigation of SAGE‐718 is warranted for the treatment of conditions characterized by states of relative NMDA hypofunction, particularly those manifesting with executive deficits.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.005993749480694532, 0.9882652759552002, 0.015616473741829395, 0.004301733803004026]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
4633,"Creative processes under the influence of a low dose of LSD: a placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in healthy volunteers.^\nBackground: Previously scientific studies have shown the potential of psychedelics in full hallucinogenic doses to change creativity, with enhancing effects on divergent thinking specifically while under the influence of the substance. This effect might be beneficial in a therapeutic context, in patients suffering from rigid thinking patterns, like depression. Anecdotal evidence has suggested that psychedelics in small, sub‐hallucinogenic doses (microdosing) might improve creativity, and some users selfmedicate with it to find relief for their depressive symptoms. While scientific research with small doses of psychedelics is scarce, we aimed to quantify the cognitive effects of single small LSD doses on creative processes in healthy volunteers in a dosefinding study. Methods: The study was conducted according to a doubleblind, randomized, placebo‐controlled, within‐subject design with four oral LSD doses (0, 5, 10, and 20 μg, LSD base) given on four separate test days, with minimally five days of washout in between. LSD was formulated as a solution of 25 μg LSD base in 1mL ethanol (96%) which resulted in 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 mL LSD, for 5, 10, and 20 μg LSD. Doses were administered sublingually with a 1 mL syringe. To mask the treatment condition, ethanol was added so that all syringes contained the same volume. Placebo was 1 mL ethanol only (96%). Participants were 24 healthy males (N = 12) and females (N = 12) aged 22.75 on average (SD = 2.97). All consumed alcohol and had experience with other recreational drugs. Task‐based creativity was assessed three hours post‐treatment with the Alternate Uses Task (AUT) and five hours post‐treatment with the Story Writing task. In the latter participants were asked to write a (non)‐fictive story around two given words. To assess the level of divergent thinking or creativity of the story, two independent raters assigned a creativity score between zero to five to the stories and their scores were averaged to a final creativity score. The AUT is a measure of divergent thinking. Responses are scored afterward by two independent raters. Dependent outcome variables are Fluency, Originality, the ratio of Fluency and Originality, Flexibility, and Elaboration. Parallel versions of tasks were used on separate test days. In addition, the participant selfrated how creative s/he felt on a visual analogue scale (VAS). This was done eleven times during the test day, and daily, up to four days after treatment administration. Blood samples were taken during the test day to determine LSD concentrations. The study was conducted according to the declaration of Helsinki and its amendments, which is the international convention governing drug studies in human volunteers (World‐Medical‐ Association, 2013). A permit for obtaining, storing, and administering LSD was obtained from the Dutch Drug Enforcement Administration. The study was registered in the Netherlands Trial Register (NTR7102). All data entered SPSS version 24.0, where a General Linear Model Repeated Measures (GLM RM) Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was run on data of the AUT, the Story Writing Task, and the VAS. LSD (four levels) was included as a within‐subject factor; additional within‐subject factors were Time (ten levels) or Day (four levels) for the VASs. In the case of a main LSD or Time effect, Bonferronicorrected pairwise comparisons and contrast analyses for that particular measure were conducted with the placebo or the baseline as a reference category. Partial eta squared (partial η2) is reported to demonstrate the effect magnitude, and it is based on Cohen's f, which defines small, medium, and large as respectively 0.10, 0.25, and 0.50, which corresponds to partial η2 values of 0.01, 0.06, and 0.14. Results: GLM RM ANOVA did not show main effects of LSD on AUT parameters Fluency (F3,69 = 0.65, p = 0.59, partial η2 = 0.03), Elaboration (F3,69 = 0.09, p = 0.99, partial η2 = 0.004), Flexibility (F3,69 = 2.30, p = 0.08, partial η2 = 0.09), Originality (F3,69 = 0.28, p = 0.84, partial η2 = 0.01), and Ra io (F3,66 = 0.17, p = 0.92, partial η2 = 0.01). RM GLM ANOVA revealed no main LSD effect (F3,69 = 1.31, p = 0.28, partial η2 = 0.05) on rater‐scored Creativity which was 2.76 (0.22) on average (SEM) on a scale from zero to five. GLM RM ANOVA did not reveal main effects of LSD (F3,57 = 1.22, p = 0.31, partial η2 = 0.06) or Day (F3,57 = 0.14, p = 0.93, partial η2 = 0.008), or their interaction (F9,171 = 1.03, p = 0.42, partial η2 = 0.05) on the self‐rated levels of Creativity experienced up to four days after treatment administration. At 3 hours post‐administration the AUT was performed the predicted mean (SD) LSD plasma concentrations were 113 (32), 212 (70), and 391 (146) pg/mL after LSD 5, 10, and 20 μg, respectively.

Conclusions: Despite anecdotal reports of positive effects of psychedelic microdoses on creative cognitive processes in users, the present study did not demonstrate LSD effects on task‐based or self‐rated creative thinking. Nonetheless, findings stimulate further research in a placebo‐controlled setting, and eventually in patient populations, to test whether LSD microdoses change potentially creative processes earlier after LSD administration, closer to LSD plasma peak concentrations, or after repeated administrations.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.005282852333039045, 0.9861838221549988, 0.018389765173196793, 0.004239595960825682]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
5071,"Cognitive and subjective acute dose effects of intramuscular ketamine in healthy adults.^\nKetamine is a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist. Given the purported role of the NMDA receptor in long-term potentiation, the primary purpose of the present study was to further understand the dose-related effects of ketamine on memory. The study was also designed to provide information about the relative effects of ketamine on memory versus nonmemory effects and to more fully characterize ketamine's overall pattern and time course of effects. Single intramuscular injections of ketamine (0.2 mg/kg, 0.4 mg/kg) were administered to 18 healthy adult volunteers using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Word lists were used to evaluate episodic memory (free recall, recognition memory, source memory) and metamemory. Working memory, time estimation, psychomotor performance, and subjective effects were assessed repeatedly for 5 hours after drug administration. Ketamine selectively impaired encoding (as measured by free recall) while sparing retrieval, working memory while sparing attention, and digit symbol substitution task speed while sparing accuracy. Ketamine did not significantly impair recognition or source memory, metamemory, or time estimation. There were no hallucinations or increases in mystical experiences with ketamine. Memory measures were less sensitive to ketamine effects than subjective or psychomotor measures. Subjective effects lasted longer than memory and most psychomotor impairments. Ketamine produces selective, transient, dose- and time-related effects. In conjunction with previous studies of drugs with different mechanisms of actions, the observed selectivity of effects enhances the understanding of the pharmacological mechanisms underlying memory, attention, psychomotor performance, and subjective experience.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.006755203474313021, 0.9888806343078613, 0.014518682844936848, 0.005338465794920921]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
5213,"Ketamine for acute suicidality in the emergency department: A systematic review.^\nINTRODUCTION: There are no emergent pharmaceutical interventions for acute suicidal ideation, a common presenting complaint in the ED. Ketamine is a NMDA agonist frequently used by ED physicians for sedation and analgesia. Prior evidence from studies conducted in inpatient psychiatry units suggests that ketamine may have a role in alleviating treatment-resistant depression as well as suicidal ideation. METHODS: PubMed, MEDLINE, and Cochrane reviews were queried for articles related to keywords ketamine, suicidality, suicidal ideation, and emergency department/room. Relevant articles were selected and reviewed by two separate authors. RESULTS: Three relevant, prospective studies were identified with a mean sample size of 25.7. Each was performed using 0.2 mg/kg ketamine for individuals receiving active treatment. Each study reported a decrease in depressive symptoms among those receiving ketamine. One study reported a significant reduction in SI when compared to placebo at 90 min that became non-significant by 230 min. No significant adverse events were reported in any study. CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests that ketamine is a promising, safe potential intervention for acute suicidality in the ED. Convincing evidence for efficacy of ketamine for acute suicidal ideation remains lacking, and this promising potential intervention should be further investigated.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.06372355669736862, 0.0660645142197609, 0.043325819075107574, 0.9616617560386658]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]"
5346,"Real-world experience of esketamine use to manage treatment-resistant depression: A multicentric study on safety and effectiveness (REAL-ESK study).^\nBACKGROUND: Treatment-resistant Depression (TRD) represents a widespread disorder with significant direct and indirect healthcare costs. esketamine, the S-enantiomer of ketamine, has been recently approved for TRD, but real-world studies are needed to prove its efficacy in naturalistic settings. OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the effectiveness and safety of esketamine nasal spray in a clinical sample of patients with TRD from several Italian mental health services. METHODS: REAL-ESK study is an observational, retrospective and multicentric study comprising a total of 116 TRD patients treated with esketamine nasal spray. Anamnestic data and psychometric assessment (MADRS, HAMD-21, HAM-A) were collected from medical records at baseline (T0), one month (T1) and three month (T2) follow-ups. RESULTS: A significant reduction of depressive symptoms was found at T1 and T2 compared to T0. A dramatic increase in clinical response (64.2 %) and remission rates (40.6 %) was detected at T2 compared to T1. No unexpected safety concerns were observed, side effects rates were comparable to those reported in RCTs. No differences in efficacy have been found among patients with and without psychiatric comorbidities. LIMITATIONS: The open design of the study and the absence of a placebo or active comparator group are limitations. The study lacks an inter-rater reliability evaluation of the assessments among the different centres. Side effects evaluation did not involve any specific scale.

5873,"Increased thalamic resting-state connectivity as a core driver of LSD-induced hallucinations.^\nOBJECTIVE: It has been proposed that the thalamocortical system is an important site of action of hallucinogenic drugs and an essential component of the neural correlates of consciousness. Hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD can be used to induce profoundly altered states of consciousness, and it is thus of interest to test the effects of these drugs on this system. METHOD: 100 μg LSD was administrated orally to 20 healthy participants prior to fMRI assessment. Whole brain thalamic functional connectivity was measured using ROI-to-ROI and ROI-to-voxel approaches. Correlation analyses were used to explore relationships between thalamic connectivity to regions involved in auditory and visual hallucinations and subjective ratings on auditory and visual drug effects. RESULTS: LSD caused significant alterations in all dimensions of the 5D-ASC scale and significantly increased thalamic functional connectivity to various cortical regions. Furthermore, LSD-induced functional connectivity measures between the thalamus and the right fusiform gyrus and insula correlated significantly with subjective auditory and visual drug effects. CONCLUSION: Hallucinogenic drug effects might be provoked by facilitations of cortical excitability via thalamocortical interactions. Our findings have implications for the understanding of the mechanism of action of hallucinogenic drugs and provide further insight into the role of the 5-HT(2A) -receptor in altered states of consciousness.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.005293655209243298, 0.9851537942886353, 0.017262447625398636, 0.004729706794023514]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
6158,"Comparative Acute Effects of LSD, Psilocybin and Mescaline.^\nLSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), psilocybin (the active substance in ""magic mushrooms"") and mescaline (the active substance in Peyote and San Pedro cacti) are serotonergic hallucinogens widely used for recreational and/or ethnomedical purposes. LSD, psilocybin and mescaline are thought to induce prototypical psychedelic effects primarily via stimulation of the 5‐HT2A receptor. However, there are differences in their molecular structures (LSD: ergoline, psilocybin: tryptamine; mescaline: phenethylamine)and receptor activation profiles which may induce different subjective effects. To date, there are no modern studies comparing these three substances directly within the same clinical study and research subjects using validated psychometric tools. Therefore, the LPM‐Study compares the acute effects of LSD, psilocybin, mescaline and placebo in a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, 4‐period cross‐over design with four treatment conditions: 1) 100 μg LSD, 2) 20 mg psilocybin, 3) 300 mg mescaline, and 4) placebo. The main objective of this study is to determine whether LSD, psilocybin and mescaline produce qualitatively similar subjective alterations of mind and associated brain activity patterns despite their unique receptor activation profiles. The study investigates psychological (psychometry), physiological and neuronal (magnetic resonance imaging) variables. The LPM‐Study provides insight into the acute effects profiles of three serotonergic hallucinogens.

6247,"The Effect of LSD on Neural Synchrony, Prosocial Behavior, and Relationship Quality.^\nEvidence is growing that psychedelic substances such as psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and ayahuasca could be a potential alternative treatment option for common and difficult to treat psychiatric conditions. One proposed mechanism that psychedelics target, which is a hallmark of seemingly all psychiatric disorders, are deficits in social cognitive abilities. However, the neural underpinnings of psychedelic induced alterations in prosocial behavior are currently unknown. The investigators hypothesize psychedelics increase such prosocial behaviors by increasing neural synchrony, which is the coupling of brain‐to‐brain activity across two or more people; it has been found to underlie social connection and various forms of shared prosocial behavior. The current project will primarily assess whether LSD enhances neural synchrony between romantic partners. Second, the investigators will assess whether LSD enhances prosocial behavior between members of a dyad, thus replicating previous studies which assessed prosocial behavior within one individual at a time. The investigators will also assess the relationship between neural synchrony and outcome variables of the prosocial behaviour tasks. Lastly, it will be assessed whether LSD‐induced changes in neural synchrony and/or prosocial behaviour affect persisting relationship quality. Oxytocin and cytokine concentrations, will also be quantified to investigate whether there is a relationship between these factors and changes in prosocial behaviour. The study design will be conducted according to a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, 2‐way crossover design. Healthy participants (N=60) who are in a relationship (N=30 couples) will receive placebo and an oral dose of 50 µg of LSD. Between each condition, there will be a minimum of 14 days washout.

7113,"Pediatric premedication: a double-blind randomized trial of dexmedetomidine or ketamine alone versus a combination of dexmedetomidine and ketamine.^\nBACKGROUND: Preoperative anxiety is common in pediatric patients. When dexmedetomidine is used alone for sedation as premedication, children tend to awaken when separated from their parents, and body movements occur during invasive procedures. We tested the hypothesis that the combination of dexmedetomidine and ketamine may be a useful premedication to alleviate preoperative anxiety and improve cooperation during intravenous cannulation in pediatric patients, while producing minimal adverse events. METHODS: A total of 135 children, aged 2-5 years and American Society of Anesthesiologists status I-II, scheduled for eye surgery were randomly allocated to receive intranasal dexmedetomidine 2.5 μg/kg (group D), oral ketamine 3 mg/kg and intranasal dexmedetomidine 2 μg/kg (group DK), or oral ketamine 6 mg/kg (group K) 30 min before surgery. Sedation state was evaluated every 10 min after premedication and emotional state was assessed during separation from their parents and peripheral intravenous cannulation. Adverse events were recorded for 24 h postoperatively. The primary endpoint was the rate of successful intravenous cannulation. RESULTS: The rate of successful venous cannulation was 47% with dexmedetomidine alone, 68% with ketamine alone, and 80% with combined premedication (P = 0.006). The rate of satisfactory separation from parents was not different among groups. The incidence of adverse events was higher in group K compared with the other two groups (postoperative vomiting, P = 0.0041; respiratory-related complications during the perioperative period, P = 0.0032; and postoperative psychological/psychiatric adverse events, P = 0.0152). CONCLUSION: The combination of intranasal dexmedetomidine 2 μg/kg and oral ketamine 3 mg/kg produces satisfactory separation from parents and more successful venous cannulation, allowing children to smoothly accept induction of general anesthesia.

7258,"Case report: Maintaining altered states of consciousness over repeated ketamine infusions may be key to facilitate long-lasting antidepressant effects: some initial lessons from a personalized-dosing single-case study.^\nBackgroundThe interest in psychoactive agents for treating mental disorders has gathered a growing body of scientific interest. However, research on the relationship between altered states of consciousness (ASCs) and ketamine's antidepressant properties is still limited. Likewise, approaches to sustain early treatment success for the long-term are needed. Taking both aspects into account, the question arises whether the persistence of recurrent ASCs during the subsequent infusion sessions is crucial for the preservation of antidepressant effects during prolonged continued ketamine therapy.AimIn this case study we explored whether recurrent ASC experiences across a large number of infusions are associated with improved antidepressant effects in a single case study.MethodsA 62-year-old patient with treatment-resistant depression, who has been suffering from depressive episodes for over 20 years, was observed for 12 consecutive infusions across 16 weeks. ASCs during ketamine sessions were measured with the 5D-ASC, and pre/post-infusion depression scores with the BDI-II questionnaire. To emphasize psychoactive experiences a personalized antidepressant dose regimen was used.ResultsWe found a strong correlation between the experienced ASCs during ketamine infusions and the antidepressant effect: the stronger the ASCs overall, the stronger the resulting antidepressant effect. This correlation was consistently observed throughout the infusion series, independent of the number of ketamine sessions completed before. However, despite a personalized dose regimen, neither peri-infusion ASCs nor antidepressant effects could be established on a regular basis, leading overall to no improvement in treatment outcome.ConclusionMaintaining psychoactive effects over repeated ketamine infusions may be key to facilitate long-lasting antidepressant effects. However, for some depressed individuals maintenance of antidepressant effects and/or peri-infusion ASCs might not be achieved, even when personalized dosing is used.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.006633381824940443, 0.9885109663009644, 0.015074646100401878, 0.005458057392388582]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
7455,"The effects of psilocybin and MDMA on between-network resting state functional connectivity in healthy volunteers.^\nPerturbing a system and observing the consequences is a classic scientific strategy for understanding a phenomenon. Psychedelic drugs perturb consciousness in a marked and novel way and thus are powerful tools for studying its mechanisms. In the present analysis, we measured changes in resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) between a standard template of different independent components analysis (ICA)-derived resting state networks (RSNs) under the influence of two different psychoactive drugs, the stimulant/psychedelic hybrid, MDMA, and the classic psychedelic, psilocybin. Both were given in placebo-controlled designs and produced marked subjective effects, although reports of more profound changes in consciousness were given after psilocybin. Between-network RSFC was generally increased under psilocybin, implying that networks become less differentiated from each other in the psychedelic state. Decreased RSFC between visual and sensorimotor RSNs was also observed. MDMA had a notably less marked effect on between-network RSFC, implying that the extensive changes observed under psilocybin may be exclusive to classic psychedelic drugs and related to their especially profound effects on consciousness. The novel analytical approach applied here may be applied to other altered states of consciousness to improve our characterization of different conscious states and ultimately advance our understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying them.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.004904483910650015, 0.9759707450866699, 0.022903164848685265, 0.005581359378993511]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]"

8100,"Characterization and prediction of acute and sustained response to psychedelic psilocybin in a mindfulness group retreat.^\nMeditation and psychedelics have played key roles in humankind's search for self-transcendence and personal change. However, neither their possible synergistic effects, nor related state and trait predictors have been experimentally studied. To elucidate these issues, we administered double-blind the model psychedelic drug psilocybin (315 μg/kg PO) or placebo to meditators (n = 39) during a 5-day mindfulness group retreat. Psilocybin increased meditation depth and incidence of positively experienced self-dissolution along the perception-hallucination continuum, without concomitant anxiety. Openness, optimism, and emotional reappraisal were predictors of the acute response. Compared with placebo, psilocybin enhanced post-intervention mindfulness and produced larger positive changes in psychosocial functioning at a 4-month follow-up, which were corroborated by external ratings, and associated with magnitude of acute self-dissolution experience. Meditation seems to enhance psilocybin's positive effects while counteracting possible dysphoric responses. These findings highlight the interactions between non-pharmacological and pharmacological factors, and the role of emotion/attention regulation in shaping the experiential quality of psychedelic states, as well as the experience of selflessness as a modulator of behavior and attitudes.

However, this drug also has transient cardiovascular stimulatory effects, and there are limited data about potential predictors of these cardiovascular effects. METHODS: A total of 135 patients with unipolar and bipolar depression received a total of 741 ketamine infusions (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min). Blood pressure and pulse were monitored every 10 min during the infusions and 30 min after the infusions. Depressive, psychotomimetic and dissociative symptom severity was assessed at baseline and 4 hours after each infusion. RESULTS: The maximum blood pressure and pulse values were observed at 30-40 min during infusions. The largest mean systolic/diastolic blood pressure increases were 7.4/6.0 mmHg, and the largest mean pulse increase was 1.9 beats per min. No significant change in blood pressure and pulse was found in the second to sixth infusions compared with the first infusion. Patients who were older (age⩾50 years), hypertensive and receiving infusions while exhibiting dissociative symptoms showed greater maximal changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure than patients who were younger (age<50 years), normotensive and without dissociative symptoms (all p < 0.05). Hypertensive patients had less elevation of pulse than normotensive patients (p < 0.05).

In animal studies, repeated exposure to MDMA has been associated with dendritic but also axonal degeneration in the brain. However, translation of the axonal findings, specifically, to humans has been repeatedly questioned and the few existing studies investigating white matter alterations in human chronic MDMA users have yielded conflicting findings. In this study, we combined whole-brain diffusion tensor imaging and neurofilament light chain (NfL) analysis in blood to reveal potential MDMA-induced axonal neuropathology. To this end, we assessed 39 chronic MDMA users and 39 matched MDMA-naïve healthy controls. MDMA users showed increased fractional anisotropy in several white matter tracts, most prominently in the corpus callosum as well as corticospinal tracts, with these findings partly related to MDMA use intensity. However, the NfL levels of MDMA users were not significantly different from those of controls. We conclude that MDMA use is not associated with significant white matter lesions due to the absence of reduced fractional anisotropy and increased NfL levels commonly observed in conditions associated with white matter lesions, including stimulant and ketamine use disorders. Hence, the MDMA-induced axonal degradation demonstrated in animal models was not observed in this human study of chronic MDMA users.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.004758263006806374, 0.9778257608413696, 0.022594476118683815, 0.005461324937641621]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

Little is known about KOR agonist effects in humans and about users of SD. OBJECTIVES: To characterize the reasons, methods, and reported consequences of SD use. METHODS: Individuals reading SD-related pages of a drug-information website were invited to anonymously complete an online questionnaire if they had used SD. RESULTS: Participants (N=500) were 92.6% male and 23.4 ± 8.7 (mean ± s.d.) years old. They had used a median of six times (range 1-250). 80.6% probably or definitely would use SD again. Most participants (92.6%) typically smoked or vaporized SD product. When smoked, the drug's main effects were estimated to last 14.1 ± 12.8 (range 0.5-120) minutes. When asked to compare SD effects to other methods of altering consciousness, the most common answer was that SD was unique (38.4%). 25.8% reported persisting (≥ 24 h) positive effects (often described as increased sense of well-being) on at least one occasion. 4.4% reported persisting negative effects (most often anxiety). CONCLUSIONS: SD is typically smoked, acute effects are brief, and persistent adverse effects are uncommon. In addition to acute hallucinogenic effects, SD may produce subacute increases in subjective well-being. Such a subacute effect would be unusual for a drug that is used non-medically, as withdrawal from other drugs typically either does not affect mood or causes dysphoria.

Oral fluid is an important alternative matrix for drug testing, but little is known about MDMA detection windows in oral fluid. AIMS: The aim was to characterize MDMA and metabolite disposition in expectorated oral fluid after controlled MDMA administration. METHODS: Placebo, low (1.0 mg/kg), and high (1.6 mg/kg) oral MDMA doses were given double-blind in random order in separate sessions to 29 healthy adults with histories of MDMA use. One thousand two hundred eighty-six expectorated oral fluid specimens collected up to 7 days after dosing were analyzed for MDMA, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine (HMMA), and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine (HMA) by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The limits of quantification were 5 ng/mL for MDMA and MDA and 10 ng/mL for HMA and HMMA. RESULTS: MDMA was the primary analyte detected, with concentrations up to 12,000 ng/mL in 872 specimens (67.8%). MDA was quantified in 656 specimens (51.0%) at concentrations <403 ng/mL and was never present without concurrent MDMA. HMA and HMMA were not detected. Of the specimens, 59.8%, 58.6%, and 54.9% were found to be MDMA positive at the Talloires (20 ng/mL), Driving under the Influence of Drugs, Alcohol, and Medicines (25 ng/mL) and proposed US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (50 ng/mL) confirmation cutoffs, respectively. MDMA was first observed in oral fluid 0.25-1.25 hours after dosing; MDA was initially detected at 0.5-1.75 hours. In general, the windows of detection for MDMA and MDA were 47 and 29 hours, respectively, although a few specimens were positive up to 71 and 47 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Oral fluid monitoring efficiently detects single, recreational 70-150 mg of MDMA use for 1-2 days.

640,"Validation of the revised Mystical Experience Questionnaire in experimental sessions with psilocybin.^\nThe 30-item revised Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ30) was previously developed within an online survey of mystical-type experiences occasioned by psilocybin-containing mushrooms. The rated experiences occurred on average eight years before completion of the questionnaire. The current paper validates the MEQ30 using data from experimental studies with controlled doses of psilocybin. Data were pooled and analyzed from five laboratory experiments in which participants (n=184) received a moderate to high oral dose of psilocybin (at least 20 mg/70 kg). Results of confirmatory factor analysis demonstrate the reliability and internal validity of the MEQ30. Structural equation models demonstrate the external and convergent validity of the MEQ30 by showing that latent variable scores on the MEQ30 positively predict persisting change in attitudes, behavior, and well-being attributed to experiences with psilocybin while controlling for the contribution of the participant-rated intensity of drug effects. These findings support the use of the MEQ30 as an efficient measure of individual mystical experiences. A method to score a ""complete mystical experience"" that was used in previous versions of the mystical experience questionnaire is validated in the MEQ30, and a stand-alone version of the MEQ30 is provided for use in future research.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.006071027368307114, 0.9856435060501099, 0.016278095543384552, 0.005540779326111078]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
717,"Effects of MDMA on sociability and neural response to social threat and social reward.^\nRATIONALE: +/-3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""ecstasy"") reportedly produces unique subjective effects, including increased sociability, feelings of closeness with others, and reduced interpersonal defensiveness. Despite their apparent importance in recreational and potential psychotherapeutic use of MDMA, the defining characteristics and neurobiological mechanisms of these interpersonal effects are poorly understood. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated acute effects of MDMA on self-reported sociability and neuronal activation in response to socially threatening (angry and fearful faces) and socially rewarding (happy faces) stimuli. Assessment of social threat response focused on amygdala activation, whereas assessment of social reward focused on ventral striatum activation. Healthy volunteers (N = 9) reporting past ecstasy use completed three experimental sessions, receiving MDMA (0.75 and 1.5 mg/kg) and placebo (PBO) under double-blind conditions. During peak drug effects, participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while viewing standardized images depicting emotional facial expressions including angry, fearful, happy, and neutral expressions. They also completed standardized self-report measures of sociability. RESULTS: MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) increased self-reported sociability compared to MDMA (0.75 mg/kg) and PBO. MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) attenuated left amygdala response to angry facial expressions compared to PBO, but MDMA did not affect amygdala reactivity to fearful expressions. MDMA (0.75 mg/kg) enhanced ventral striatum response to happy expressions relative to PBO. CONCLUSIONS: These data present the first evidence that MDMA may increase sociability in humans both by diminishing responses to threatening stimuli and enhancing responses to rewarding social signals.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.006181848235428333, 0.9886335134506226, 0.016147729009389877, 0.004334760829806328]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1054,"Prospective associations between meth/amphetamine (speed) and MDMA (ecstasy) use and depressive symptoms in secondary school students.^\nBACKGROUND: Research has raised significant concern regarding the affective consequences of synthetic drug use. However, little evidence from well-controlled longitudinal studies exists on these consequences. The aim of this study was to determine whether use of meth/amphetamine (speed) and ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) is independently predictive of subsequent depressive symptoms in adolescents. METHODS: A sample of 3880 adolescents from secondary schools in disadvantaged areas of Quebec, Canada, were followed over time (2003-2008). Logistic regression was used to test the association between meth/amphetamine and MDMA use in grade 10 (ages 15-16 years) and elevated depressive symptoms on an abridged Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale in grade 11, controlling for pre-existing individual and contextual characteristics. RESULTS: After adjustment, both MDMA use (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.6) and meth/amphetamine use (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.3) in grade 10 significantly increased the odds of elevated depressive symptoms in grade 11. These relationships did not vary by gender or pre-existing depressive symptoms. Increased risk was particularly observed in concurrent usage (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.9). CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent use of meth/amphetamine and MDMA (particularly concurrent use) is independently associated with subsequent depressive symptoms. Further enquiry must determine whether these associations reflect drug-induced neurotoxicity and whether adolescence is a period of increased vulnerability to the hazards of synthetic drug exposure.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.947035551071167, 0.3268889784812927, 0.07064808160066605, 0.05656609684228897]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1109,"A voxel-based PET investigation of the long-term effects of ""ecstasy"" consumption on brain serotonin transporters.^\nObjective: Recent functional imaging studies have reported evidence of alterations in the serotonergic system induced by 3,4- methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), or ""Ecstasy."" However, these studies have often been limited by small sample size, lack of tracer selectivity, unreliable assessment of MDMA doses, insufficiently matched comparison groups, or region-of-interest analysis. Method: Positron emission tomography (PET) using the specific serotonin transporter ligand [ 11C](+)McN5652 was performed in 117 subjects: 30 current MDMA users, 29 former MDMA users, 29 drug-naive comparison subjects, and 29 users of drugs other than MDMA (polydrug comparison subjects). Self-assessment of drug history was checked by analyzing hair samples. Local serotonin transporter availability was computed by a regularized reference tissue approach. Voxel-based comparison of serotonin transporter availability was performed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM 99). Results: Serotonin transporter availability in current MDMA users was significantly reduced in the mesencephalon, thalamus, left caudate, hippocampus, occipital cortex, temporal lobes, and posterior cingulate gyrus compared with all other groups. Reduction was more pronounced in female than in male subjects. There was no significant difference of serotonin transporter availability among former MDMA users and the drug-naive and polydrug comparison subjects. A negative correlation between serotonin transporter availability and mean MDMA dose was found in occipital visual areas and in the left precentral sulcus of current MDMA users. In addition, there was a significant positive correlation between the serotonin transporter availability and the MDMA abstention period in brainstem and in the basal forebrain in all MDMA users. Conclusions: These findings support the hypothesis of MDMA-induced protracted alterations of the serotonergic system and indicate that the reduced availability of serotonin transporter, as measured by PET, might be reversible. Women appear to be more susceptible than men to MDMA-induced alterations of the serotonergic system.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.005105029791593552, 0.9852322340011597, 0.015932438895106316, 0.005025404039770365]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1148,"Impulsivity, risk taking and recreational 'ecstasy' (MDMA) use.^\nThe present study investigated characteristics of recreational drug users, especially 'ecstasy' (MDMA) users, in 254 undergraduates. All participants completed a drug history questionnaire (DHQ), the impulsiveness venturesomeness and empathy questionnaire, a novel risk-taking task (Bets16), and 59 also completed the tri-dimensional personality questionnaire (TPQ). DHQ responses allocated participants to five groups: non-drug controls, cannabis users, polydrug (no ecstasy) users, low (<20 occasions) ecstasy users and high (>20 occasions) ecstasy users. Eighteen percent of the sample had used ecstasy and of the ecstasy users, only one had not used other substances. A larger proportion of high ecstasy users had also used amphetamines, cocaine and LSD in comparison to the low ecstasy and non-ecstasy polydrug users. High ecstasy users typically took significantly more ecstasy tablets compared with low ecstasy users. Impulsiveness, venturesomeness and novelty seeking behaviour increased from the non-drug users to high ecstasy users. Ecstasy users (low and high) and polydrug (non-ecstasy) users had higher levels of impulsivity, venturesomeness and novelty seeking behaviour compared with non-drug users. Furthermore, high ecstasy users scored higher on the Bets16 risk-taking measure than non-drug users, cannabis users and low ecstasy users. The findings are discussed in relation to: (i) the possibility that increased impulsivity pre-dated drug use; and (ii) the possible link between impulsivity and the putative serotonergic neurotoxicity of ecstasy.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0075337523594498634, 0.9862317442893982, 0.017027702182531357, 0.00437058275565505]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1418,"Acute effects of intravenous sub-anesthetic doses of ketamine and intranasal inhaled esketamine on suicidal ideation: A systematic review and meta-analysis.^\nPurpose: Suicide is a major public health concern with currently no validated and efficacious treatments approved. Preliminary evidence suggests that intravenous ketamine has rapid and sustained antidepressant effects, making it a candidate with therapeutic potential for depressed patients at risk for suicide. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of ketamine and esketamine in reducing suicidal ideation (SI), as well as their respective onset and duration of action. Data Sources: We searched PubMed, Embase, Ovid, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases for studies published from inception to September 29, 2022. Study Eligibility Criteria: We conducted a systematic review of all parallel randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the effect and duration of ketamine or esketamine on SI. Our primary outcome measure was the Suicide Scale score, which was measured using the Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI), Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), or Modified Scale for Suicidal Ideation (MSSI). To obtain effect sizes (Cohen’s d), we calculated the difference in Suicide Scale scores before and after administration in each group. Results: Our study showed that intravenous sub-anesthetic doses of ketamine and intranasal inhaled esketamine had a significant anti-SI effect. Specifically, ketamine produced a large degree of anti-SI effect within the 4–6 hours (Cohen’s d = 1.16, 95% CI: 0.50, 1.81) and a medium-large degree in the 24 hours (Cohen’s d = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.48, 1.41). Esketamine, on the other hand, produced a small-medium degree of anti-SI effect within the 4–6 hours timeframe (Cohen’s d = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.44) and the 24 hours (Cohen’s d = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.17, 0.47). Conclusion: Intravenous sub-anesthetic doses of ketamine and intranasal inhaled esketamine could reduce SI within 4 hours and last for 24 hours.

1455,"Effects of Low-Dose Ketamine on the Antidepressant Efficacy and Suicidal Ideations in Patients Undergoing Electroconvulsive Therapy.^\nOBJECTIVES: It remains controversial whether a subanesthetic dose of ketamine could modulate the antidepressant effect of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in patients with major depressive disorder. We investigated the effect of ketamine on accelerating the antidepressant efficacy of ECT. METHODS: One hundred twenty-seven patients with major depressive disorder were included in this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. The study group received 0.3 mg/kg ketamine, and the control group received an isovolumetric dose of normal saline before undergoing ECT under propofol anesthesia. The main outcome was the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score after each ECT session. Suicidal ideation (SI) was also evaluated using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. The response, remission, and recurrence rates were analyzed using time-to-event analysis. RESULTS: No significant differences were found in the overall response, remission, and relapse rates between the groups (P > 0.05). The median number of ECT sessions for achieving response was 4.0 ± 0.41 in the study group and 7.0 ± 0.79 in the control group (P < 0.05). The median number of ECT sessions for achieving remission in the study and control groups was 8.0 ± 0.29 and 9.0 ± 0.48, respectively (P < 0.05). The median number of ECT sessions for achieving SI reduction in the study and control groups was 3.0 ± 0.75 and 6.0 ± 1.19, respectively (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose ketamine (0.3 mg/kg) could modulate the antidepressant efficacy of ECT via accelerating the onset of its effects and reducing the number of ECT sessions required to obtain response, remission, and SI reduction, without influencing the relapse rates in remitting patients after ECT treatment.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.006802433170378208, 0.9888766407966614, 0.013426081277430058, 0.00518232025206089]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1806,"A Single Ketamine Infusion Combined With Motivational Enhancement Therapy for Alcohol Use Disorder: A Randomized Midazolam-Controlled Pilot Trial.^\nOBJECTIVE: Pharmacotherapy and behavioral treatments for alcohol use disorder are limited in their effectiveness, and new treatments with innovative mechanisms would be valuable. In this pilot study, the authors tested whether a single subanesthetic infusion of ketamine administered to adults with alcohol dependence and engaged in motivational enhancement therapy affects drinking outcomes. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to a 52-minute intravenous administration of ketamine (0.71 mg/kg, N=17) or the active control midazolam (0.025 mg/kg, N=23), provided during the second week of a 5-week outpatient regimen of motivational enhancement therapy. Alcohol use following the infusion was assessed with timeline followback method, with abstinence confirmed by urine ethyl glucuronide testing. A longitudinal logistic mixed-effects model was used to model daily abstinence from alcohol over the 21 days after ketamine infusion. RESULTS: Participants (N=40) were mostly middle-aged (mean age=53 years [SD=9.8]), predominantly white (70.3%), and largely employed (71.8%) and consumed an average of five drinks per day prior to entering the study. Ketamine significantly increased the likelihood of abstinence, delayed the time to relapse, and reduced the likelihood of heavy drinking days compared with midazolam. Infusions were well tolerated, with no participants removed from the study as a result of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: A single ketamine infusion was found to improve measures of drinking in persons with alcohol dependence engaged in motivational enhancement therapy. These preliminary data suggest new directions in integrated pharmacotherapy-behavioral treatments for alcohol use disorder.

1850,"Neuronal correlates of visual and auditory alertness in the DMT and ketamine model of psychosis.^\nDeficits in attentional functions belong to the core cognitive symptoms in schizophrenic patients. Alertness is a nonselective attention component that refers to a state of general readiness that improves stimulus processing and response initiation. The main goal of the present study was to investigate cerebral correlates of alertness in the human 5HT(2A) agonist and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) antagonist model of psychosis. Fourteen healthy volunteers participated in a randomized double-blind, cross-over event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study with dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and S-ketamine. A target detection task with cued and uncued trials in both the visual and the auditory modality was used. Administration of DMT led to decreased blood oxygenation level-dependent response during performance of an alertness task, particularly in extrastriate regions during visual alerting and in temporal regions during auditory alerting. In general, the effects for the visual modality were more pronounced. In contrast, administration of S-ketamine led to increased cortical activation in the left insula and precentral gyrus in the auditory modality. The results of the present study might deliver more insight into potential differences and overlapping pathomechanisms in schizophrenia. These conclusions must remain preliminary and should be explored by further fMRI studies with schizophrenic patients performing modality-specific alertness tasks.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.005143037531524897, 0.9848741888999939, 0.01607849821448326, 0.004503024276345968]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

A mixed-methods design was used comparing treatment responders versus non-responders, as well as content coding of themes from open-ended questions. Most participants reported positive persisting effects of ibogaine detoxification (e.g., enhanced personal sense of gratitude and authenticity, and meaning and appreciation for life). Compared to non-responders, treatment responders endorsed greater persisting changes in their ability to tolerate difficult/painful feelings, capacity for coping with stress, and reduced unhealthy anger. Treatment responders reported greater change in subjective levels of inner peace, joy, feelings of love/openheartedness, and experiences of sacredness in life. Qualitative analyses revealed that treatment responders reported a heightened sense of spiritual awareness and greater connection to their intra-/interpersonal relationships after ibogaine detoxification. Notable challenges of ibogaine detoxification included psychological and health-related difficulties during treatment and challenges with post-treatment integration.

A Latent Class Analysis of a Convenience Sample of Dutch Young Adults.^\nIntroduction: This study offers insights into Dutch young people's expected social and personal consequences of ecstasy use. Substance use expectancies are assumed to be an essential component in explaining substance use behaviour and, therefore, the development of effective substance use prevention and treatment strategies. Method: Dutch young adults with an online interest in drug-related social media posts were targeted with an online survey about their use of alcohol and drugs. This resulted in a convenience sample (N = 4182, 73.4% female, M<sub>age</sub> = 21.11), of which 35.5% had used ecstasy at least once in their life and 29.3% had used ecstasy last year. Latent class analyses were used to identify subgroups based on both positive and negative expectancies of ecstasy use. Cross-class differences were examined using multinomial logistic regression. Results: This study yielded four distinct classes: only negative expectancies (13.6%), high positive and negative expectancies (23.5%), low to moderate positive and negative expectancies (20.6%), and mostly positive expectancies (22.4%). These classes differed significantly in lifetime experience with ecstasy use, intention to use ecstasy, perception of harmfulness and availability, and social norms regarding the use of ecstasy. Conclusion: Findings show that ecstasy use expectancies can be used to create meaningful classes of users and non-users, and that these classes are different enough to warrant varied prevention approaches. Expectancies young people have regarding the use of ecstasy are associated with various ecstasy use-related variables and should be taken into consideration when developing and implementing preventive interventions.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.03210470825433731, 0.9845102429389954, 0.011949697509407997, 0.005672465544193983]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

However, a detailed analysis of LSD effects on nuclei-resolved thalamocortical connectivity is still missing. Here, in a group of healthy volunteers, we evaluated whether LSD intake alters the thalamocortical coupling in a nucleus-specific manner. Structural and resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data were acquired in a placebo-controlled study on subjects exposed to acute LSD administration. Structural MRI was used to parcel the thalamus into its constituent nuclei based on individual anatomy. Nucleus-specific changes of resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) connectivity were mapped using a seed-based approach. LSD intake selectively increased the thalamocortical functional connectivity (FC) of the ventral complex, pulvinar, and non-specific nuclei. Functional coupling was increased between these nuclei and sensory cortices that include the somatosensory and auditory networks. The ventral and pulvinar nuclei also exhibited increased FC with parts of the associative cortex that are dense in serotonin type 2A receptors. These areas are hyperactive and hyper-connected upon LSD intake. At subcortical levels, LSD increased the functional coupling among the thalamus's ventral, pulvinar, and non-specific nuclei, but decreased the striatal-thalamic connectivity. These findings unravel some LSD effects on the modulation of subcortical-cortical circuits and associated behavioral outputs.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0047830855473876, 0.9831546545028687, 0.017778515815734863, 0.004857477732002735]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
2105,"Acute dose-response effects of LSD in healthy humans.^\nBackground: LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) is a classic hallucinogen. It was widely studied in the 1950s to 1970s as an adjunct to psychotherapy (psycholytic therapy) and as a model to study psychotic states. Today, LSD is again in the focus of several investigations ranging from pharmacological research studies in healthy subjects [1‐3] to studies investigating LSD as a possible treatment for anxiety associated with terminal illness [4]. Because of the continued popularity of LSD as recreational drug and renewed interest in its therapeutic use we examined the acute response to two different doses of LSD in healthy subjects under controlled conditions. Methods: Data from two double‐blind, placebo controlled experimental studies were used to establish dose‐response relationships. Study 1 investigated the effects of 100mg LSD vs. Placebo and study 2 investigated the effects of 200mg LSD vs. Placebo. Both studies were performed in a cross‐over design. Twenty‐four subjects (12 men, 12 women; mean age 33±11 years) participated in Study 1, and 16 subjects (8 men, 8 women; mean Age 29±6 years) participated in Study 2. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were identical for both studies. Subjects younger than 25 years of age were excluded from participating in the study. Additional exclusion criteria were age >65 years, pregnancy, personal or family history of major psychiatric disorders, use of medications that may interfere with the study medication, chronic or acute physical illness, tobacco smoking (>10 cigarettes/day), and a lifetime prevalence of illicit drug use >10 times. Subjective effects were measured using validated psychometric tools including visual analog scales, adjective mood rating scale and the altered states of consciousness scale. Heart rate, blood pressure, and pupil size were also recorded. Further, we measured plasma concentration of LSD and its main metabolites in both studies to investigate pharmacokinetic ‐ pharmacodynamic relationships. Results: LSD produced positively‐experienced derealization and depersonalization and visual restructuralization including synaesthesia after 100 μg and 200 LSD in a dose‐dependent manner. Additionally, LSD produced empathic effects such as “closeness” “openness”, and “trust”. Empathic effects were found higher after 200 μg than after 100 μg. Subjective effects after 200 μg lasted up to 12 hours, and up to 10 hours after 100 μg. Negative associated effects, mainly transient anxiety, were more pronounced under 200 μg than after 100 μg. LSD did also moderately increase systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body temperature, and pupil size. LSD did not produce fearful reactions or negative experiences in this controlled setting. Conclusion: LSD induced mainly positive subjective effects in a dose‐dependent manner in a controlled laboratory setting in healthy subjects. Our findings show that 100 μg and 200 μg of LSD induce empathic effects to different degrees which is an important finding regarding its potential use in psycholytic therapy.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.005763573572039604, 0.9880010485649109, 0.015598651021718979, 0.0050164926797151566]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

Long-term use was associated with thinning of the posterior cingulate cortex, thickening of the anterior cingulate cortex, and decreased neocortical 5-HT2A receptor binding. Despite the high methodological heterogeneity and the small sample sizes, the results suggest that hallucinogens increase introspection and positive mood by modulating brain activity in the fronto-temporo-parieto-occipital cortex.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.05959535762667656, 0.06613197922706604, 0.04549334943294525, 0.9594529271125793]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]"
2225,"Acute psychomotor, memory and subjective effects of MDMA and THC co-administration over time in healthy volunteers.^\nIn Western societies a considerable percentage of young people expose themselves to the combination of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or 'ecstasy') and cannabis. The aim of the present study was to assess the acute effects of co-administration of MDMA and THC (the main psychoactive compound of cannabis) on pharmacokinetics, psychomotor performance, memory and subjective experience over time. We performed a four-way, double blind, randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled study in 16 healthy volunteers (12 male, four female) between the ages of 18 and 27. MDMA (100 mg) was given orally, THC (4, 6, and 6 mg, interval of 90 min) was vaporized and inhaled. THC induced more robust cognitive impairment compared with MDMA, and co-administration did not exacerbate single drug effects on cognitive function. However, co-administration of THC with MDMA increased desired subjective drug effects and drug strength compared with the MDMA condition, which may explain the widespread use of this combination.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.013378535397350788, 0.9871925115585327, 0.011642064899206161, 0.004780314397066832]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
2301,"Long-term outcomes of psychoactive drug use in trauma patients: A multicenter patient-reported outcomes study.^\nINTRODUCTION: Psychoactive drug use (PDU) is reported in up to 40% of trauma patients and is associated with a higher rate of in-hospital complications. However, little is known about its long-term impact on trauma patients. We aimed to assess the long-term functional, mental, and psychosocial outcomes of PDU in trauma patients 6 to 12 months after injury. METHODS: Trauma patients with moderate to severe injuries (Injury Severity Score, >9) who had a toxicology screen upon admission to one of three level 1 trauma centers were contacted by phone 6 to 12 months postinjury. Psychoactive drug use was defined as the presence of a psychoactive, nonprescribed substance on toxicology screen including amphetamine, barbiturate, benzodiazepine, cannabinoid, methamphetamine, methadone, opioid, oxycodone, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy), phencyclidine, tricyclic antidepressant, and cocaine. The interviews systematically evaluated functional limitations, social functioning, chronic pain, and mental health (posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety). Patients with a score of ≤47 on the Short-Form Health Survey version 2.0 social functioning subdomain were considered to have social dysfunction. Multivariable regression models were built to determine the independent association between PDU and long-term outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 1,699 eligible patients, 571 (34%) were included in the analysis, and 173 (30.3%) screened positive for PDU on admission. Patients with PDU were younger (median age [interquartile range], 43 [28-55] years vs. 66 [46-78] years, p < 0.001), had more penetrating injuries (8.7% vs. 4.3%, p = 0.036), and were less likely to have received a college education (41.3% vs. 54.5%, p = 0.004). After adjusting for patients' characteristics including the presence of a baseline psychiatric comorbidity, patients with PDU on admission were more likely to suffer from daily chronic pain, mental health disorders, and social dysfunction 6 to 12 months after injury. There was no difference in the functional limitations between patients with and without PDU. CONCLUSION: On the long term, PDU in trauma patients is strongly and independently associated with worse mental health, more chronic pain, and severe impairment in social functioning. A trauma hospitalization presents an opportunity to identify patients at risk and to mitigate the long-term impact of PDU on recovery.

2912,"Safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic evaluation of a noribogaine multiple-dose regimen in opioid-dependent subjects.^\nOpioid dependence is a significant public health issue. Improved non‐addictive, non‐opioid treatments to help opioid‐dependent individuals stop opioid use and remain abstinent are needed. Ibogaine has been explored as treatment for substance dependence, but its psychotomimetic effects limit its clinical utility. Noribogaine is an active metabolite of ibogaine and may be more selective in treating opioid dependence without undesirable psychotomimetic effects. Previous clinical studies evaluated single doses of noribogaine and suggested that it is safe and well‐tolerated, but with a concentration‐dependent increase in the QTc interval. This study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of noribogaine HCl capsules after multiple dosing in treatment‐seeking opioid‐dependent subjects. Background: The development of treatments for opioid dependence, a significant public health issue, is of high importance. Educational objectives include: (1) describe noribogaine as a potential non‐addictive, non‐opioid treatment for opioid dependence, (2) examine the utility of a predefined dosing algorithm to avoid pronounced QTc prolongation (QTcF >500 msec or ΔQTcF >60 msec) in multiple dose studies of drugs that exhibit a concentration‐dependent increase in the QTc interval, (3) recognize the importance of conducting controlled clinical trials in the opioid‐dependent population while acknowledging the challenges of studying this population. Methods: This was a phase 1B, open‐label, titration study conducted in an inpatient clinical unit. A loading dose of oral noribogaine 80 mg was followed by titrated maintenance dosing (10, 20, 30, or 40 mg, q6h) for up to 5 days. Maintenance dosing considered subjective and objective clinical assessments and QTcF using a predefined algorithm to avoid pronounced QT prolongation (QTcF >500 msec or ΔQTcF >60 msec was exclusionary). Standard safety evaluations, PK, and PD assessments (eg, opioid withdrawal and mood scales) were conducted. Continuous cardiac monitoring was performed via Holter monitor and telemetry. Results: Nine subjects (6 males; mean age 31.2 years) were enrolled. Documented opioid use included heroin and prescription opioids. Cumulative noribogaine doses ranged from 80mg to 670 mg, with 4 subjects administered the maximum 20 doses (mean 653 mg, range 640‐670 mg). No serious adverse events (AEs) were reported. Of treatmentemergent AEs, 96% were mild in severity, none were severe and 58% were opioid withdrawal‐related. Noribogaine plasma concentrations showed high intersubject variability, even between subjects with similar unit/daily/total doses. Cmax values following multiple dosing ranging from 52 to 252 (mean 102) ng/mL. After oral administration of noribogaine, observed plasma concentrations over time were consistent with an open, 2 compartment first‐order absorption model. Steady‐state was reached between 12 and 24 hours in a majority of subjects (5) and within 48 hours for the remaining (2). The largest ΔQTcF by subject ranged from 22‐51 msec (mean 33 msec). A concentration‐dependent increase in DQTcF was observed, corresponding to a predicted ΔQTcF of 17 msec at the geometric mean peak concentration of 89.1 ng/mL. No QTc changes resulted in AEs or discontinuation. Scores on withdrawal and mood scales decreased rapidly and substantially following administration of noribogaine, and this was supported by non‐solicited self‐reports that the withdrawal experience was less severe compared with previous attempts in the majority of subjects. Mean (SD) SOWS score at baseline was 30.3 (10.6) and declined to 16.8 (7.4) one hour after loading dose administration; at 51 hours post‐loading dose, mean SOWS score was 10.4 (9.7). Mean (SD) POMS total mood disturbance (TMD) score was 53.8 (22.2) at baseline and declined to 37.3 (43.3) at 57 hours post‐loading dose. Consistent with the expected time course of opioid withdrawal, 3 subjects experienced an increase in withdrawal symptoms 48‐72 h post the last pre‐t eatment opioid administration (mean of 11 h prior to noribogaine loading dose), 2 of whom withdrew from the study. All 4 subjects who remained in the clinic after 72 hours experienced further decreases in withdrawal and mood scores (SOWS: 4.8 (4.9) at 81 h; POMS TMD: 0.8 (4.6) at 84 h). Subjects returned to their pre‐treatment environment, largely devoid of support; 5 subjects relapsed, 3 were lost to follow‐up, and 1 remained abstinent (15 weeks). Conclusions: Noribogaine treatment for up to 5 days was well tolerated. The previously noted QTc effect was confirmed, and a dosing algorithm with QTc criteria was successful in avoiding pronounced QTc prolongation (i.e., no QTcF>500 msec or ΔQTcF >60 msec). Steady‐state noribogaine concentrations were reached rapidly with the use of a loading dose. Clinically significant reductions in withdrawal symptoms and mood assessments were seen following noribogaine administration. These findings support continued evaluation of noribogaine in treating opioid dependence under medical supervision in controlled clinical trials. Educational Objectives: At the conclusions of this activity, participants should be able to: 1. Describe noribogaine as a potential non‐addictive, nonopioid treatment for opioid dependence. 2. Examine the utility of a predefined dosing algorithm to avoid pronounced QTc prolongation. 3. Recognize the importance/challenge of conducting controlled clinical trials in the opioid‐dependents.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.006770160980522633, 0.9883460402488708, 0.013325128704309464, 0.005007387604564428]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
2957,"Glutamatergic Signaling Drives Ketamine-Mediated Response in Depression: Evidence from Dynamic Causal Modeling.^\nBACKGROUND: The glutamatergic modulator ketamine has rapid antidepressant effects in individuals with major depressive disorder and bipolar depression. Thus, modulating glutamatergic transmission may be critical to effectively treating depression, though the mechanisms by which this occurs are not fully understood. METHODS: This double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study analyzed data from 18 drug-free major depressive disorder subjects and 18 heathy controls who received a single i.v. infusion of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) as well as an i.v. saline placebo. Magnetoencephalographic recordings were collected prior to the first infusion and 6 to 9 hours after both ketamine and placebo infusions. During scanning, participants passively received tactile stimulation to the right index finger. Antidepressant response was assessed across timepoints using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. Dynamic causal modeling was used to measure changes in α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA)- and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-mediated connectivity estimates in major depressive disorder subjects and controls using a simple model of somatosensory evoked responses. RESULTS: Both major depressive disorder and healthy subjects showed ketamine-mediated NMDA-blockade sensitization, with major depressive disorder subjects showing enhanced NMDA connectivity estimates in backward connections and controls showing enhanced NMDA connectivity estimates in forward connections in our model. Within our major depressive disorder subject group, ketamine efficacy, as measured by improved mood ratings, correlated with reduced NMDA and AMPA connectivity estimates in discrete extrinsic connections within the somatosensory cortical network. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that AMPA- and NMDA-mediated glutamatergic signaling play a key role in antidepressant response to ketamine and, further, that dynamic causal modeling is a powerful tool for modeling AMPA- and NMDA-mediated connectivity in vivo.

3257,"Efficacy and safety of perioperative application of ketamine on postoperative depression: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies.^\nKetamine, a commonly used general anesthetic, can produce rapid and sustained antidepressant effect. However, the efficacy and safety of the perioperative application of ketamine on postoperative depression remains uncertain. We performed a meta-analysis to determine the effect of perioperative intravenous administration of ketamine on postoperative depression. Randomized controlled trials comparing ketamine with placebo in patients were included. Primary outcome was postoperative depression scores. Secondary outcomes included postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain and adverse effects associated with ketamine. Fifteen studies with 1697 patients receiving ketamine and 1462 controls were enrolled. Compared with the controls, the ketamine group showed a reduction in postoperative depression scores, by a standardized mean difference (SMD) of -0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI, -1.27, -0.66], P < 0.001, I(2) = 72% on postoperative day (POD) 1; SMD-0.65, 95% CI [-1.12, -0.17], P < 0.001, I(2) = 94% on POD 3; SMD-0.30, 95% CI [-0.45, -0.14], P < 0.001, I(2) = 0% on POD 7; and SMD-0.25, 95% CI [-0.38, -0.11], P < 0.001, I(2) = 59% over the long term. Ketamine reduced VAS pain scores on POD 1 (SMD-0.93, 95% CI [-1.58, -0.29], P = 0.005, I(2) = 97%), but no significant difference was found between the two groups on PODs 3 and 7 or over the long term. However, ketamine administration distinctly increased the risk of adverse effects, including nausea and vomiting (risk ratio [RR] 1.40, 95% CI [1.12, 1.75], P = 0.003, I(2) = 30%), headache (RR 2.47, 95% CI [1.41, 4.32], P = 0.002, I(2) = 19%), hallucination (RR 15.35, 95% CI [6.(2)4, 37.34], P < 0.001, I(2) = 89%), and dizziness (RR 3.48, 95% CI [2.68, 4.50], P < 0.001, I(2) = 89%) compared with the controls.

3353,"Efficacy of ketamine in the rapid treatment of major depressive disorder: A meta-analysis of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies.^\nBackground: An increasing number of studies are reporting that ketamine could be treated as a novel antidepressant for major depressive disorder (MDD). Therefore, we performed this meta-analysis to comprehensively and systematically assess the efficacy of ketamine for treating patients with MDD. Method: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies on ketamine versus placebo for treating MDD were searched up to April 2016 in medical databases (PubMed, CCTR, Web of Science, Embase, CBM-disc, and CNKI). Three treatment time points (24 and 72 h, and day 7) were chosen. Response and remission rates were the main outcomes. The random effects model was used. An intention-to-treat analysis was conducted. Results: Nine high-quality studies that included 368 patients were selected to compare the efficacy of ketamine to placebo. The therapeutic effects of ketamine at 24 and 72 h, and day 7 were found to be significantly better than placebo. Response and remission rates in the ketamine group at 24 and 72 h, and day 7 were 52.2% and 20.6%; 47.9% and 23.8%; and 39.8% and 26.2%, respectively. No significant heterogeneity existed, and the Egger’s test showed no publication bias. Conclusion: These results indicated that ketamine could yield a good efficacy in the rapid treatment of MDD. Future large-scale clinical studies are needed to confirm our results and investigate the mid- and long-term efficacy of ketamine in treating MDD.

3661,"Incidence and patterns of polydrug use and craving for ecstasy in regular ecstasy users: An ecological momentary assessment study.^\nBackground: Previous studies employing retrospective assessments methods found that regular ecstasy users frequently use alcohol, marihuana and other drugs in combination with ecstasy. Methods: Twenty-two participants (13 males, 9 females) wore a wrist actigraph/data recorder to record real-time drug use and ecstasy craving for 6 weeks. Rates of alcohol and drug use on ecstasy use versus non-use nights, and before, during, and after ecstasy use were analyzed with generalized estimation equations (GEE). Craving was modeled with GEE and linear mixed models. Results: Approximately 70% of ecstasy uses occurred on Friday or Saturday nights. No drug was significantly more likely to be used on ecstasy use nights than comparison Friday and Saturday nights. On nights ecstasy was used, in general across all drugs assessed, use was more likely before and during than after ecstasy intoxication, while alcohol use was also more likely before than during ecstasy intoxication. Though low overall, craving for ecstasy increased over 24 h before use and was higher on Friday nights of weeks ecstasy was used on weekends than weeks it was not used. Conclusions: Use of ecstasy on a particular night may not be associated with any greater likelihood of using any other intoxicating drug, and use of other drugs on nights involving ecstasy use may simply reflect a ""natural history"" of drug-use nights that begins with alcohol, progresses to more intoxicating drugs, and ends with little drug use.

Psychotomimetic, perceptual, cognitive, and neuroendocrine responses.^\nBACKGROUND: To characterize further behavioral, cognitive, neuroendocrine, and physiological effects of subanesthetic doses of ketamine hydrochloride in healthy human subjects. Ketamine, a phencyclidine hydrochloride derivative, is a dissociative anesthetic and a noncompetitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of excitatory amino acid receptor. METHODS: Nineteen healthy subjects recruited by advertisements from the community participated in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Subjects completed three test days involving the 40-minute intravenous administration of placebo, ketamine hydrochloride (0.1 mg/kg), or ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg). Behaviors associated with the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia were assessed by using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Changes in perception and behaviors associated with dissociative states were assessed by the Perceptual Aberration Subscale of the Wisconsin Psychosis Proneness Scale and the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale. Cognitive function was assessed by using the (1) Mini-Mental State Examination; (2) tests sensitive to frontal cortical dysfunction, including a continuous performance vigilance task, a verbal fluency task, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; and (3) tests of immediate and delayed recall. Plasma levels of cortisol, prolactin, homovanillic acid, and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethyleneglycol were measured. RESULTS: Ketamine (1) produced behaviors similar to the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia; (2) elicited alterations in perception; (3) impaired performance on tests of vigilance, verbal fluency, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; (4) evoked symptoms similar to dissociative states; and (5) preferentially disrupted delayed word recall, sparing immediate recall and postdistraction recall. Ketamine had no significant effect on the Mini-Mental State Examination at the doses studied. Ketamine also had no effect on plasma 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethyleneglycol levels, although it blunted a test day decline in plasma homovanillic acid levels at the higher dose. It also dose dependently increased plasma cortisol and prolactin levels. Ketamine produced small dose-dependent increases in blood pressure.

The gene coding for this transporter determines the expression rate of the transporter. Previously it was shown that healthy individuals with the short allelic variant ('s-group') of the 5-HTTLPR-polymorphism displayed more anxiety and negative mood, and had a lower transcriptional efficiency compared to individuals who are homozygous for the l-allele ('l-group'). The present study aimed to investigate the role of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism in MDMA-induced mood effects.

Mood was assessed by means of the Profile of Mood States. Findings showed that MDMA induced -independent of sex- a positive mood state, and as a side effect also increased two negative affect states, anxiety and confusion. Anxiety ratings were higher in the l-group and independent of treatment or sex. Depression ratings were lowered by MDMA in the female l-group.

4658,"Study protocol for ""MDMA-assisted therapy as a treatment for major depressive disorder: A proof of principle study"".^\nBACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a world-leading cause of disability. The available treatments are not effective in all patients, and there is a significant need for more effective treatment options. Here we present the protocol for an investigator-initiated and publicly funded trial of MDMA-assisted therapy (MDMA-AT) for MDD. This single-site, open-label study investigates the proof of principle and safety of MDMA-AT in participants with MDD and provides an initial impression of treatment effectiveness. METHODS: A total of 12 participants [>18 years] with DSM-5 diagnosis of MDD will receive a flexible dose of MDMA in a therapeutic setting on two dosing days over a 4 week period preceded by three preparatory sessions. Each MDMA dosing session will be followed by three integration sessions. The primary outcome is change in MDD symptom severity, as measured by the mean change in MADRS scores from Baseline to 8 weeks after the second MDMA session. The secondary outcome is change in functional impairment, as evaluated by the mean change in Sheehan Disability Scale scores from Baseline to 8 weeks after the second MDMA session.

4678,"Classic Psychedelic Use and Mechanisms of Mental Health: Exploring the Mediating Roles of Spirituality and Emotion Processing on Symptoms of Anxiety, Depressed Mood, and Disordered Eating in a Community Sample.^\nA resurgence of research has begun to systematically examine the relationship between psychedelic use and mental health and well-being. Although preliminary findings examining the therapeutic value of these substances show promise, the mechanisms through which psychedelic use may predict reduced mental distress remain poorly understood. To this end, we surveyed a community sample of individuals (n = 159) who endorsed lifetime psychedelic use to examine relationships among psychedelic use and self-reported spirituality, difficulties in emotion regulation, and symptoms of mental health issues. Results revealed a pathway through which classic psychedelic use predicted greater spirituality, which in turn predicted better emotion regulation, ultimately predicting lower levels of anxiety, depressed mood, and disordered eating. These results contribute to our understanding of potential mechanisms of change with respect to psychedelics and mental health. They also add to the growing body of literature pointing to the healing effects of the cultivation of spirituality and emotion regulation as separate and related constructs.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.006904792971909046, 0.9822905659675598, 0.017627742141485214, 0.005431508645415306]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
4684,"Long-term outcome of patients who receive ketamine during research.^\nBACKGROUND: To comprehend the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and to facilitate drug discovery, animal and human models of schizophrenia are necessary. Ketamine, a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, has been used to probe glutamatergic function in normal and schizophrenic volunteers. These studies and others have provided data consistent with a putative involvement of a glutamatergic dysfunction in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia; however, these studies have also raised concerns about the distress inflicted on patients, the potential for adverse events, and the serious long-term effects that could possibly be induced by symptom-simulating action. METHODS: For all patient volunteers (n = 30) who participated in these studies, we reviewed the acute safety during and in the immediate postketamine administration. Patients available for long-term follow-up (n = 25) were matched to a group of patients (n = 25) who participated in research but did not receive ketamine. We compared their long-term outcome in terms of psychopathology, the need for psychiatric care, and the amount of antipsychotic medication required for optimal therapeutic response. RESULTS: There were no serious adverse events in more than 90 ketamine interviews. Distress to patients was minimal, which is shown by the lack of anxiety ratings. Over a mean follow-up period of 8 months, we found no differences between patients who did and did not receive ketamine on any measures of psychopathology, psychiatric care, or the amount of antipsychotic medication. CONCLUSIONS: In a controlled environment and paying close attention to subject safety features, administering subanesthetic doses of ketamine causes no adverse events and little distress to schizophrenic volunteers. This study strongly indicates that administering ketamine does not change any aspect of the course of schizophrenic illness.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.006148552987724543, 0.9868287444114685, 0.014999698847532272, 0.004796849098056555]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
4701,"Dissociable effects of a single dose of ecstasy (MDMA) on psychomotor skills and attentional performance.^\nEcstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA) is a psychoactive recreational drug widely used by young people visiting dance parties, and has been associated with poor cognitive function. The current study assessed the influence of a single dose of MDMA 75 mg and alcohol 0.5 g/kg on cognition, psychomotor performance and driving-related task performance. Twelve healthy recreational ecstasy users participated in an experimental study conducted according to a double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled three-way cross-over design. MDMA improved psychomotor performance, such as movement speed and tracking performance in a single task, as well as in a divided attention task. MDMA impaired the ability to predict object movement under divided attention. However, the inability to accurately predict object movement after MDMA may indicate impairment of particular performance skills relevant to driving.

4761,"Differential contributions of serotonergic and dopaminergic functional connectivity to the phenomenology of LSD.^\nRATIONALE: LSD is the prototypical psychedelic. Despite a clear central role of the 5HT(2a) receptor in its mechanism of action, the contributions of additional receptors for which it shows affinity and agonist activity remain unclear. OBJECTIVES: We employed receptor-enriched analysis of functional connectivity by targets (REACT) to explore differences in functional connectivity (FC) associated with the distributions of the primary targets of LSD-the 5HT(1a), 5HT(1b), 5HT(2a), D1 and D2 receptors. METHODS: We performed secondary analyses of an openly available dataset (N = 15) to estimate the LSD-induced alterations in receptor-enriched FC maps associated with these systems. Principal component analysis (PCA) was employed as a dimension reduction strategy for subjective experiences associated with LSD captured by the Altered States of Consciousness (ASC) questionnaire. Correlations between these principal components as well as VAS ratings of subjective effects with receptor-enriched FC were explored. RESULTS: Compared to placebo, LSD produced differences in FC when the analysis was enriched with each of the primary serotonergic and dopaminergic receptors. Altered receptor-enriched FC showed relationships with the subjective effects of LSD on conscious experience, with serotonergic and dopaminergic systems being predominantly associated with perceptual effects and perceived selfhood as well as cognition respectively. These relationships were dissociable, with different receptors showing the same relationships within, but not between, the serotonergic and dopaminergic systems.

Methods Ten participants were randomised to receive a 96-h ketamine infusion, titrated as tolerated to a target rate of 0.6 mg/kg/h, while 10 received a 40-min ketamine infusion (0.5 mg/kg). Both groups received clonidine, titrated to a maximum of 0.6 mg orally daily, during the infusion to mitigate side effects of ketamine. Participants were followed for 8 weeks to examine potential antidepressant effects. Results All 20 participants completed the infusion. Most participants tolerated the infusion well, with minimal psychotomimetic symptoms or blood pressure elevation despite achieving high ketamine concentrations (mean 424 ng/ml for 96-h arm, 156 ng/ml for 40-min arm). There was no rebound hypertension upon discontinuing clonidine. Rapid and sustained improvement in depressive symptoms was observed in both study groups. Higher ketamine concentration was associated with sustained antidepressant response, and was not with greater psychotomimetic side effects, in the 96-h arm. Conclusions This study provides evidence for the feasibility of prolonged ketamine infusions in treatment-resistant depression. Co-administration of clonidine appeared to mitigate ketamine's psychotomimetic effects. Further study is required to investigate the extent to which prolonged ketamine infusions could provide both rapid and sustained improvements in treatment-resistant depression.

5025,"Does body mass index predict response to intravenous ketamine treatment in adults with major depressive and bipolar disorder? Results from the Canadian Rapid Treatment Center of Excellence.^\nBACKGROUND: Higher body mass index (BMI) has been found to predict greater antidepressant response to intravenous (IV) ketamine treatment. We evaluated the association between BMI and response to repeat-dose IV ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). METHODS: Adults (N = 230) with TRD received four infusions of IV ketamine at a community-based clinic. Changes in symptoms of depression (ie, Quick Inventory for Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report 16; QIDS-SR16), suicidal ideation (SI; ie, QIDS-SR16 SI item), anxiety (ie, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale), anhedonic severity (ie, Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale), and functioning (ie, Sheehan Disability Scale) following infusions were evaluated. Participants were stratified by BMI as normal (18.0-24.9 kg/m2; n = 72), overweight (25-29.9 kg/m2; n = 76), obese I (30-34.9 kg/m2; n = 47), or obese II (≥35.0 kg/m2; n = 35). RESULTS: Similar antidepressant effects with repeat-dose ketamine were reported between BMI groups (P = .261). In addition, categorical partial response (P = .149), response (P = .526), and remission (P = .232) rates were similar between the four BMI groups.

5680,"Intravenous ketamine relieves pain and depression after traumatic suicide attempts: A case series.^\nThe letter presents a series of cases where, after traumatic suicide attempts, authors administered intravenous doses of ketamine to decrease pain and acute suicidal thoughts. The first case is an 81-year-old man who presented with a suicide attempt involving self-inflicted neck laceration and left wrist laceration. On initial psychiatric consultation, it was discovered that the patient had been holding a delusional belief that he and his wife were developing dementia. After discussion with the patient, family, and surgical specialists, it was decided that the patient was not medically stable for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and pharmacotherapy was initiated to target symptoms of depression and psychosis using venlafaxine, mirtazapine, and aripiprazole on hospital day 3. The second case is also an elderly man who presented with a suicide attempt involving self-inflicted bilateral orbit trauma. The treatment team decided to start him on venlafaxine and mirtazapine with a rapid titration to doses of 225 mg and 30 mg, respectively. In this set of 2 cases, we have provided strong evidence of the utility of intravenous ketamine for treatment of comorbid pain, depression, and suicidal ideation after traumatic suicide attempts. This combines the traditional use of ketamine as an anesthetic with newly discovered antidepressant and antisuicidal properties. In these 2 cases, symptom relief was the desired outcome of treatment, and by this metric, the use of ketamine was a success in these patients in terms of management of pain, depression, and suicidality. Of note, both patients in this series were elderly and diagnosed as having MDD with psychotic features. These patients did not have any exacerbation of psychosis and rather appeared to lessen these symptoms, possibly by exerting treatment of their underlying depression. These treatments were given in the clinical setting, and outcomes were measured by clinicians and thus not subject to rigorous scientific scrutiny one would see in the setting of a clinical trial. This case series bolsters the ongoing discussion of how to best use intravenous administration of ketamine to treat psychiatric disorders, particularly when comorbid pain is present and/or ECT is unavailable.

Over two decades later, this study is the first completed clinical trial evaluating MDMA as a therapeutic adjunct. Twenty patients with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder, refractory to both psychotherapy and psychopharmacology, were randomly assigned to psychotherapy with concomitant active drug (n = 12) or inactive placebo (n = 8) administered during two 8-h experimental psychotherapy sessions. Both groups received preparatory and follow-up non-drug psychotherapy. The primary outcome measure was the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, administered at baseline, 4 days after each experimental session, and 2 months after the second session. Neurocognitive testing, blood pressure, and temperature monitoring were performed. After 2-month follow-up, placebo subjects were offered the option to re-enroll in the experimental procedure with open-label MDMA. Decrease in Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale scores from baseline was significantly greater for the group that received MDMA than for the placebo group at all three time points after baseline. The rate of clinical response was 10/12 (83%) in the active treatment group versus 2/8 (25%) in the placebo group. There were no drug-related serious adverse events, adverse neurocognitive effects or clinically significant blood pressure increases.

5928,"Evidence that subanesthetic doses of ketamine cause sustained disruptions of NMDA and AMPA-mediated frontoparietal connectivity in humans.^\nFollowing the discovery of the antidepressant properties of ketamine, there has been a recent resurgence in the interest in this NMDA receptor antagonist. Although detailed animal models of the molecular mechanisms underlying ketamine’s effects have emerged, there are few MEG/EEG studies examining the acute subanesthetic effects of ketamine infusion in man. We recorded 275 channel MEG in two experiments (n = 25 human males) examining the effects of subanesthetic ketamine infusion. MEG power spectra revealed a rich set of significant oscillatory changes compared with placebo sessions, including decreases in occipital, parietal, and anterior cingulate alpha power, increases in medial frontal theta power, and increases in parietal and cingulate cortex high gamma power. Each of these spectral effects demonstrated their own set of temporal dynamics. Dynamic causal modeling of frontoparietal connectivity changes with ketamine indicated a decrease in NMDA and AMPA-mediated frontal-to-parietal connectivity. AMPA-mediated connectivity changes were sustained for up to 50 min after ketamine infusion had ceased, by which time perceptual distortions were absent. The results also indicated a decrease in gain of parietal pyramidal cells, which was correlated with participants’ self-reports of blissful state. Based on these results, we suggest that the antidepressant effects of ketamine may depend on its ability to change the balance of frontoparietal connectivity patterns.

Ten in-patients with neuropathic pain participated in this single-blind, placebo-controlled study after giving written informed consent. Following intravenous injections of a saline solution (placebo), three bolus injections of 5 mg ketamine HCl were administered at 5 min intervals. Changes in pain perception were assessed using a numerical rating scale for pain. Behavioral changes, including psychotomimetic effects, were assessed using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Electroencephalograms (EEG) and electrooculograms (EOG) were recorded continuously throughout the testing period. One minute EEG and closed-eye eye movements were quantified. The effects of ketamine were evaluated by comparing the neurophysiological and behavioral parameters obtained from the placebo and ketamine trials. Pain reduction was significantly correlated with ketamine-induced changes in hallucinatory behavior and excitement as measured by the BPRS. Ketamine injections caused a significant decrease in the EEGalpha amplitude without an accompanying reduction in EEG frequency. The EEGalpha amplitude reduction at the right central electrode was significantly related to subjective pain relief. Subanesthetic doses of ketamine significantly decreased rapid eye movements, but did not initiate slow eye movements. In conclusion, the present EEG-EOG/behavioral results indicate that ketamine-induced failure of neural integration between cortical-subcortical regions induces psychotic symptoms and alters pain perception on neuropathic pain.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.005262319464236498, 0.9861422181129456, 0.015411630272865295, 0.005274706985801458]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

We examined trends in past-year drug use within this population to better inform prevention and harm reduction efforts. METHODS: Each summer from 2016 through 2019, we used time-space sampling to survey a cross-section of adults entering EDM parties at randomly selected nightclubs and at dance festivals in New York City. Ns ranged from 504 (2019) to 1,087 (2016). We estimated log-linear trends in past-year use of 16 different synthetic drugs or drug classes. RESULTS: Between 2016 and 2019, estimated past-year prevalence of use of ketamine increased from 5.9% to 15.3% (a 157.6% relative increase; P = .007), LSD use increased from 9.9% to 16.6% (a 67.7% relative increase, P < .001), powder cocaine use increased from 17.3% to 35.2% (a 103.5% relative increase, P < .001), and GHB use increased from 1.0% to 4.2% (a 311.8% relative increase; P = .002). Past-year use of >3 drugs increased from 12.7% to 20.5% (a 61.4% relative increase; P = .013); however, estimated past-year use of unknown powders decreased from 2.0% to 1.1% (a relative 44.7% decrease; P = .038) and ecstasy/MDMA/Molly use was stable across years (at 25.0 to 28.5 %; P = .687). CONCLUSIONS: Reports of powder cocaine, LSD, ketamine, and GHB are becoming more prevalent among EDM party attendees. Prevention and harm reduction efforts are needed to address increasing use.

Although the NMDA receptor has been shown to impair memory acquisition by disrupting long-term potentiation (LTP), limited research has been done on studying the effects of NMDA antagonists on the post-LTP cascade of events implicated in consolidation as measured by administering the drug after the initial learning experience. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this experiment was to examine the effect of ketamine on mental status and to identify NMDA antagonist-induced memory deficits by comparing the recall performance of items presented both immediately before and during ketamine infusion. METHODS: Thirteen normal controls received a 60-min infusion of ketamine in a randomized double-blind, cross-over design. Mental status was evaluated with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale. The first 12-item word list was presented immediately before infusion, and two lists were subsequently presented during the infusion. Verbal memory performance was assessed by measuring the delayed cued recall of each list 30 min after its presentation. RESULTS: At the beginning, subjects experienced perceptual and reality distortion symptoms, followed later by mild subjective effects. Ketamine significantly reduced the delayed recall of words presented immediately before, but not during, drug infusion. Ketamine-induced decrements in verbal recall correlated significantly with plasma ketamine levels. CONCLUSION: This study characterizes the behavioral effects associated with ketamine and suggests that ketamine decreases verbal memory performance by interfering with early consolidation processes.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.006509978789836168, 0.988191545009613, 0.014334159903228283, 0.004797841422259808]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
7077,"Effects of intravenous ketamine on explicit and implicit measures of suicidality in treatment-resistant depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Intravenous ketamine has shown rapid antidepressant effects in early trials, making it a potentially attractive candidate for depressed patients at imminent risk of suicide. The Implicit Association Test (IAT), a performance-based measure of association between concepts, may have utility in suicide assessment. METHODS: Twenty-six patients with treatment-resistant depression were assessed using the suicidality item of the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-SI) 2 hours before and 24 hours following a single subanesthetic dose of intravenous ketamine. Ten patients also completed IATs assessing implicit suicidal associations at comparable time points. In a second study, nine patients received thrice-weekly ketamine infusions over a 12-day period. RESULTS: Twenty-four hours after a single infusion, MADRS-SI scores were reduced on average by 2.08 points on a 0 to 6 scale (p < .001; d = 1.37), and 81% of patients received a rating of 0 or 1 postinfusion. Implicit suicidal associations were also reduced following ketamine (p = .003; d = 1.36), with reductions correlated across implicit and explicit measures. MADRS-SI reductions were sustained for 12 days by repeated-dose ketamine (p < .001; d = 2.42). CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings support the premise that ketamine has rapid beneficial effects on suicidal cognition and warrants further study.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.006883614230901003, 0.9887441396713257, 0.015049963258206844, 0.004908109083771706]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
7126,"Elevated impulsivity and impaired decision-making cognition in heavy users of MDMA (""Ecstasy"").^\nRationale: In animal studies, the common club drug 3,4- methylendioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""Ecstasy"") consistently caused a prolonged loss of presynaptic serotonergic neurons, and evidence suggests that MDMA consumption may also affect the human serotonergic system. Serotonin (5-HT) has been implicated in the regulation of impulsivity and such executive functions as decision-making cognition. In fact, MDMA users have shown elevated impulsivity in two studies, but little is known about decision making in drug-free MDMA consumers. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the cognitive neurotoxicity of MDMA with regard to behavioral impulsivity and decision-making cognition. Methods: Nineteen male, abstinent, heavy MDMA users; 19 male, abstinent cannabis users; and 19 male, drug-naïve controls were examined with the Matching Familiar Figures Test (MFFT) as well as with a Go/No-Go Task (GNG) for impulsivity and with a Gambling Task (GT) for executive functioning. Results: MDMA users showed significantly elevated impulsivity in the MFFT Impulsivity score (I-score), but not in commission errors of the GNG, compared with controls. Cannabis users did not yield altered impulsivity compared with controls. In the GT, MDMA users performed significantly worse than cannabis consumers and controls, whereas cannabis users exhibited the same decision-making capacity as controls. In addition, the I-score as well as the decision-making performance was correlated with measures of MDMA intake. The I-score and the decision-making performance were also correlated. Conclusions: These results suggest that heavy use of MDMA may elevate behavioral impulsivity and impair decision-making cognition possibly mediated by a selective impairment of the 5-HT system. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0050725615583360195, 0.9853555560112, 0.01828847825527191, 0.0042450265027582645]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
7210,"Change in frequency of acute and subacute effects of ecstasy in a group of novice users after 6 months of regular use.^\nBackground: Recent research trends are to specify the relation between patterns of ecstasy use and side effects, possibility of dependency, tolerance and long term neurocognitive damage. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of regular ecstasy use on its acute and subacute effects. Subjects and methods: At the first stage, we recruited 120 subjects. If participants continued regular use of ecstasy in this period, they were asked to participate in the second stage of the research 6 months later. Thirty-five subjects attended the second stage of the study, 5 of which were excluded because they had less than 5 drug experiences during the last 6 months. At last, we recruited 30 novice ecstasy users by means of the snowball technique in Tehran, Iran. The pattern of use and experienced effects of ecstasy was documented at the beginning and after 6 months of regular consumption with a self administered questionnaire. Results: Little or no change was observed in acute effects. Those subacute effects that had considerable increase in frequency were anxiety, depression, aggression, memory impairment, poor concentration and learning problems. Conclusion: Small change in acute effects suggests low possibility of tolerance after at least 6 months of regular use. Our results support long term neurocognitive damage and mood impairment with ecstasy use.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.00515730818733573, 0.9863870143890381, 0.01725146546959877, 0.004667665343731642]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

Prospective studies for other tryptamines have suggested beneficial effects on mental health outcomes. In preparation for a study in patients with depression, the present study GH001-HV-101 aimed to assess the impact of four different dose levels of a novel vaporized 5-MeO-DMT formulation (GH001) administered via inhalation as single doses of 2 (N = 4), 6 (N = 6), 12 (N = 4) and 18 mg (N = 4), and in an individualized dose escalation regimen (N = 4) on the safety, tolerability, and the dose-related psychoactive effects in healthy volunteers (N = 22). The psychedelic experience was assessed with a novel Peak Experience Scale (PES), the Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ), the Ego Dissolution Inventory (EDI), the Challenging Experience Questionnaire (CEQ), and the 5-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness Questionnaire (5D-ASC). Further aims were to assess the impact of 5-MeO-DMT on cognitive functioning, mood, and well-being. Higher doses of 5-MeO-DMT produced significant increments in the intensity of the psychedelic experience ratings as compared to the lowest 2 mg dose on all questionnaires, except the CEQ. Prominent effects were observed following single doses of 6, 12, and 18 mg on PES and MEQ ratings, while maximal effects on PES, MEQ, EDI, and 5D-ASC ratings were observed following individualized dose escalation of 5-MeO-DMT. Measures of cognition, mood, and well-being were not affected by 5-MeO-DMT. Vital signs at 1 and 3 h after administration were not affected and adverse events were generally mild and resolved spontaneously. Individualized dose escalation of 5-MeO-DMT may be preferable over single dose administration for clinical applications that aim to maximize the experience to elicit a strong therapeutic response.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.005951074883341789, 0.988338828086853, 0.014294075779616833, 0.004797315690666437]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
7537,"Symptomatological features of patients with and without Ecstasy use during their first psychotic episode.^\nBACKGROUND: Ecstasy use is generally chosen by adolescents and young adults for its entactogenic properties (the production of feelings of empathy, love, and emotional closeness to others.) Despite this desired and frequently realized outcome, Ecstasy use has often resulted in the genesis of psychotic symptoms and aggressive behaviors, particularly after chronic and/or intensive use. METHODS: To explore the negative consequences of Ecstasy use and to examine the aggressive nature oftentimes seen in many Ecstasy users we employed a case-control study model. We compared, by means of validated psychometric tests, the psychopathological symptoms (BPRS), the aggressiveness (OAS) and the social adjustment (DSM-GAF) of psychotic patients with (n = 23) and without (n = 46) recent user of Ecstasy, during their first psychotic episode and hospitalization. All 23 Ecstasy users were Ecstasy users only. RESULTS: Almost all of the psychotic symptoms were of similar severity in both groups. Blunted affect was milder in users than in non-users, whereas hostility and aggressive behavior was significantly more severe in users than in non-users. CONCLUSIONS: psychosis with a high level of aggressiveness and violence constitutes an important 'side-effect' that surely runs counter to the expected entactogenic action of Ecstasy. At a patient psycho-educational level, this study suggests that the use of Ecstasy may be counterproductive with respect to user expectations.","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.632462203502655, 0.6369620561599731, 0.02209625020623207, 0.018191220238804817]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
8578,"The external validity of results derived from ecstasy users recruited using purposive sampling strategies.^\nThis study sought to compare the patterns and correlates of 'recent' and 'regular' ecstasy use estimated on the basis of two datasets generated in 2001 in New South Wales, Australia, from a probability and a non-probability sample. The first was the National Drug Strategy Household Survey (NDSHS), a multistage probability sample of the general population; and the second was the Illicit Drug Reporting System (IDRS) Party Drugs Module, for which regular ecstasy users were recruited using purposive sampling strategies. NDSHS recent ecstasy users (any use in the preceding 12 months) were compared on a range of demographic and drug use variables to NDSHS regular ecstasy users (at least monthly use in the preceding 12 months) and purposively sampled regular ecstasy users (at least monthly use in the preceding 6 months). The demographic characteristics of the three samples were consistent. Among all three, the mean age was approximately 25 years, and a majority (60%) of subjects were male, relatively well-educated, and currently employed or studying. Patterns of ecstasy use were similar among the three samples, although compared to recent users, regular users were likely to report more frequent use of ecstasy. All samples were characterised by extensive polydrug use, although the two samples of regular ecstasy users reported higher rates of other illicit drug use than the sample of recent users. The similarities between the demographic and drug use characteristics of the samples are striking, and suggest that, at least in NSW, purposive sampling that seeks to draw from a wide cross-section of users and to sample a relatively large number of individuals, can give rise to samples of ecstasy users that may be considered sufficiently representative to reasonably warrant the drawing of inferences relating to the entire population. These findings may partially offset concerns that purposive samples of ecstasy users are likely to remain a primary source of ecstasy-related information. © 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

8810,"Quitting ecstasy: An investigation of why people stop taking the drug and their subsequent mental health.^\nThe regular use of ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA) has been associated with depressed mood, anxiety and hostility, but it is not known whether such effects persist after people stop using the drug. Furthermore, little is known about what factors might influence the decision to quit using MDMA. The aim of the present study was to examine the reasons why ex-users had stopped using this drug and to assess their current levels of depression, anxiety, anger and aggression. Telephone interviews were conducted with people who used to take MDMA on a regular basis but who no longer used the drug. The participants comprised sixty-six ex-users who used to take MDMA regularly (at least once every 2 months over a period of at least 1 year), but who had not taken MDMA for at least 1 year (average 3 years). Participants were asked about why they had quit MDMA. They also completed questionnaires to assess trait mood. Ex-users could be divided into two groups based on their reason for quitting: (i) those who had quit for mental health reasons and (ii) those who had quit for circumstantial reasons. Approximately half of those in the mental health group scored in the range for clinical depression. In that group, current levels of depression and anxiety correlated significantly with the cumulative amount of MDMA that they had taken several years previously. These findings suggest that some users may either be more vulnerable to the adverse effects of MDMA or have pre-existing mental health problems for which they self-medicate by using ecstasy. The present study shows that some ex-users experience an impairment to mental health that persists for years after they stop using this drug.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0049377623945474625, 0.9858086705207825, 0.01597726158797741, 0.005301879718899727]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

The current study used nationally representative U.S. data to assess overall and age-specific time trends in the prevalence of lifetime and 12-month use of plant-based hallucinogens and dissociative agents. Methods: Participants were respondents aged ≥ 12 years (N = 1,006,051) from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2002–2019. Predictors were continuous years. Outcomes included illicit use of peyote, mescaline, psilocybin, ketamine, salvia, and tryptamine. Sociodemographic variables (gender; age; race/ethnicity; educational level; family income) were modeled as covariates. Trends were estimated overall and by age (12–17, 18–25, 26+). Prevalence differences [PDs] were obtained for each category, along with 95 % confidence intervals [CI]. Results: Increases in lifetime use were observed for psilocybin (2002–2019 PD=+1.61), tryptamine (2006–2014 PD=+0.55; 2015–2019 PD=+0.44), and ketamine (2006–2014 PD=+0.27; 2015–2019 PD=+0.21). Mescaline use decreased (PD = −0.89). While overall lifetime salvia use increased between 2006 and 2014 (PD=+1.81), prevalence did not change between 2015 and 2019. Twelve-month use of tryptamine and ketamine increased between 2006 and 2014 (PD=+0.14; +0.03, respectively). Twelve-month ketamine use also increased from 2015 to 2019 (PD=+0.03). By age, participants aged 12–17 and 18–25 showed decreases in use of most types of hallucinogens, but those age 26+ generally showed increases. Conclusions: While use of plant-based hallucinogens and dissociative agents remains rare, lifetime use of ketamine, tryptamine, and psilocybin is increasing in adults.

9113,"The effects of multitasking on psychological stress reactivity in recreational users of cannabis and MDMA.^\nBACKGROUND: Cannabis and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) use is associated with psychobiological and neurocognitive deficits. Assessments of the latter typically include tests of memory and everyday cognitive functioning. However, to date, little attention has been paid to effects of drug use on psychological stress reactivity. We report three studies examining the effects of recreational use of cannabis and MDMA on mood and psychological responses to multitasking using a cognitively demanding laboratory stressor that provides an analogue for everyday situations involving responses to multiple stimuli. METHODS: The effects of the multitasking framework on mood and perceived workload were assessed in cannabis (N=25), younger (N=18) and older (N=20) MDMA users and compared with non-target drug controls. RESULTS: Compared with respective control groups, cannabis users became less alert and content, and both MDMA groups became less calm following acute stress. Unexpectedly, the stressor increased ratings of calm in cannabis users. Users also scored higher than their controls with respect to ratings of resources needed to complete the multitasking framework. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show, for the first time, that recreational use of cannabis and MDMA, beyond the period of intoxication, can negatively influence psychological responses to a multitasking stressor, and this may have implications for real-life situations which place high demands on cognitive resources.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.005743298679590225, 0.9885315895080566, 0.014417371712625027, 0.004939147736877203]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
9119,"A systematic review of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy for mental health: An evaluation of the current wave of research and suggestions for the future.^\nResearch on psychedelics has seen a recent revival, with many clinical trials focused on their therapeutic potential to treat a range of mental health conditions. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate clinical trials of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy for mental health conditions from the present wave of psychedelic research (1990s to present). A total of 43 studies met criteria and were included. The conditions reviewed were substance use disorders; anxiety and/or depression, often associated with terminal illness; posttraumatic stress disorder; and obsessive–compulsive disorder. Quantitative results indicate that psychedelics can significantly reduce clinical outcomes associated with these mental health conditions. Common themes identified from qualitative reports included increased acceptance and processing of emotions, connectedness to others, forgiveness, self-compassion, insights into the self, peak or mystical experiences, ego dissolution, positive changes in worldview, motivation and commitment to change, changes in the relationship to the substance of abuse for those with substance use disorder, and acceptance of death for those with terminal illness. No serious, long-term adverse events were reported directly attributable to drug ingestion. We discuss the strengths and limitations of the research base, along with suggestions for clinical practice, potential therapeutic mechanisms, and directions for future research. Despite promising results, further work is needed to determine which psychedelic is best suited for diverse mental health conditions, the most appropriate type of psychotherapy to employ, and the psychological and neurobiological mechanisms underlying clinical benefits.

9151,"LSD, afterglow and hangover: Increased episodic memory and verbal fluency, decreased cognitive flexibility.^\nPsychedelics acutely impair cognitive functions, but these impairments decline with growing experiences with psychedelics and microdoses may even exert opposing effects. Given the recent evidence that psychedelics induce neuroplasticity, this explorative study aimed at investigating the potential of psychedelics to sub-acutely change cognition. For this, we applied a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study with 24 healthy volunteers receiving 50 μg lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) or an inactive placebo. Sub-acute changes in cognition were measured 24 h after dosing, including memory (Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure, ROCF; 2D Object-Location Memory Task, OLMT; Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test, RAVLT), verbal fluency (phonological; semantic; switch), design fluency (basic; filter; switch), cognitive flexibility (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, WCST), sustained and switching attention (Trail Making Test, TMT), inhibitory control (Stroop Task) and perceptual reasoning (Block Design Test, BDT). The results show that when compared to placebo and corrected for Body Mass Index (BMI) and abstinence period from psychedelics, LSD sub-acutely improved visuospatial memory (ROCF immediate recall points and percentage, OLMT consolidation percentage) and phonological verbal fluency and impaired cognitive flexibility (WCST: fewer categories achieved; more perseveration, errors and conceptual level responses). In conclusion, the low dose of LSD moderately induced both ""afterglow"" and ""hangover"".

In each survey, a representative national sample of approximately 5500 people aged 15-45 years were asked about their drug use, including ecstasy use, using a Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) system. Response rates of 79% and 80% respectively were achieved. Results: Last-year use of ecstasy increased from 1.5% in 1998, to 3.4% in 2001. Large increases were found among men aged 20-24 (4.3% to 12.5%), and 25-29 (3.2% to 8.8%). In 2001, 43% of users thought ecstasy was easier to obtain and 29% thought the price was lower compared with a year earlier.

9381,"Intraoperative ketamine for reduction in postpartum depressive symptoms after cesarean delivery: A double-blind, randomized clinical trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common mental disease happens in perinatal period. Ketamine as an anesthesia and analgesia drug has been used for a long time. In recent years, ketamine is proved to have an antidepression effect with a single administration. We hypothesized that intraoperative ketamine can reduce postpartum depressive symptoms after cesarean delivery. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study trail, healthy women scheduled for cesarean delivery were randomly assigned to receive intravenous ketamine (0.25 mg/kg diluted to 5 ml with 0.9% saline) or placebo (5 ml of 0.9% saline) within 5 min following clamping of the neonatal umbilical cord. The primary outcome was the degree of postpartum depressive symptoms, which was evaluated by Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS, a threshold of 9/10 was used) at 1 week, 2 weeks, and 1 month after delivery. The secondary outcome was the numerical rating scale (NRS) score of pain at 2 days postpartum. This trail is registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, number ChiCTR1900022464. RESULTS: Between 26 January 2019 and 15 July 2019, 502 subjects were screened and 330 were randomly allocated: 165 (50%) to the ketamine group and 165 (50%) to the placebo group. There were significant differences in the degree of postpartum depressive symptoms between subjects in the ketamine group and the placebo group at 1 week postpartum (13.1% vs. 22.6%, respectively; p = .029). However, no difference was found between subjects in the two groups at 2 weeks (11.8% vs. 16.8%, respectively; p = .209) and 1 month postpartum (10.5% vs. 14.2%, respectively; p = .319). The NRS score of wound pain (3.0 ± 0.9 vs. 4.0 ± 1.0, respectively; p < .001) and uterine contraction pain (3.0 ± 0.9 vs. 4.1 ± 0.9, respectively; p < .001) was lower in the ketamine group at 2 days postpartum compared with placebo group. The prevalence of headache, hallucination, and dizziness was higher in the ketamine group than the placebo group during the operation.
