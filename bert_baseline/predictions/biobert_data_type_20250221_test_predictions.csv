6027,"Emotional Effects of Methylphenidate and MDMA in Healthy Subjects.^\n3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""ecstasy"") is widely used by young people for its euphoric effects. MDMA releases serotonin (5‐HT), dopamine (DA), and norepinephrine (NE). 5‐HT release mainly contributes to the subjective effects of MDMA whereas NE release is involved in the cardiovascular and psychostimulant effects of MDMA. DA is also likely to be involved in the rewarding and reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse. However, the functional role of DA in the subjective effects of MDMA in humans is largely unclear. To determine the role of the DA transporter (DAT) in the response to MDMA in humans the investigators test the effects of the DA and NE transporter blocker methylphenidate on the subjective effects of MDMA. The investigators use a randomized double‐blind placebo‐controlled cross‐over design with four experimental sessions. methylphenidate or placebo will be administered before MDMA or placebo to 16 healthy volunteers. Subjective and cardiovascular responses will be repeatedly assessed throughout the experiments and plasma samples are collected for pharmacokinetics. The primary hypothesis is that methylphenidate will significantly reduce the subjective effects of MDMA.",4,"[0.05496983602643013, 0.03362669050693512, 0.04357533901929855, 0.005694686435163021, 0.8621333837509155]",4
6558,"The effects of a sub-anaesthetic dose of ketamine on human selective attention.^\nTested the hypothesis that a sub-anaesthetic dose of the noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, ketamine, would induce psychophysiological and selective attention anomalies in healthy Ss that are commonly observed in schizophrenic patients. In a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled design, 18 healthy male 20–28 yr olds were challenged with 0.3 mg/kg ketamine. Ss were then tested in a selective attention task in which standard (80%) and deviant tones (20%) of either 1000 or 1100 Hz were evenly presented to the left or right ear. Stimulus duration was 50 ms and the interstimulus intervals were randomized between 1750 and 2150 ms. The S was instructed to push a button as quickly as possible after hearing the deviant tone in a specified ear. Ketamine did not alter selective attention task performance of the Ss, but did reduce processing negativity and the P300 amplitude (both in general and to deviant stimuli in particular), enhanced the N100 amplitude to deviant stimuli, and did not effect mismatch negativity. Ketamine induces some of the attentional deficits in healthy Ss that are observed in schizophrenics, suggesting that reduced glutamatergic activity in the brain may be involved in some of the symptoms of schizophrenia.

1958,"Repeated microdoses of LSD in healthy adults: a placebo-controlled study.^\nBackground: The resurgence of interest in therapeutic use of psychedelic drugs has raised interest in microdosing of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). There are numerous media reports that doses of LSD about 1/10th of typical tripping doses, taken at 3‐4‐ day intervals, improve mood and cognition. However, these effects have been difficult to demonstrate under placebocontrolled conditions. Methods: We conducted a double‐blind controlled study examining effects of repeated doses of LSD (13 or 26 μg) or placebo, in healthy adults. Participants were randomly assigned to receive placebo (N = 18), 13 μg LSD (N = 19), or 26 μg LSD(N = 19) during four 5‐hour laboratory sessions, separated by 3‐4 days. They also attended by a drug‐free followup session 3‐4 days after their last session. We assessed mood and subjective states, cognitive and emotional function, and cardiovascular function during the drug sessions and at followup. Results: LSD produced small increases in ratings of 'feeling a drug effect', including both stimulant‐like and LSD‐like effects, especially during the first administration of the drug. The drug produced few effects on emotion or psychomotor tasks or measures of heart rate or pressure, and no residual effects were detected on the drug‐free followup session. Conclusions: We conclude that repeated low doses of LSD are safe and that the repeated dosing design is feasible for future studies, but under these conditions the drug produces negligible changes in mood or cognition. Future studies are needed with larger sample sizes, longer duration of dosing, additional measures of cognitive or affective function, and with participants who exhibit clinical symptoms of anxiety and depression.",2,"[0.0008236264111474156, 0.015711430460214615, 0.97510826587677, 0.0041190884076058865, 0.004237630404531956]",2
1765,"Nicotine fails to attenuate ketamine-induced cognitive deficits and negative and positive symptoms in humans: implications for schizophrenia.^\nBACKGROUND: The uncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, ketamine, induces a range of symptoms resembling those seen in schizophrenia. Enhancement of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) function may have potential as a treatment for the cognitive deficits and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Accordingly, we examined the modulatory effects of brain nAChR systems on NMDAR antagonist-induced effects. METHODS: The interactive effects of ketamine and nicotine were evaluated in 37 healthy subjects in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover counterbalanced, 2 (intravenous ketamine or placebo) × 2 (intravenous nicotine or placebo) design. Verbal and visual memory, sustained attention, working memory, response inhibition, emotion recognition, executive function, reaction time, motor function, and speed of processing were assessed once per test day, while negative and positive symptoms, perceptual alterations, and a number of feeling states were measured several times before and after administration of drugs. RESULTS: Ketamine induced cognitive deficits and negative and positive symptoms. Nicotine worsened immediate recall, auditory working memory, response inhibition, and executive function and serial processing. Nicotine decreased (improved) reaction time on the sustained attention and choice reaction time tasks. Nicotine did not reduce ketamine-induced cognitive deficits or negative and positive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: At blood levels comparable with tobacco smoking, nicotine infusion does not appear to alleviate the ketamine-induced transient cognitive and behavioral effects in healthy subjects that resemble those seen in schizophrenia. The lack of an effect of nicotine on a spectrum of ketamine effects suggests that the consequences of NMDAR antagonism are not likely under the direct influence of nAChR.",4,"[0.19040179252624512, 0.008721413090825081, 0.022329991683363914, 0.004242094699293375, 0.7743046879768372]",4
305,"Administration of Sub-anesthetic Dose of Ketamine and Electroconvulsive Treatment on Alternate Week Days in Patients with Treatment Resistant Depression: A Double Blind Placebo Controlled Trial.^\nINTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND: Patients with depression who fail to respond to at least two antidepressants in their current episode are considered to have Treatment Resistant Depression (TRD). ECT is an effective treatment of TRD but cognitive side effects limit its use. Ketamine elicits a rapid antidepressant response in sub-anesthetic repeated doses. ECT and ketamine may be modulating the glutamate system, therefore when administered in an interleaved fashion, they could have a synergistic effect. METHODS: 15 TRD patients were recruited and 12 were included in the analysis. Patients were randomly assigned to an ECT + iv. ketamine or ECT + iv. placebo (midazolam). At baseline and before each infusion, depression severity scales were administered. At baseline, halfway through and at the end of the study, cognitive tests were administered. RESULTS: There was no difference between the ketamine and placebo arms, per change in 17-item Hamilton Depression Scores (HAM-D), Young Mania Rating Scores or cognitive tests. Per HAMD scores, 3 ECT +ketamine subjects (42%) showed early remission (HAMD < 8) and maintained euthymia for 3 additional visits. None of the ECT +midazolam subjects (0%) achieved early remission. This difference showed a trend level significance (Chi square P-Value = 0.0910). CONCLUSION: The results of the study were limited due to the small sample size. However, a trend level difference in rates of early remission was seen, suggesting that ketamine + ECT may lead to a faster symptom relief.

5794,"Neural correlates of the severity of cocaine, heroin, alcohol, MDMA and cannabis use in polysubstance abusers: A resting-PET brain metabolism study.^\nIntroduction: Functional imaging studies of addiction following protracted abstinence have not been systematically conducted to look at the associations between severity of use of different drugs and brain dysfunction. Findings from such studies may be relevant to implement specific interventions for treatment. The aim of this study was to examine the association between resting-state regional brain metabolism (measured with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) and the severity of use of cocaine, heroin, alcohol, MDMA and cannabis in a sample of polysubstance users with prolonged abstinence from all drugs used. Methods: Our sample consisted of 49 polysubstance users enrolled in residential treatment. We conducted correlation analyses between estimates of use of cocaine, heroin, alcohol, MDMA and cannabis and brain metabolism (BM) (using Statistical Parametric Mapping voxel-based (VB) whole-brain analyses). In all correlation analyses conducted for each of the drugs we controlled for the co-abuse of the other drugs used. Results: The analysis showed significant negative correlations between severity of heroin, alcohol, MDMA and cannabis use and BM in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and temporal cortex. Alcohol use was further associated with lower metabolism in frontal premotor cortex and putamen, and stimulants use with parietal cortex. Conclusions: Duration of use of different drugs negatively correlated with overlapping regions in the DLPFC, whereas severity of cocaine, heroin and alcohol use selectively impact parietal, temporal, and frontal-premotor/basal ganglia regions respectively. The knowledge of these associations could be useful in the clinical practice since different brain alterations have been associated with different patterns of execution that may affect the rehabilitation of these patients. © 2012 Moreno-López et al.",4,"[0.47462916374206543, 0.013182133436203003, 0.004878676496446133, 0.008766170591115952, 0.4985438883304596]",0

8767,"Structural connectivity and response to ketamine therapy in major depression: A preliminary study.^\nBackground: Ketamine elicits an acute antidepressant effect in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Here, we used diffusion imaging to explore whether regional differences in white matter microstructure prior to treatment may predict clinical response 24 h following ketamine infusion in 10 MDD patients. Methods: FSL's Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) established voxel-level differences in fractional anisotropy (FA) between responders (patients showing > 50% improvement in symptoms 24 h post-infusion) and non-responders in major white matter pathways. Follow-up regions-of-interest (ROI) analyses examined differences in FA and radial (RD), axial (AD) and mean diffusivity (MD) between responders and non-responders and 15 age- and sex-matched controls, with groups compared pairwise. Results: Whole brain TBSS (p < 0.05, corrected) and confirmatory tract-based regions-of-interest analyses showed larger FA values in the cingulum and forceps minor in responders compared to non-responders; complementary decreases in RD occurred in the cingulum (p < 0.05). Only non-responders differed from controls showing decreased FA in the forceps minor, increased RD in the cingulum and forceps minor, and increased MD in the forceps minor (p < 0.05). Limitations: Non-responders showed an earlier age of onset and longer current depressive episode than responders. Though these factors did not interact with diffusion metrics, results may be impacted by the limited sample size. Conclusions: Though findings are considered preliminary, significant differences in FA, RD and MD shown in non-responders compared to responders and controls in fronto-limbic and ventral striatal pathways suggest that the structural architecture of specific functional networks mediating emotion may predict ketamine response in MDD.

8117,"Apparent transient effects of recent ""ecstasy"" use on cognitive performance and extrapyramidal signs in human subjects.^\nOBJECTIVES: Our purpose is to investigate cognitive performance and extrapyramidal function early after ecstasy use. BACKGROUND: Ecstasy, containing 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine, has shown evidence of causing cognitive deficits and parkinsonian signs. Previous research has examined cognitive performance after a period of prolonged abstinence, but research assessing the early effects of ecstasy after recent use is limited despite temporal neurochemical differences demonstrated in nonhuman models. METHODS: This study compared task performance between 13 ecstasy users (10 to 15 h postdrug use) and a control group on a battery of neuropsychologic assessments while matching for education level, sleep deprivation, and premorbid IQ. The groups were also compared on measures relating to parkinsonian signs. RESULTS: The ecstasy subjects showed impairments on measures of executive function as evaluated by Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices (SPM) and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST). Short-delay free recall memory was also impaired in ecstasy subjects on the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-II). No extrapyramidal motor impairments were detected. CONCLUSIONS: These deficits resemble deficits previously reported in chronic ecstasy use but also seem to reveal transient impairments in executive function.

3820,"Effect of baseline anxious depression on initial and sustained antidepressant response to ketamine.^\nOBJECTIVE: Patients with anxious depression are typically more difficult to treat with monoaminergic antidepressants compared to those with nonanxious depression. Although novel research has shown that the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine has rapidly acting, relatively sustained effects in treating depression, we predicted that, consistent with the existent literature on traditional antidepressants, patients with anxious depression would have a poorer antidepressant response. METHOD: Twenty-six inpatients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD) (DSM-IV criteria) received a single infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes) from January 2006-March 2013 and were followed for 28 days. A post hoc analysis compared treatment response and relapse using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) in patients with anxious versus nonanxious depression. Anxious depression was defined as MDD plus a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale anxiety/somatization factor score ≥ 7. RESULTS: Both anxious and nonanxious depressed patients responded positively to ketamine. A linear mixed model controlling for baseline with the MADRS revealed a significant group main effect (P = .03) and group-by-time interaction (P = .01). Post hoc tests indicated that patients with anxious depression had significantly fewer depression symptoms compared to those with nonanxious depression at days 1 through 5, 9 through 12, 15 through 17, and 25, with no significant group differences in dissociative (P = .62) or psychotic (P = .41) side effects. Regarding responders, patients with anxious depression relapsed significantly later than those with nonanxious depression (median ± SE = 19.0 ± 17.9 vs 1.0 ± 0.0 days to relapse, respectively; χ² = 9.30; P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: Unexpectedly, patients with anxious depression responded better to ketamine than those with nonanxious depression, with longer time to relapse and no side effect differences. This finding gives promise for the role of novel glutamatergic medications for the treatment of those with anxious depression, a traditionally difficult-to-treat subgroup of depressed patients.

In the first randomized controlled trial of ketamine to use a psychoactive control condition, we tested ketamine's acute effects on explicit suicidal cognition as well as on a performancebased index of implicit suicidal cognition (the Implicit Association Test; IAT) previously linked to suicidal behavior. Methods: Symptomatic patients with treatment‐resistant depression, defined as inadequate response to ≥ 3 antidepressants, were assessed using a composite index of explicit suicidal ideation (Beck Suicide Scale, Montgomery‐Asberg Rating Scale suicide item, Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms‐Self Report suicide item) and the IAT to assess implicit suicidal associations. Measures were taken at baseline and 24‐hours following a single subanesthetic dose of IV ketamine (n=37) or a psychoactive control with no known antidepressant properties (midazolam; n=21). Results: 24‐hours post‐infusion, explicit suicidal cognition was significantly reduced in the ketamine but not the midazolam group (group x time: p=.01). 51% of ketamine‐treated patients scored zero on all three explicit suicide measures at 24‐hours, compared with 24% of the midazolam group (Pearson's chi‐square p=.04). Implicit associations between self‐ and escape‐related words were also reduced following ketamine (p=.002; d=.51) but not midazolam (p=.65; d=.13). Conclusions: Intravenous ketamine produces rapid reductions in suicidal cognition over and above active placebo.

Oral fluid is an important alternative matrix for drug testing, but little is known about MDMA detection windows in oral fluid. AIMS: The aim was to characterize MDMA and metabolite disposition in expectorated oral fluid after controlled MDMA administration. METHODS: Placebo, low (1.0 mg/kg), and high (1.6 mg/kg) oral MDMA doses were given double-blind in random order in separate sessions to 29 healthy adults with histories of MDMA use. One thousand two hundred eighty-six expectorated oral fluid specimens collected up to 7 days after dosing were analyzed for MDMA, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine (HMMA), and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine (HMA) by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The limits of quantification were 5 ng/mL for MDMA and MDA and 10 ng/mL for HMA and HMMA. RESULTS: MDMA was the primary analyte detected, with concentrations up to 12,000 ng/mL in 872 specimens (67.8%). MDA was quantified in 656 specimens (51.0%) at concentrations <403 ng/mL and was never present without concurrent MDMA. HMA and HMMA were not detected. Of the specimens, 59.8%, 58.6%, and 54.9% were found to be MDMA positive at the Talloires (20 ng/mL), Driving under the Influence of Drugs, Alcohol, and Medicines (25 ng/mL) and proposed US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (50 ng/mL) confirmation cutoffs, respectively. MDMA was first observed in oral fluid 0.25-1.25 hours after dosing; MDA was initially detected at 0.5-1.75 hours. In general, the windows of detection for MDMA and MDA were 47 and 29 hours, respectively, although a few specimens were positive up to 71 and 47 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Oral fluid monitoring efficiently detects single, recreational 70-150 mg of MDMA use for 1-2 days. These controlled administration data provide a scientific basis for interpreting MDMA oral fluid test results.",2,"[0.005360277369618416, 0.003985980991274118, 0.9793471693992615, 0.002503893105313182, 0.00880278367549181]",2
5697,"3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy for post-traumatic stress disorder in military veterans, firefighters, and police officers: a randomised, double-blind, dose-response, phase 2 clinical trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is prevalent in military personnel and first responders, many of whom do not respond to currently available treatments. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy for treating chronic PTSD in this population. METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, dose-response, phase 2 trial at an outpatient psychiatric clinic in the USA. We included service personnel who were 18 years or older, with chronic PTSD duration of 6 months or more, and who had a Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-IV) total score of 50 or greater. Using a web-based randomisation system, we randomly assigned participants (1:1:2) to three different dose groups of MDMA plus psychotherapy: 30 mg (active control), 75 mg, or 125 mg. We masked investigators, independent outcome raters, and participants until after the primary endpoint. MDMA was administered orally in two 8-h sessions with concomitant manualised psychotherapy. The primary outcome was mean change in CAPS-IV total score from baseline to 1 month after the second experimental session. Participants in the 30 mg and 75 mg groups subsequently underwent three 100-125 mg MDMA-assisted psychotherapy sessions in an open-label crossover, and all participants were assessed 12 months after the last MDMA session. Safety was monitored through adverse events, spontaneously reported expected reactions, vital signs, and suicidal ideation and behaviour. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01211405. FINDINGS: Between Nov 10, 2010, and Jan 29, 2015, 26 veterans and first responders met eligibility criteria and were randomly assigned to receive 30 mg (n=7), 75 mg (n=7), or 125 mg (n=12) of MDMA plus psychotherapy. At the primary endpoint, the 75 mg and 125 mg groups had significantly greater decreases in PTSD symptom severity (mean change CAPS-IV total scores of -58·3 [SD 9·8] and -44·3 [28·7]; p=0·001) than the 30 mg group (-11·4 [12·7]). Compared with the 30 mg group, Cohen's d effect sizes were large: 2·8 (95% CI 1·19-4·39) for the 75 mg group and 1·1 (0·04-2·08) for the 125 mg group. In the open-label crossover with full-dose MDMA (100-125 mg), PTSD symptom severity significantly decreased in the group that had previously received 30 mg (p=0·01), whereas no further significant decreases were observed in the group that previously achieved a large response after 75 mg doses in the blinded segment (p=0·81). PTSD symptoms were significantly reduced at the 12-month follow-up compared with baseline after all groups had full-dose MDMA (mean CAPS-IV total score of 38·8 [SD 28·1] vs 87·1 [16·1]; p<0·0001). 85 adverse events were reported by 20 participants. Of these adverse events, four (5%) were serious: three were deemed unrelated and one possibly related to study drug treatment. INTERPRETATION: Active doses (75 mg and 125 mg) of MDMA with adjunctive psychotherapy in a controlled setting were effective and well tolerated in reducing PTSD symptoms in veterans and first responders.

6541,"The Kappa Opioid Receptor and the Sleep of Reason: Cortico-Subcortical Imbalance Following Salvinorin-A.^\nBACKGROUND: The mechanisms through which kappa opioid receptor (KOR) agonists induce psychotomimetic effects are largely unknown, although the modulation of this receptor has attracted attention for its clinical use. In this work, we characterize the neuropharmacological effects of salvinorin-A, a highly selective KOR agonist. METHODS: Changes in multimodal electroencephalography, single-photon emission computed tomography, and subjective effects following the acute administration of salvinorin-A are reported. The study included 2 sub-studies that employed a double-blind, crossover, randomized, placebo-controlled design. RESULTS: The electroencephalography measures showed a marked increase in delta and gamma waves and a decrease in alpha waves while subjects were under the effect of salvinorin-A. Regarding single-photon emission computed tomography measures, significant decreases in regional cerebral blood flow were detected in multiple regions of the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital cortices. Significant regional cerebral blood flow increases were observed in some regions of the medial temporal lobe, including the amygdala, the hippocampal gyrus, and the cerebellum. The pattern of subjective effects induced by salvinorin-A was similar to those observed in relation to other psychotomimetic drugs but with an evidently dissociative nature. No dysphoric effects were reported. CONCLUSION: The salvinorin-A-mediated KOR agonism induced dramatic psychotomimetic effects along with a generalized decrease in cerebral blood flow and electric activity within the cerebral cortex.",4,"[0.2989586889743805, 0.005190980155020952, 0.007471665274351835, 0.00648918654769659, 0.6818894147872925]",4
6146,"IM Ketamine vs Midazolam for Suicidal ER Patients.^\nRising US suicide rates and the increased risk of suicide among persons who visit an emergency department (ED) for suicidality make the ED an important site for interventions to prevent suicide. Clinical trials, including ours, show relief of suicidal thoughts within hours of treatment with inexpensive, generic, subanesthetic ketamine. We have received NIMH R01 funding to conduct a clinical trial of intramuscular (IM) ketamine in unipolar or bipolar depressed adults who present to the CUIMC psychiatric ED with suicidality severe enough to require inpatient hospitalization as judged by ED clinical staff. Clinical staff will ask potentially eligible patients if they would like to learn more about the study, and if so, a research assistant (RA) will describe the study to the patient and perform a basic eligibility screen. Key exclusions are unstable medical problems, substance abuse, psychosis, and further detail is provided in the Inclusion/Exclusion criteria. Participants (N=90) who enroll will undergo baseline clinical ratings, brief cognitive testing, and then be randomized, double‐blind, in a 2:1 ratio to a single IM injection of ketamine (n=60) or midazolam comparator (n=30). Vital signs and clinical state will be monitored until injection effects subside (approximately 2 hrs). Blood samples will be drawn at 60 minutes and 90 minutes postinjection to assay ketamine level and a genetic sample will be stored. All participants will then be admitted to the 9GN inpatient unit for standard clinical treatment with periodic research follow‐up ratings through 4 weeks post‐discharge from hospital.

1650,"Efficacy and safety of adjunctive therapy using esketamine or racemic ketamine for adult treatment-resistant depression: A randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority study.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine and its enantiomers have recently been highlighted as one of the most effective therapeutic options in refractory depression. However, racemic ketamine and esketamine have not been directly compared. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of esketamine compared to ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). METHODS: This is a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, bicentre, non-inferiority clinical trial, with two parallel groups. Participants were randomly assigned to a 40-min single intravenous infusion of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg or esketamine 0.25 mg/kg. The primary outcome was the difference in remission rates for depression 24 h following intervention using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), with a non-inferiority margin of 20%. RESULTS: 63 subjects were included and randomly assigned (29 to receive ketamine and 34 to receive esketamine). At 24 h, 24.1% of participants in the ketamine group and 29.4% of participants in the esketamine group showed remission, with a difference of 5.3% (95% CILB -13.6%), confirming non-inferiority. MADRS scores improved from 33 (SD 9.3) to 16.2 (SD 10.7) in the ketamine group and from 33 (SD 5.3) to 17.5 (SD 12.2) in the esketamine one, with a difference of -5.27% (95% CILB, -13.6).

3769,"Motives and Side-Effects of Microdosing With Psychedelics Among Users.^\nBACKGROUND: Microdosing with psychedelics has gained considerable media attention where it is portrayed as a performance enhancer, especially popular on the work floor. While reports are in general positive, scientific evidence about potential negative effects is lacking aside from the prevalence and motives for use. The present study addressed this gap by surveying psychedelic users about their experience with microdosing including their dosing schedule, motivation, and potential experienced negative effects. METHODS: An online questionnaire was launched on several websites and fora between March and July 2018. Respondents who had consented, were 18 years of age or older, and had experience with microdosing were included in the analyses. RESULTS: In total, 1116 of the respondents were either currently microdosing (79.5%) or microdosed in the past (20.5%). Lysergic acid diethylamide (10 mcg) and psilocybin (0.5 g) were the most commonly used psychedelics with a microdosing frequency between 2 and 4 times per week. The majority of users, however, were oblivious about the consumed dose. Performance enhancement was the main motive to microdose (37%). The most reported negative effects were of psychological nature and occurred acutely while under the influence. CONCLUSION: In line with media reports and anecdotes, the majority of our respondents microdosed to enhance performance. Negative effects occurred mostly acutely after substance consumption. However, the main reason to have stopped microdosing was that it was not effective. Future experimental placebo-controlled studies are needed to test whether performance enhancement can be quantified and to assess potential negative effects after longer term microdosing.",0,"[0.9312142729759216, 0.005597119685262442, 0.0030629304237663746, 0.01275730598717928, 0.04736834764480591]",0
221,"Effects of ketamine anesthesia on efficacy, tolerability, seizure response, and neurocognitive outcomes in electroconvulsive therapy: A comprehensive meta-analysis of double-blind randomized controlled trials.^\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) remains the most effective treatment for major depressive disorder. Ketamine is an anesthetic gaining attention for its rapid antidepressant effect. Numerous randomized controlled trials have investigated the effect of ketamine anesthesia in ECT on various clinical outcomes. Previous systematic reviews have not found benefit for overall depression response, although some have found evidence of benefit early in the ECT course. Clear quantitative conclusions have not been established regarding other outcomes, particularly while only using data from high-quality studies. We aimed to examine all data from double-blind randomized controlled trials comparing ketamine to other anesthetics via meta-analysis, to make recommendations regarding ECT practice and future research. Data were extracted for depressive symptoms, seizure duration and electrical dose, neuropsychological performance, and adverse effects. Effect sizes were calculated using Hedge's g and odds ratios. Eighteen studies (n = 915) were included in the meta-analysis. Ketamine was not found to enhance improvement of depressive symptoms, either early in ECT course or at end of study. Ketamine had a large effect on increasing seizure duration both overall (Hedge's g = 0.71, P = 0.038) and in the subgroup receiving ketamine in combination with another anesthetic (Hedge's g = 0.78, P < 0.01), and on decreasing electrical dose (Hedge's g = 1.98, P = 0.039). There was no significant effect of ketamine on any individual neuropsychological domain. Ketamine was not associated with increased adverse effects, except for hypertension in patients receiving ketamine monotherapy. Significant heterogeneity was present for many outcomes, and sensitivity analyses suggested a relation to methodological variation in most cases. This study supports the finding that ketamine does not enhance ECT's antidepressant effect, including on early improvement, but provides substantial evidence for enhancing seizure duration and reducing electrical dose. No significant benefit was found on neurocognitive outcomes, but analysis was limited by small sample sizes and high heterogeneity. Ketamine is generally safe in ECT, particularly as a coanesthetic. Our findings provide meta-analytic support to the recommendations in ECT clinical guidelines for use of coadjuvant ketamine in ECT where seizures are suboptimal. Further studies targeting neurocognitive outcomes are encouraged.

Within the next few years MDMA-assisted therapy is projected for approval by regulatory authorities. MDMA's primary mechanism of action includes modulation of monoamine signaling by increasing release and inhibiting reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and, to a lesser extent, dopamine. This pharmacology affects sympathomimetic physiology. In controlled trials, special attention has been given to cardiovascular adverse events (AEs), because transient increases in heart rate and blood pressure have been observed during the MDMA-assisted therapy sessions. Finding and quantifying the potential drivers of cardiac AEs in clinical trials is difficult since only a relatively small number of participants have been included in these studies, and a limited set of allowed concomitant drugs has been studied. In this study a more diverse set of reports from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System was surveyed. We found 17 cases of cardiovascular AEs, in which the individuals had taken one or more substances in addition to MDMA.

METHODS: A systematic search in electronic databases (i.e., PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Web of Science) performed in January and February 2021 identified English articles published between 1990 and 2020 reporting the effects of psilocybin on mental health measures. Data from included articles were retrieved and organized according to the RDoC bio-behavioral matrix and its constituent six main domains, namely: positive valence systems, negative valence systems, cognitive systems, social processes, sensorimotor systems, and arousal and regulatory systems. RESULTS: The preponderance of research with psilocybin has differentially reported beneficial effects on positive valence systems, negative valence system, and social process domains. The data from the included studies support both short-term (23 assessments) and long-term (15 assessments) beneficial effects of psilocybin on the positive valence systems. While 12 of the extracted outcome measures suggest that psilocybin use is associated with increases in the ""fear"" construct of the negative valence systems domain, 19 findings show no significant effects on this construct, and seven parameters show lowered levels of the ""sustained threat"" construct in the long term. Thirty-four outcome measures revealed short-term alterations in the social systems' construct namely, ""perception and understanding of self,"" and ""social communications"" as well as enhancements in ""perception and understanding of others"" and ""affiliation and attachment"". The majority of findings related to the cognitive systems' domain reported dyscognitive effects. There have been relatively few studies reporting outcomes of psilocybin on the remaining RDoC domains. Moreover, seven of the included studies suggest the transdiagnostic effects of psilocybin. The dashboard characterization of RDoC outcomes with psilocybin suggests beneficial effects in the measures of reward, threat, and arousal, as well as general social systems. CONCLUSIONS: Psilocybin possesses a multi-domain effectiveness. The field would benefit from highly rigorous proof-of-mechanism research to assess the effects of psilocybin using the RDoC framework. The combined effect of psilocybin with psychosocial interventions with RDoC-based outcomes is a priority therapeutic vista.",3,"[0.0068258969113230705, 0.004119146149605513, 0.0041514053009450436, 0.9809532761573792, 0.003950352780520916]",3
2800,"Visits to the emergency department due to ecstasy (MDMA) and amphetamine derivative consumption: Epidemiological, clinical and evolutional profile.^\nObjectives: To describe clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of emergency department visits related with ecstasy usage, determine the rate of re-visits of the patients and their related factors. Material and methods: The clinical histories of the patients coming to the Emergency Department for ecstasy-related problems were reviewed during 89 consecutive months in order to define the epidemiological and clinical profile. The computerized system of admission was used to study re-visits to the emergency department, reviewing the clinical history of the re-visits to see if they were related with drug consumption. Results: The study included 498 cases (71% male, mean age 26.5 years). The majority of the patients were attended on the weekend (66.6%) and at night (57%). Main complaints were anxiety or altered thoughts (32.8%), agitation (17.2%), impaired awareness level (7.2%) and convulsions or abnormal movements (5.6%). A total of 81% of the patients had consumed other substances besides ecstasy, mainly ethanol (53%), cocaine (36%) and gammahydroxibutirate (liquid ecstasy, 25%). Twenty six patients (5%) required admission to hospital (6 in the intensive care unit) and 4 died (0.8%). Fifteen percent of the patients were re-attended in the same ED for drug-related problems after a mean follow-up of 3 years, the new visit being more frequent during the first months. The need for an urgent psychiatric visit (OR: 6.3; 95% CI: 2.912.8) and hospital admission (OR: 3.5; 95% CI: 1.58.4) during their first ED attendance were independently associated with a greater risk of re-attendance. Conclusions: Ecstasy consumption frequently leads to an ED visit, sometimes due to severe medical complications, and at least 15% of patients will need urgent care again for drug-related problems within the next 3 years. This likelihood increases along with increased severity of the index episode (need of psychiatric consultation or hospital admission). © 2009 ElsevierEspaña, S.L.Todoslosderechosreservados.",1,"[0.21445779502391815, 0.5282064080238342, 0.0712655782699585, 0.025560718029737473, 0.16050951182842255]",0

4356,"MDMA: a social drug in a social context.^\nRATIONALE: The drug ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""ecstasy,"" ""molly"") is thought to produce prosocial effects and enhance social interaction. However, in most laboratory studies to date, the participants have been tested under nonsocial conditions, which may not simulate the effects the drug produces in more naturalistic social settings. METHODS: Healthy experienced MDMA users participated in three laboratory sessions in which they received MDMA (0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg or placebo, double blind). They were randomly assigned to one of three social conditions, in which they were tested alone (solitary (SOL); N = 10), in the presence of a research assistant (research assistant present (RAP); N = 11) or in the presence of another participant who also received the drug (other participant present (OPP); N = 11). RESULTS: As expected, MDMA increased heart rate and blood pressure and produced positive subjective effects in all the three groups. It also increased ratings of attractiveness of another person and increased social interaction in RAP and OPP. The social context affected certain responses to the drug. The effects of MDMA were greater in the OPP condition, compared to the SOL or RAP conditions, on measures of ""feel drug,"" ""dizzy,"" and on cardiovascular. But responses to the drug on other measures, including social behavior, did not differ across the conditions. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide some support for the idea that drugs produce greater effects when they are used in the presence of other drug users. However, the influence of the social context was modest, and it remains to be determined whether other variables related to social context would substantially alter the effects of MDMA or other drugs.",4,"[0.09954395145177841, 0.013075053691864014, 0.0128850182518363, 0.004930912517011166, 0.8695650696754456]",4
892,"Rejection and acceptance of LSD: Users and controls compared.^\nIn reviewing the natural history of LSD use, one is impressed with the rapid expansion of the size of the group which has taken the drug. Many individuals seem to be ready to have that sort of drug experience and, afterward, some become enthusiastic proselytizers. But their efforts to persuade others to take the drug do not always succeed; there are many individuals who are unwilling to try LSD. One is immediately curious. In what ways do those who resist taking LSD differ from those who are willing to take it? It is possible that these differences, if they can be isolated as variables, might be found to play an important role in impeding or facilitating the diffusion of other mind-altering drugs, alcohol or marijuana, for example. In the meantime, if one can set forth the variables which influence the acceptance or rejection of LSD, one has added to the understanding of the natural history of its use. We expected that resistance to LSD, defined as the refusal to take the drag when it was offered or a failure to pursue an opportunity to take the drug in circumstances where it was available, would depend upon four general sets of factors: the kind of information the person had about LSD effects in relationship to the kind of life experiences he was interested in having; the relationship of the potential receiver of LSD to the one offering it, including the evaluation of the latter by the former in terms of dominance, obligation, trustworthiness, and admiration; the life circumstances of the potential receiver in terms of general life satisfaction and distress; and the personality of the potential receiver, with special reference to ego control, flexibility, feelings of trust, and invulnerability. Interviews, observations, questionnaires, and participant interaction are productive research tools but do not provide a rigid experimental test of hypotheses. However, the hypotheses advanced have been of a rather general nature, and we think the method of inquiry fits the questions. The data do support a finding of consistent differences between persons who accept and reject LSD. Furthermore, drag-accepting behavior does appear to vary in the predicted direction with the kind of information a person possesses, with his or her relationship to the potential initiator in terms of power and status, with the personality of the person with reference to anxiety, ego control, and trust-distrust, and with the life circumstances of the person. More than these, a variety of other differences emerged which should be of considerable interest. Before reporting the findings, it is well to spend a moment on the control group employed. Its selection involved the same problems found in trying to obtain an LSD-using sample. We looked where we could to find people who had had the chance to take LSD and who had refused it. The best source of information was from LSD users themselves; they spoke of those who had rejected the drag. We inquired among persons already interviewed and among our acquaintances for leads to control subjects. In the end, we obtained a sample of forty-seven controls. We cannot contend that they are representative of all controls; we have no way of knowing how many people have had LSD offered to them, nor have we any way of knowing the characteristics of that population.

6228,"LSD Treatment for Persons With Alcohol Use Disorder.^\nAlcohol use causes more overall harm than any other drug and is the seventh leading risk factor for both deaths and disability‐adjusted life years. Alcohol use disorders (AUD) are among the most common and undertreated mental disorders in developed countries. Pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments only show limited efficacy and around 60% of the patients relapse in short‐term after withdrawal. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) was extensively investigated in the 1950s and 1960s and became one of the best‐studied psychoactive substances with several thousands of early scientific reports. Specifically, the use of LSD in the treatment of AUD was investigated extensively. A pooled analysis of six historical clinical trials demonstrated, that a single dose of LSD significantly reduced alcohol use at three and six months after LSD administration and the improvements surpassed treatment with established psychopharmacological interventions. However, these historical studies do not meet today's methodological standards which limits the validity of these findings. Well‐designed studies are needed to further investigate this promising treatment approach. Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate safety and efficacy of LSD for the treatment of AUD. The trial has a double‐blind, active placebo‐controlled, randomized, parallel design and will be conducted in three specialized treatment centers for addictive disorders in Switzerland. The study will include 128 patients after withdrawal treatment and will primarily assess the efficacy of LSD for relapse prevention after standard detoxification. Patients will be treated using a 1:1 allocation. In the first session, patients in the treatment group will receive a dose of 150 µg LSD, followed by another 150 µg or 250 µg LSD in the second session, which will take place approximately 4 weeks after the first session. The primary outcome is the mean of percent heavy drinking days after administration of two doses of LSD at 3 months' follow‐up. Additionally, other alcohol associated parameters and associated common comorbidities as well as potential predictors and mediators for treatment response will be assessed.",1,"[0.005338340997695923, 0.8921506404876709, 0.06463343650102615, 0.009288583882153034, 0.028588853776454926]",1
2556,"Low-dose ketamine for treatment resistant depression in an academic clinical practice setting.^\nBACKGROUND: Recent studies demonstrating a rapid, robust improvement in treatment resistant depression (TRD) following a single sub-anesthetic infusion of ketamine have generated much excitement. However, these studies are limited in their generalizability to the broader TRD population due to their subject exclusion criteria which typically limit psychiatric comorbidity, concurrent medication, and level of suicide risk. This paper describes the safety and efficacy of sub-anesthetic ketamine infusions in a naturalistic TRD patient sample participating in a real-world TRD treatment program within a major university health system. METHODS: The effects of a sub-anesthetic dose (0.5mg/kg) of ketamine infused IV over forty minutes on TRD patients participating in a treatment program at the University of California, San Diego was investigated by retrospectively analyzing the medical charts of 41 adult TRD patients with a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or Bipolar Disorder (BD). RESULTS: Subjects were aged 48.6, 78% white, 36.6% female, and 82.9% had MDD. Significant psychiatric comorbidity existed in 73%. Average pre-infusion BDI score was 32.6 ± 8.4 (S.D) and dropped to 16.8 ± 3.1 at 24-h post-infusion (p < 0.001). The 24-h response (≥ 50% reduction from pre-infusion) and remission (BDI <13) rates were 53.7% and 41.5%, respectively. Three quarters of responders maintained responder status at 7-days. Ketamine infusions were well tolerated with occasional nausea or anxiety and mild hemodynamic effects during the infusion. LIMITATIONS: Retrospective nature of this study, lack of control group and use of self-report depression ratings scales.

1649,"Comparative study of esketamine and racemic ketamine in treatment-resistant depression: Protocol for a non-inferiority clinical trial.^\nINTRODUCTION: The use of ketamine as an option in the treatment of depressive disorder is growing rapidly, supported by numerous clinical trials attesting its efficacy and safety. Esketamine, the S (+) enantiomer of ketamine, is the most widely used form in the anesthetic environment in some countries, and new studies have shown that it may also be effective in depression and with better tolerability. However, no study so far has directly compared esketamine with racemic ketamine. Here we propose a protocol of a clinical trial to evaluate esketamine as a noninferior medication when compared to ketamine in the treatment of patients with treatment-resistant depression. METHODS/DESIGN: This study protocol is for a randomized, controlled, double-blind noninferiority clinical trial. Subjects will be 18 years or older, with major depression characterized as treatment-resistant. Participants will receive a single infusion of either esketamine (0.25 mg/kg) or ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) over 40 minutes. The primary outcome will be the difference in remission rates between the 2 treatment arms at 24 and 72 hours after drug infusion. Secondary outcomes will include other timepoints, measurements of cognition, dissociation, and blood biomarkers. DISCUSSION: A head-to-head study is the best way to evaluate whether the esketamine is in fact comparable to the racemic ketamine in terms of both efficacy and safety, and, if positive, it would be an initial step to increase the access to that type of treatment worldwide. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the local Institutional Review Board (University Hospital Professor Edgard Santos-Federal University of Bahia-Number: 46657415.0.0000.0049). Subjects will only participate after voluntarily agreeing and signing the Informed Consent Form.

591,"Prediction of repeated-dose intravenous ketamine response in major depressive disorder using the GWAS-based machine learning approach.^\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common psychiatric disorders. Various clinical studies have shown that the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine has rapid, robust, and sustained antidepressant effects. However, given the concerns about the adverse effects of ketamine on patients, it would be important to identify a set of biomarkers that could be used to predict clinical outcomes for its treatment. A total of 83 MDD patients received treatment with six ketamine infusions for up to 2 weeks and were classified into ""responders"" or ""non-responders"" based on an average change in the HAMD score >50% from baseline. A nested cross-validation approach was applied to prevent information leakage and overestimation of model performance. The initial dataset was divided randomly into training and test sets in a nested six-fold cross-validation. We first performed genome-wide logistic regression to find potentially significant variants related to treatment response and then selected the top SNPs based on the genetic association results using the random forests algorithm. Subsequently, six machine learning models were employed to construct prediction models by using ten-fold cross-validation. A series of model comparisons showed that the best performing fold was characterized by accuracy of 0.85, precision of 0.75, and a sensitivity of 1.00 with the support vector machine algorithm.

9173,"Acute and Longer-Term Outcomes Using Ketamine as a Clinical Treatment at the Yale Psychiatric Hospital.^\nOBJECTIVE: Ketamine has emerged as a rapid-acting antidepressant, though controversy remains whether sufficient data exist to justify its use outside of research protocols. In October 2014, the authors' institution began providing ketamine as an off-label therapy on a case-by-case basis for patients unable to participate in research protocols. Here, the participant experience during 29 months of providing ketamine as a clinical treatment for severe and treatment-resistant mood disorders through February 2017 is described. METHODS: Patients were initially treated with a single- or double-infusion protocol (0.5 mg/kg for 40 minutes intravenously) and were later transitioned to a 4-infusion protocol over 2 weeks. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients received ketamine, with 518 total infusions performed. A subset of 44 patients with mood disorders initiated the 4-infusion protocol, of whom 45.5% responded and 27.3% remitted by the fourth infusion. A subsample (n = 14) received ketamine on a long-term basis, ranging from 12 to 45 total treatments, over a course of 14 to 126 weeks. No evidence was found of cognitive decline, increased proclivity to delusions, or emergence of symptoms consistent with cystitis in this subsample. CONCLUSIONS: In general, ketamine infusions were tolerated well. The response and remission rates in this clinical sample were lower than those observed in some research protocols.

8889,"Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration.

178,"Effect of LSD and music on the time-varying brain dynamics.^\nRATIONALE: Psychedelics are getting closer to being widely used in clinical treatment. Music is known as a key element of psychedelic-assisted therapy due to its psychological effects, specifically on the emotion, meaning-making, and sensory processing. However, there is still a lack of understanding in how psychedelics influence brain activity in experimental settings involving music listening. OBJECTIVES: The main goal of our research was to investigate the effect of music, as a part of ""setting,"" on the brain states dynamics after lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) intake. METHODS: We used an open dataset, where a group of 15 participants underwent two functional MRI scanning sessions under LSD and placebo influence. Every scanning session contained three runs: two resting-state runs separated by one run with music listening. We applied K-Means clustering to identify the repetitive patterns of brain activity, so-called brain states. For further analysis, we calculated states' dwell time, fractional occupancy and transition probability. RESULTS: The interaction effect of music and psychedelics led to change in the time-varying brain activity of the task-positive state. LSD, regardless of the music, affected the dynamics of the state of combined activity of DMN, SOM, and VIS networks. Crucially, we observed that the music itself could potentially have a long-term influence on the resting-state, in particular on states involving task-positive networks. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that music, as a crucial element of ""setting,"" can potentially have an influence on the subject's resting-state during psychedelic experience.

This procedure is not in practice in Hungary at present, the aim of our work to reproduce the findigs of international studies in domestic circumstances. Matter - Major depression is a common, chronic and severe mental disorder, with 16.2% lifetime prevalence. Many international randomized, placebo controlled trials found administration of ketamine infusion effective in depressed patients. Methods - Since ketamine is an anesthetic agent, its administration was performed in the post-operative monitoring room of our hospital operating-room, supervised by an anesthesiologist. According to formerly published data, a dose of 0.5 mg/kg of body weight was administered intravenously in 40 minutes by perfusor. The drug was administered in a same manner fifteen days later. Subject - The patient was admitted to our inpatient ward with severe depression. During two months of combined antidepressant therapy her condition has not improved significantly. Approval for off label drug indication was granted with urgency by the National Institute of Quality and Organizational Development in Healthcare and Medicines. Results - During the two treatments the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 21 items rating scale score was reduced to 8 from the baseline 28, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale score was reduced to 6 from 25, Beck Depression Inventory was reduced to 9 from 20. Upon administration of the drug no severe adverse event was detected, the mild dissociative state related to ketamine was ceased in a short period of time. Discussion - With administration of 0.5 mg/kg ketamine the authors managed to achieve rapid improvement in a therapy resistant depressed patient, without permanent side effects.

5457,"Altered neuroendocrine and behavioral responses to m-chlorophenylpiperazine in 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) users.^\nRATIONALE: (+/-) 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""Ecstasy"") is a popular drug of abuse and a brain serotonin neurotoxin in animals. Growing evidence indicates that humans are also susceptible to MDMA's neurotoxic effects, although few functional consequences of MDMA-induced 5-HT damage have been identified. OBJECTIVE: The present study sought to determine whether possible differences between MDMA users and control subjects could be unmasked by utilizing a pharmacological challenge with the mixed 5-HT agonist, meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP). It was postulated that 5-HT neurotoxicity in MDMA users would be associated with altered 5-HT responsivity, exemplified by altered physiological and behavioral responses to m-CPP. METHODS: Twenty-five MDMA users who had not taken MDMA for at least 3 weeks and 25 controls received intravenous placebo (normal saline) and m-CPP (0.08 mg/kg) in a fixed order, single blind design. Repeated measures of mood, physical symptoms, and blood samples for neuroendocrine analyses were collected during the 90 min after each infusion. RESULTS: MDMA users reported more positive and fewer negative emotions and physical symptoms following m-CPP than controls, and were significantly less likely to report an m-CPP-induced panic attack. Male MDMA users had diminished cortisol and prolactin responses to m-CPP. CONCLUSIONS: The present data indicate that MDMA users have alterations in 5-HT neuronal function, possibly as a consequence of MDMA-induced brain serotonin neural injury.",0,"[0.8590483665466309, 0.005852465517818928, 0.004273153841495514, 0.004204039461910725, 0.12662211060523987]",0

The instrument was a self-reported and anonymous questionnaire. Results: The sample's mean age was 24 years, mostly composed by single, college graduated middle-class subjects. Among the interviewed users, 61.6% used ecstasy at least once per week and 50% of them took one pill per episode of use and 46% more than one. Drug taking was usually performed in company of several people (63%) in contexts related to night leisure, such as rave parties (78.8%), dancing clubs (69.2%) and parties (53.8%). Ecstasy pills were mainly purchased from friends or acquaintances in order to favor a dancing mood in those places. Most subjects used ecstasy associated to other psychoactive drugs (93.3%), mainly Cannabis, followed by tobacco and LSD. The effects attributed to ecstasy were mainly positive.

8795,"Psilocybin Therapy for Major Depressive Disorder: A Systematic Review.^\nIntroduction: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent and complex mood disorder. Its psychotherapies often involve delayed treatment-response times, while its pharmacotherapies can cause unwanted side effects. In recent years, there has been a resurgence in psychedelic research with a specific interest in the potential of psilocybin for treating MDD. Therefore, this systematic review was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of psilocybin therapy at moderate (15±5 mg/70 kg) to high (25 ± 5 mg/70 kg) doses in the psychiatric treatment of MDD. Methods: The review included a literature search using PubMed (Medline), SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Medline (Ovid) databases from January 1, 2013, to February 28, 2023. Seven studies were included following the inclusion and exclusion criteria (e.g., moderate to high dosing psilocybin treatment, peer-reviewed, moderate to severe depression, control/delayed treatment groups, and non-directive therapy during psilocybin sessions). Studies were excluded using PRISMA guidelines and appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklists. Results: The primary outcomes assessed included changes in depression scores on validated diagnostic tools and secondary outcomes that supported depression remission (e.g., improved well-being and rumination scores, and decreased anxiety scores). Psilocybin was found to reduce depression symptoms in moderate single-dose contexts and have minimal reported side effects at high doses. A positive relationship was observed between the quality of psilocybin-induced experiences and the reduction in depressive symptoms. Additionally, a dose-response relationship was found between moderate (15±5 mg/70 kg) and high-dose psilocybin (25 ± 5 mg/70 kg), with greater improvements generally seen in higher dose conditions. Discussion: This review suggests that psilocybin can be an effective treatment option for MDD. Psilocybin shows meaningful improvements in depression scores with the potential to treat psychiatric conditions concurrent to depression. The non-directive therapy approach during high-dose sessions enabled unique psychedelic and personal experiences, potentially allowing more profound and individualized therapy. Reported side effects were minimal, and suggestions for future studies are provided. Conclusion: Psilocybin therapy was found to reduce depression levels and improve secondary outcomes that support depression remission, indicating efficacy for MDD and other depressive conditions. Despite seeming promising, further research is required before introducing PAP options to mainstream clinical practice. © Kaden L. Venugopal.

8062,"Ketamine augmentation for major depressive disorder and suicidal ideation: Preliminary experience in an inpatient psychiatry setting.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is known to rapidly reduce depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation (SI) in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), but evidence is limited for its acceptability and effectiveness in ""real-world"" settings. This case series examines serial ketamine infusions in reducing SI and depression scores in adults with MDD admitted to a tertiary care hospital. METHODS: Five inpatients with MDD and SI admitted to hospital in Toronto, Canada received six infusions of 0.5 mg/kg intravenous (IV) ketamine (n = 5) over approximately 12 days, in addition to treatment-as-usual. Suicide and depression rating scores (Scale for Suicidal Ideation, SSI; Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale, MADRS) were obtained at baseline, on treatment days, on days 14 and 42 (primary endpoint). RESULTS: All patients experienced benefit with ketamine. SSI scores diminished by 84% from 14.0 ± 4.5 at baseline to 2.2 ± 2.5 at study endpoint. MADRS scores diminished by 47% from 42.2 ± 5.3 at baseline to 22.4 ± 8.0. Two patients withdrew from the study, one to initiate electroconvulsive therapy and one due to an adverse event (dissociative effects) during the ketamine infusion. LIMITATIONS: The major limitation of this study is the small sample size. DISCUSSION: These preliminary pilot data are promising with a greater than two-fold reduction in SI following ketamine infusions. They demonstrate that six serial ketamine infusions may be safe and feasible. These findings support the need for large scale randomized controlled trials to confirm the efficacy of serial ketamine for treatment of SI in ""real-world"" settings.",2,"[0.002903575077652931, 0.1820467859506607, 0.7823613882064819, 0.005850416142493486, 0.026837894693017006]",2

8752,"Meta-Analysis: Hemodynamic Responses to Sub-anesthetic Doses of Ketamine in Patients With Psychiatric Disorders.^\nKetamine, a medication traditionally used as an anesthetic, has increasingly been recognized as an effective treatment for psychiatric disorders. At sub-anesthetic doses (defined here as <= 0.5 mg/kg), ketamine treatment has been studied in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and social anxiety disorder (SAD). Transient increases in hemodynamic activity have been reported during and after ketamine treatment, which may be desirable properties in some anesthesia settings, but are generally undesirable in psychiatric settings. While ketamine doses used in psychiatry are lower than those used in anesthesia, there are published instances of early termination of psychiatric ketamine infusions due to elevations in blood pressure and heart rate. No unifying study has been conducted to examine the impact of sub-anesthetic ketamine doses on hemodynamic parameters [systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate (HR)] in psychiatric populations and to evaluate these changes across adult age groups. Here, data from 15 articles comprising a total N = 2,252 ketamine or esketamine treatments in adult participants were used to conduct a meta-analysis of treatment-induced hemodynamic changes. Ketamine/esketamine produced modest but significant increases in the variables of interest with an average SBP increase of 12.61 mm Hg (95% CI 10.40-14.82 mm Hg, z = 11.18, p < 0.0001), average DBP increase of 8.49 mm Hg (95% CI 6.89-10.09 mmHg, z = 10.41, p < 0.0001), and average heart rate increase of 4.09 beats per minute (95% CI 0.55-7.63 BPM), z = 2.27, p = 0.0235). Stratified subgroup analysis indicated no significant differences between ketamine and esketamine effects on blood pressure. Further analysis indicated that there was no significant effect of age on ketamine-induced changes in SBP, DBP, and HR. Taken together these data show that sub-anesthetic ketamine and esketamine induce small but significant increases in hemodynamic parameters that are transient in nature in adult psychiatric populations.

2477,"The effects of esketamine and treatment expectation in acute major depressive disorder (Expect): study protocol for a pharmacological fMRI study using a balanced placebo design.^\nBACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent (8-15%), severely disabling disorder and is associated with enormous socioeconomic impact. Antidepressant medication for the treatment of MDD has proven effective in RCTs; however, placebo response is also substantial. Given the potential benefits of modulating the placebo response in patient care and pharmacological research, understanding the mechanisms underlying placebo response is of high clinical relevance. The placebo response is mediated by treatment expectation, i.e. an individual's belief about whether and how much they will improve as a consequence of their treatment. The mechanisms and moderators of treatment expectation effects in MDD are poorly understood. Initial brain imaging studies on placebo responses in MDD point towards the relevance of the lateral prefrontal cortex and the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC). In this project, we will investigate the neural mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects of treatment expectation associated with the fast-acting antidepressant esketamine in patients with MDD. Esketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist inducing antidepressant effects within hours. METHODS: We will employ a fully balanced placebo design with the factors ""treatment"" (i.v. esketamine / placebo) and verbally induced ""expectation"" (high / low) combined with fMRI (resting state, emotion and reward processing paradigms) to investigate the psychological and neural mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects of expectation, and how these interact with the pharmacological effects of esketamine. DISCUSSION: The insights gained by this project promise fundamental implications for clinical treatment and future drug trials. Unraveling the mechanisms underlying expectation effects on antidepressant treatment may inform (1) strategies to modulate these effects and thus improve assay sensitivity in RCTs and (2) novel treatment regiments aiming to maximize the synergistic effects of expectation and pharmacological treatment in the clinical care of patients with MDD.

7816,"Coping style and ecstasy use motives as predictors of current mood symptoms in ecstasy users.^\nBackground: Elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms during childhood and adolescence have been associated with greater risk of later ecstasy use. Ecstasy users have reported using ecstasy to reduce depression or worry, or to escape. While these findings suggest that some people use ecstasy as a form of self-medication, limited research has been conducted examining the relationship between affective symptoms, coping styles and drug use motives in ecstasy users. This cross-sectional study aimed to determine if coping style and/or ecstasy use motives are associated with current mood symptoms in ecstasy users. Methods: A community sample (n=184) of 18-35. year olds who had taken ecstasy at least once in the past 12. months completed self-report measures of depression, anxiety, ecstasy use motives and coping styles. Timeline followback methods were used to collect information on lifetime ecstasy, recent drug use and life stress. Trauma exposure was measured using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Trauma List. Results: Coping motives for ecstasy use and an emotion-focused coping style were significantly associated with current depressive and anxiety symptoms. Emotion-focused coping mediated the relationship between a history of trauma and current anxiety symptoms and moderated the relationship between recent stressful life events and current depressive symptoms.

9613,"Chronic 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) Use Is Related to Glutamate and GABA Concentrations in the Striatum But Not the Anterior Cingulate Cortex.^\nBackground: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a widely used recreational substance inducing acute release of serotonin. Previous studies in chronic MDMA users demonstrated selective adaptations in the serotonin system, which were assumed to be associated with cognitive deficits. However, serotonin functions are strongly entangled with glutamate as well as γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission, and studies in MDMA-exposed rats show long-term adaptations in glutamatergic and GABAergic signaling. Methods: We used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure the glutamate-glutamine complex (GLX) and GABA concentrations in the left striatum and medial anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of 44 chronic but recently abstinent MDMA users and 42 MDMA-naïve healthy controls. While the Mescher-Garwood point-resolved-spectroscopy sequence (MEGA-PRESS) is best suited to quantify GABA, recent studies reported poor agreement between conventional short-echo-time PRESS and MEGA-PRESS for GLX measures. Here, we applied both sequences to assess their agreement and potential confounders underlying the diverging results. Results: Chronic MDMA users showed elevated GLX levels in the striatum but not the ACC. Regarding GABA, we found no group difference in either region, although a negative association with MDMA use frequency was observed in the striatum. Overall, GLX measures from MEGA-PRESS, with its longer echo time, appeared to be less confounded by macromolecule signal than the short-echo-time PRESS and thus provided more robust results. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that MDMA use affects not only serotonin but also striatal GLX and GABA concentrations.

54,"Ketamine for depression: where do we go from here?.^\nSince publication of the first randomized controlled trial describing rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine, several reports have confirmed the potential utility of this dissociative anesthetic medication for treatment of major depressive episodes, including those associated with bipolar disorder and resistant to other medications and electroconvulsive therapy. These reports have generated several questions with respect to who might respond to ketamine, how, and for how long. To start answering these questions. We used PubMed.gov and ClinicalTrials.gov to perform a systematic review of all available published data on the antidepressant effects of ketamine and of all recently completed, ongoing, and planned studies. To date, 163 patients, primarily with treatment-resistant depression, have participated in case studies, open-label investigations, or controlled trials. All controlled trials have used a within-subject, crossover design with an inactive placebo as the control. Ketamine administration has usually involved an anaesthesiologist infusing a single, subanesthetic, intravenous dose, and required hospitalization for at least 24 hours postinfusion. Response rates in the open-label investigations and controlled trials have ranged from 25% to 85% at 24 hours postinfusion and from 14% to 70% at 72 hours postinfusion. Although adverse effects have generally been mild, some patients have experienced brief changes in blood pressure, heart rate, or respiratory rate.

5545,"Anxiety, depression, and behavioral symptoms of executive dysfunction in ecstasy users: Contributions of polydrug use.^\nBackground: Given ecstasy's (MDMA) potential serotonergic neurotoxicity, it is plausible that regular ecstasy users would have an elevated prevalence of behavioral executive dysfunction or mood symptoms. However, recent studies have found that the relationship between ecstasy use and psychological symptoms was no longer significant after controlling for marijuana use (e.g., Morgan et al., 2002). The goal of the present study was to examine the relationship between ecstasy exposure and self-reported executive functioning and psychological symptoms after controlling for gender, ethnicity, and other drug use. Methods: Data were collected from 65 men and women with a wide range of ecstasy use (including 17 marijuana-using controls). Participants were administered the Frontal Systems Behavioral Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for adults, and the Beck Depression Inventory-2nd edition. Results: Although 19-63% of the ecstasy users demonstrated clinically elevated psychological symptoms, frequency of ecstasy use did not predict the psychological symptoms. No gender differences or interactions were observed. Conclusions: These results revealed that, although ecstasy users demonstrate elevated levels of psychological symptoms and executive dysfunction, these symptoms are not statistically associated with their ecstasy consumption.

3604,"Ketamine-dependent neuronal activation in healthy volunteers.^\nOver the last years, a number of studies have been conducted to clarify the neurobiological correlates of ketamine application. However, comprehensive information regarding the influence of ketamine on cortical activity is still lacking. Using resting‐state functional MRI and integrating pharmacokinetic information, a double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled, crossover study was performed to determine the effects of ketamine on neuronal activation. During a 55 min resting‐state fMRI scan, esketamine (Ketanest S®) was administered intravenously to 35 healthy volunteers. Neural activation as indicated by the BOLD signal using the pharmacokinetic curve of ketamine plasma levels as a regressor was computed. Compared with placebo, ketamine‐dependent increases of neural activation were observed in the midcingulate cortex, the dorsal part of the anterior cingulate cortex, the insula bilaterally, and the thalamus (t values ranging between 5.95‐9.78, p < 0.05; FWE‐corrected). A significant decrease of neural activation in the ketamine condition compared to placebo was found in a cluster within the subgenual/subcallosal part of the anterior cingulate cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex and the gyrus rectus (t = 7.81, p < 0.05, FWE‐corrected).

7419,"The harmful health effects of recreational ecstasy: a systematic review of observational evidence.^\nOBJECTIVES: To investigate the harmful health effects of taking ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA) for recreational purposes. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Web of Knowledge were searched. Additional information on deaths was collected from the General Mortality Register (GMR) and the Special Mortality Register collated by the National Programme on Substance Abuse Deaths (np-SAD). REVIEW METHODS: Studies were categorised according to design, with systematic research syntheses (Level I evidence) the most valid and least open to bias. Where Level I evidence was not available, controlled observational studies (Level II evidence) were systematically reviewed. If neither Level I nor Level II evidence was available, uncontrolled case series and case reports (Level III evidence) were systematically surveyed. Data were extracted by one reviewer and a sample checked by a second. The heterogeneity of Level II evidence was addressed by undertaking stratified analyses for current and former ecstasy users and comparing them either with control groups using other illegal drugs but not ecstasy (polydrug controls) or with controls naïve to illegal drugs (drug-naïve controls). Statistical heterogeneity was minimised by using a random-effects model throughout and investigated using study-level regression analysis (metaregression). RESULTS: Five Level I syntheses were identified; for each it was difficult to ascertain the exact methods adopted and evidence included. Small but significant deficits for ecstasy users compared to controls were reported in areas relating to attention, memory, psychomotor speed, executive systems functioning, and self-reported depressive symptoms. Data from Level II studies were directly pooled for seven individual outcomes, suggesting that ecstasy users performed worse than controls on common measures of immediate and delayed verbal recall (RAVLT, RBMT, digit span). No difference was seen in IQ (NART). The 915 outcome measures identified in Level II studies were analysed in broad domains: immediate and delayed verbal and visual memory, working memory, two measures of attention, three measures of executive function, perceptual organisation, self-rated depression, memory and anxiety, and impulsivity measured objectively and subjectively. Ecstasy users performed significantly worse than polydrug controls in 13/16 domains and significantly worse than drug-naïve controls in 7/12 domains for which sufficient data were available. The largest, most consistent exposure effects were seen in meta-analyses of memory (especially verbal and working memory, with less marked effects seen in visual memory). Former ecstasy users frequently showed deficits that matched or exceeded those seen amongst current users. At aggregate level, the effects do not appear to be dose-related, but are variably confounded by other drug use, particularly alcohol. Of Level III evidence, in the 10 years to 2006, the np-SAD and the GMR recorded an average of around 50 drug-related deaths per year involving ecstasy; it was the sole drug implicated in around 10 cases per year. Retrospective case series, based on hospital emergency department records, reported a death rate of 0-2% from emergency admissions related to ecstasy. Two major syndromes are most commonly reported as the immediate cause of death in fatal cases: hyperthermia and hyponatraemia. CONCLUSIONS: A broad range of relatively low-quality literature suggests that recreational use of ecstasy is associated with significant deficits in neurocognitive function (particularly immediate and delayed verbal memory) and increased psychopathological symptoms. The clinical significance of the exposure effect in individual cases will be variable but, on average, deficits are likely to be relatively small. Ecstasy is associated with a range of acute harms but appears to be a rare cause of death in isolation.",3,"[0.008092804811894894, 0.004550840239971876, 0.003955923952162266, 0.9787197709083557, 0.0046806419268250465]",3
6644,"The effects of psilocybin on the dynamics of eeg changes in human volunteers.^\nPsilocybin is a serotonergic psychedelic with an agonist activity at 5‐HT2A/C and 5‐HT1A receptors. It is used as a research tool to study neurobiology of psychosis as well as it is gaining attention as a possible therapeutic tool to treat depression, anxiety, and addiction. It has been already shown that psychedelics, including psilocybin, acutely induce desynchronization of the alpha activity occipitally and disconnection during the peak of intoxication. However, understanding of the dynamics of these changes has not been evaluated yet. Therefore, the current study focuses on the behavioral and EEG effects of psilocybin at several time points during the 6 hours of intoxication. Twenty volunteers with a balanced gender ratio (10 male/10 female) entered the study. Each participant underwent 2 sessions with oral psilocybin (0.26 mg/kg) or a placebo in a double‐blinded crossover design. In most of the subjects, psilocybin induced fully psychedelic effects as measured by psychometric scales, the effects peaked between 1 and 2 hours after administration. Decreased current density of the alpha band in the occipital region, which diminished over time was the most robust finding. The connectivity analyses showed biphasic effect on overall connectivity indicating two different connectivity states at the peak of intoxication and 6 hours after the ingestion.

764,"RESULTS FROM THE PHASE I SMALL PHARMA TRIAL OF SPL026 IN PSYCHEDELIC-NAÏVE HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS.^\nBackground/Objective: Small Pharma is conducting the world's first regulated Phase I/IIa clinical trial of SPL026 (N,Ndimethyltryptamine [DMT] fumarate), a psychedelic compound with a shortacting experience, in combination with psychotherapy, in major depressive disorder (MDD). Design: We have completed the Phase I component, a double‐blind, singleascending dose study, assessing safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of four intravenous (IV) doses of SPL026 with therapy in psychedelic‐naive healthy volunteers (6 active and 2 placebo per cohort). Results: SPL026 was safe and well tolerated, with no serious adverse events and few drug‐related adverse events across all dose cohorts. Detailed PK profiles for DMT were elucidated, and a model was developed to understand and predict the PK profiles of various doses of SPL026. DMT is rapidly metabolized, with a half‐life of about 11 minutes, which underpins the observed short psychedelic experiences of up to 30 minutes. Following PK/PD analysis, a strong exposureresponse relationship for both the intensity and quality of the psychedelic experience was demonstrated. In addition, no correlation between exposure versus age, weight, or body mass index (BMI) of subjects was shown. Conclusion: We have developed a safe and well‐tolerated IV infusion protocol and accompanying psychotherapy model for administration of SPL026 to elicit, in a dose‐predictive way, a significant psychedelic experience with the potential to provide therapeutic efficacy in a number of mental health disorders. Psychedelics, such as DMT, offer the potential of an alternative treatment paradigm to the traditional selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or psychotherapy models currently available to patients.

9175,"Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to Sustain the Antidepressant Effects of Ketamine in Treatment-Resistant Depression: A Randomized Clinical Trial.^\nINTRODUCTION: Ketamine has emerged as a rapid-acting antidepressant. While ongoing treatment can prevent relapse, concerns exist regarding long-term exposure. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a randomized trial to examine the feasibility and efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) following intravenous ketamine in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). METHODS: Subjects with TRD were recruited and treated with 6 intravenous infusions of ketamine over 3 weeks. Subjects who experienced a clinical response (≥50% improvement in depression severity) were then randomized to receiving CBT or treatment as usual (TAU) for an additional 14 weeks, using a sequential treatment model. RESULTS: Of the 42 patients who signed consent, 28 patients achieved a response and were randomized to CBT or TAU. When measured using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (primary outcome measure), the effect size at the end of the study was moderate (Cohen d = 0.65; 95% CI -0.55 to 1.82), though the group-by-time interaction effect was not significant. There was a significant group-by-time interaction as measured by the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (F = 4.58; p = 0.033), favoring a greater sustained improvement in the CBT group. This corresponded to a moderate-to-large effect size of the Cohen d = 0.71 (95% CI -0.30 to 1.70) at the end of the study (14 weeks following the last ketamine infusion). In a subset of patients (N = 20) who underwent cognitive testing using the emotional N-back assessments before and after ketamine, ketamine responders showed improvement in the accuracy of emotional N-back (t[8] = 2.33; p < 0.05) whereas nonresponders did not (t[10] <1; p ns). CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-concept study provides preliminary data indicating that CBT may sustain the antidepressant effects of ketamine in TRD.

In smaller doses it is reported anecdotally to have stimulant properties. AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the influence of a single 20mg ibogaine dose on psychological variables reflecting subjective mood state and a range of cognitive functions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 21 healthy male volunteers received single 20mg doses of ibogaine after 6 days pretreatment with double-blind paroxetine or placebo. We compared responses to a battery of psychometric tests and subjective mood ratings performed before and 2h after ibogaine dosing, and assessed relationships between changes in test scores and concentrations of active moiety (the sum of molar noribogaine and ibogaine concentrations). Psychological tests were chosen based on responsiveness to opioid and serotonergic ligands. RESULTS: Ibogaine had minimal influence on psychological tests and mood ratings. The ability to selectively ignore distracting spatial information showed some evidence of modulation; however because this effect was limited to the less challenging condition calls into question the reliability of this result. CONCLUSION: We were unable to identify stimulant effects after single 20mg doses of ibogaine.

793,"Subjective and Behavioral Effects of Microdoses of LSD in Healthy Human Volunteers.^\nBackground: There have been numerous anecdotal reports that very low doses of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) reduce depressed mood and improve positive outlook. Yet, the effects of such “microdoses” have not been tested under double‐blind, placebo‐controlled conditions. As a first step, we examined the subjective and behavioral effects of single low doses of LSD in healthy adults. Methods: Volunteers (N=20) attended four laboratory sessions during with they received placebo, 6.5μg, 13μg, or 26μg LSD in randomized order. During expected peak drug effect, they completed mood questionnaires and behavioral tasks assessing emotion processing, including i) recognition of emotional facial expressions and ii) responses to simulated social rejection. Results: LSD dose‐dependently increased ratings of “feeling” the drug, “liking” the drug, and “feeling high,” in addition to dose‐dependently increasing responses to the Altered States of Consciousness questionnaire. The highest dose of LSD increased vigor, elation, and anxiety on the Profile of Mood States. On the emotion recognition task, LSD enhanced participants’ ability to recognize both anger and happiness. During the simulated social rejection task, LSD increased participants’ desire to play again with the other players, but did not affect their perception of the degree to which they were included or excluded. Conclusions: These findings with non‐symptomatic volunteers suggest that “microdoses” of LSD have dose‐dependent effects on mood and emotional behavior. These results set the stage for measuring the clinical efficacy of the drug in the treatment of depressed mood, and help to understand the expanding use of low doses of LSD in the community.

This data may facilitate the discovery of novel biomarkers enabling more personalized treatments and improved patient outcomes. In this single-blind, placebo-controlled study with a non-randomized design, we use time-domain functional near-infrared spectroscopy (TD-fNIRS) to measure acute brain dynamics after intramuscular subanesthetic ketamine (0.75 mg/kg) and placebo (saline) administration in healthy participants (n = 15, 8 females, 7 males, age 32.4 ± 7.5 years) in a clinical setting. We found that the ketamine administration caused an altered state of consciousness and changes in systemic physiology (e.g. increase in pulse rate and electrodermal activity). Furthermore, ketamine led to a brain-wide reduction in the fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations, and a decrease in the global brain connectivity of the prefrontal region. Lastly, we provide preliminary evidence that a combination of neural and physiological metrics may serve as predictors of subjective mystical experiences and reductions in depressive symptomatology.

Considering the relationship between rumination and depression and the need to identify potential predictors of response to ketamine, we analyzed the effect of a single injection of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg on rumination in treatment-resistant depressive (TRD) patients and explored whether baseline ruminative style and early improvements of rumination would predict a greater antidepressant effect of ketamine. METHODS: Ten TRD outpatients who participated in a 4-week open study on the antidepressant effect of ketamine also completed the Ruminative Response Scale the day before, the day after, and a week after ketamine administration. RESULTS: We found that in our patients, a single rapid 1-minute intravenous injection of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg was efficacious in reducing rumination, but neither severity of rumination at baseline nor early improvements of rumination after ketamine injection predicted antidepressant response.

This presentation will examine the rationale, methodology, and findings of 2 recent areas of research attention, the use of a psilocybin treatment model for existential anxiety reactive to advanced cancer and the use of an MDMA (3,4‐methylenedioxy‐methamphetamine) treatment model for social anxiety in adults with autism spectrum disorder. Methods: Double‐blind, placebo‐controlled methodologies were utilized in both studies. The psilocybin study utilized a within‐subject control design, with each subject administered 2 blinded treatment sessions, one with the experimental drug and the other with the placebo control. The MDMA study randomized subjects into either the experimental drug group or the placebo group, administering 2 treatment sessions to all subjects. Following the 6‐month data‐collection follow‐up period, the blind was broken and 2 open‐label MDMA sessions were offered to each of the subjects who had been randomized to the placebo group. Results: The psilocybin and MDMA studies each established feasibility as well as effective safety parameters. With the psilocybin investigation, statistically significant reductions in anxiety were identified at various points over the 6‐month follow‐up period, along with a notable reduction in depression scores at the 6‐month data point. The MDMA study demonstrated a drug effect size of 1.4 for reduction of social anxiety.

The effects on cognitive function of multiple ketamine infusions and of concurrent antidepressant medication on response rate and duration are not known. METHOD: Twenty-eight patients with uni- or bipolar TRD were treated over three weeks with either three or six ketamine infusions (0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes) in the recovery room of a routine ECT clinic. Post-treatment memory assessments were conducted on day 21 (4-7 days after the final infusion). Patients were followed up for six months where possible, with severity of depression and side effects monitored throughout. RESULTS: Eight (29%) patients responded of whom four remitted. Only three (11%) patients had responded within six hours after a single infusion, but in all responders, the response had developed before the third infusion. The duration of response from the final infusion was variable (median 70, range 25-168 days).

6191,"Naturalistic Study of Microdosing With Psilocybin.^\nSub‐threshold doses of serotonergic psychedelics are frequently consumed as cognitive enhancers, and due to their purported positive effects on mood, energy and creativity (""microdosing""). The acute and short‐term effects of psilocybin (the psychoactive compound of Psilocybe cubensis mushrooms) on several variables will be investigated, comprising spontaneous and evoked electrophysiological brain activity, perception and cognitive function (cognitive flexibility, attention, inhibitory control, conscious access, visual perception), creativity (problem solving, divergent and convergent thinking), behavior (actigraphy and sleep patterns, natural language production) and several domains related to well‐being and mental health of the participants. This study is simultaneously naturalistic (i.e. recruited subjects are intrinsically motivated to microdose, as they have decided to embark in a microdosing protocol) and controlled by expectations, following a double‐blind placebo‐controlled design.

7573,"Modulation of the functional connectome in major depressive disorder by ketamine therapy.^\nBackground: Subanesthetic ketamine infusion therapy can produce fast-acting antidepressant effects in patients with major depression. How single and repeated ketamine treatment modulates the whole-brain functional connectome to affect clinical outcomes remains uncharacterized. Methods: Data-driven whole brain functional connectivity (FC) analysis was used to identify the functional connections modified by ketamine treatment in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). MDD patients (N = 61, mean age = 38, 19 women) completed baseline resting-state (RS) functional magnetic resonance imaging and depression symptom scales. Of these patients, n = 48 and n = 51, completed the same assessments 24 h after receiving one and four 0.5 mg/kg intravenous ketamine infusions. Healthy controls (HC) (n = 40, 24 women) completed baseline assessments with no intervention. Analysis of RS FC addressed effects of diagnosis, time, and remitter status. Results: Significant differences (p < 0.05, corrected) in RS FC were observed between HC and MDD at baseline in the somatomotor network and between association and default mode networks. These disruptions in FC in MDD patients trended toward control patterns with ketamine treatment. Furthermore, following serial ketamine infusions, significant decreases in FC were observed between the cerebellum and salience network (SN) (p < 0.05, corrected). Patient remitters showed increased FC between the cerebellum and the striatum prior to treatment that decreased following treatment, whereas non-remitters showed the opposite pattern.

9608,"Compounded intranasal racemic ketamine for major depressive disorder: A case report.^\nKetamine has been safely used as an anesthetic for over 50 years. More recently sub-anesthetic doses have shown benefit for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The majority of data on ketamine for depression is based on intravenous administration which is resource intensive and logistically challenging. Due to these concerns, novel modes of administration, including intranasal, are being explored. In 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a commercially formulated intranasal s-enantiomer ketamine product, esketamine, for TRD. The cost of intranasal esketamine is significant and phase III clinical trials have not consistently demonstrated benefit over placebo. We describe a case of a patient with major depressive disorder (MDD) and acute suicidality who achieved rapid remission following three treatments with intranasal racemic ketamine. The associated drug cost was $42 USD, significantly cheaper than commercially available esketamine, and treatment was administered on an inpatient psychiatry ward with basic hemodynamic monitoring. Intranasal ketamine was not associated with significant adverse drug effects and facilitated a relatively short hospital admission. The case report provides support for the use of intranasal racemic ketamine as adjunctive treatment for MDD.

1631,"Factors associated with Ecstasy use in Turkish students.^\nAIMS: The purpose of this study was to establish the factors associated with Ecstasy use in secondary school students in Turkey. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a survey of a representative sample drawn from cities in different geographical regions in Turkey in 1998 and 2001. The questionnaire was administered to a total of 18,556 and 11,911 10th-grade students in 1998 and 2001, respectively. MEASUREMENTS: The questionnaire administered in the study was adapted from the questionnaires used in 'Monitoring the Future' study in the United States and ESPAD (the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs). It included questions about demographic characteristics, family characteristics, school life, social contacts and use of substances. FINDINGS: While the percentage of those who used Ecstasy at least once in their life-times was 2.65% in 1998, the figure reached 3.31% in 2001. Male gender, older age, use of alcohol, cannabis, heroin and cocaine, non-medical use of psychotherapeutic drugs and participation in a meeting concerning the adverse effects of substance use were found to be significant variables predicting 'ever use' of Ecstasy in both years by logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Ecstasy use, while low in Turkey, appears to be on the increase and follows a pattern in terms of correlates that is similar to other illicit drugs. Whatever the causes behind the rise in Ecstasy use, creative, personalized and informative educational programmes should be conducted in all educational institutions to curb Ecstasy use.",0,"[0.678129255771637, 0.10253189504146576, 0.024411166086792946, 0.015395399183034897, 0.17953230440616608]",0
4988,"Use of ketamine and esketamine for depression: an overview of systematic reviews with meta-analyses.^\nPURPOSE: To summarize the evidence of efficacy and safety of the use of ketamine and esketamine for depression. METHODS: A literature search was performed in Medline, the Cochrane Library, LILACS, and CRD until November 2020. We included systematic reviews with meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials on the use of ketamine and esketamine in adult patients with depression. Two authors independently performed the study selection and data extraction. The AMSTAR-2 tool was used to appraise the quality of included reviews. RESULTS: A total of 118 records were identified, and 11 studies fully met the eligibility criteria. Compared to control, ketamine improved the clinical response at 40 min to 1 week and clinical remission at 80 min to 72 h, and esketamine improved both outcomes at 2 h to 4 weeks. Ketamine and esketamine also had a beneficial effect on the depression scales score and suicidality. For adverse events, oral ketamine did not show significant change compared to control, while intranasal esketamine showed difference for any events, such as dissociation, dizziness, hypoesthesia, and vertigo. Most reviews were classified as ""critically low quality,"" and none of them declared the source of funding of the primary studies and assessed the potential impact of risk of bias in primary studies. CONCLUSION: Ketamine and esketamine showed a significant antidepressant action within a few hours or days after administration; however, the long-term efficacy and safety are lacking. In addition, the methodological quality of the reviews was usually critically low, which may indicate the need for higher quality evidence in relation to the theme.",3,"[0.0064510684460401535, 0.0054970975033938885, 0.0038717114366590977, 0.9806035161018372, 0.003576594404876232]",3
1811,"Ayahuasca and tobacco smoking cessation: results from an online survey in Brazil.^\nRationale: Smoking-related disease is a major problem globally. Effective smoking cessation treatments are however limited. Increasing evidence suggests that psychedelics have potential as treatments for substance use disorders and may therefore prove an option in aiding smoking cessation. Objectives: To establish which factors predict smoking cessation in people who reported quitting or reducing smoking following ayahuasca consumption. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional mixed-method study (quantitative and qualitative design) was undertaken using data from an online survey evaluating peoples’ experiences before and after drinking ayahuasca. Multivariate logistic regression was performed with smoking condition (cessation or reduction/relapse) as a dependent variable and demographics, smoking, ayahuasca-related variables and the mystical experience (MEQ30) as predicting factors. Results: A total of 441 responses were grouped according to self-reported smoking status: cessation (n = 305) or reduction/relapse (n = 136) smoking. Logistic regression showed that mystical experience (OR: 1.03; 95% CI [1.00–1.05]) and frequency of ayahuasca intake (OR: 2.16[1.00–4.70]) were protective factors, while positive mood (measured by the MEQ30) during the ayahuasca experience was a risk factor (OR: 0.91[0.85–0.97]). Qualitative thematic analysis identified eight themes (e.g. acquired awareness, spiritual experience, increased motivation) related to the ayahuasca experience and the process of smoking cessation/reduction. Conclusions: Our results suggest that ayahuasca could be used as a potential tool for smoking cessation, and that effects may be mediated by mystical experience. Given the current burden of smoking-related disease and the limited treatment options, studies are needed to investigate the efficacy of psychedelics in smoking cessation.",0,"[0.8526064157485962, 0.009144113399088383, 0.0043106391094625, 0.028781667351722717, 0.10515715926885605]",0

Objectives: to assess the incidence of Ecstasy-attributed problems as reported by novice, moderate and heavy users. Methods: 763 unpaid volunteers took part in a WWW study of recreational drug use. This report is based on the 282 Ecstasy users from that sample, who comprised 109 novice users (1-9 occasions), 136 moderate users (10-99 occasions), and 36 heavy users (+100 occasions). Yes/no responses were automatically recorded to a series of questions covering psychobiological problems experienced when drug-free, which were attributed by the respondents to their Ecstasy use. Results: Depression, memory problems, anxiety, mood fluctuation, poor concentration, infections, tremors/twitches and weight loss, were all significantly associated with the extent of Ecstasy use. Thus memory problems attributed to Ecstasy were reported by 19% of novice users, 52% of heavy users and 73% of heavy users (chi-square 42.74, df = 2, p < 0.001); many of the other variables showed similar trends.

7588,"Toward a typology of hallucinogen users in the United States.^\nBackground: Roughly one in ten American adults have used hallucinogens, and emerging evidence suggests that the prevalence of use is increasing. However, our understanding of the degree to which individuals “specialize” in the use of a particular hallucinogen or are poly-hallucinogen users remains incomplete. Methods: This study examined data from 6381 individuals reporting past-year hallucinogen use in the 2016–2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Logistic regression examined the association between the number of distinct hallucinogens used and psychosocial/behavioral risks, and latent class analysis (LCA) characterized subgroups of hallucinogen users. Results: The vast majority of hallucinogen users, roughly 70%, are not “specialists” who use only one hallucinogen type; rather, lifetime poly-hallucinogen use is the norm. Critically, however, we also see that important differences exist within the population of hallucinogen users—half (51%) could be classified as LSD-Mushroom-Ecstasy users only (this group was disproportionally comprised of youth), nearly one third (30%) were Poly-Hallucinogen users (this group was disproportionately male and non-Hispanic White), and smaller proportions were limited primarily to use of LSD-Mushrooms (6%; these individuals were almost exclusively ages 35 and older) or Ecstasy Only (12%; these individuals were mostly younger adults ages 18–34).

869,"Procedural and declarative memory task performance, and the memory consolidation function of sleep, in recent and abstinent ecstasy/MDMA users.^\nEcstasy/MDMA use has been associated with various memory deficits. This study assessed declarative and procedural memory in ecstasy/MDMA users. Participants were tested in two sessions, 24 h apart, so that the memory consolidation function of sleep on both types of memory could also be assessed. Groups were: drug-naive controls (n = 24); recent ecstasy/MDMA users, who had taken ecstasy/MDMA 2-3 days before the first testing session (n = 25), and abstinent users, who had not taken ecstasy/MDMA for at least 8 days before testing (n = 17). Procedural memory did not differ between groups, but greater lifetime consumption of ecstasy was associated with poorer procedural memory. Recent ecstasy/MDMA users who had taken other drugs (mainly cannabis) 48-24 h before testing exhibited poorer declarative memory than controls, but recent users who had not taken other drugs in this 48-24-h period did not differ from controls. Greater lifetime consumption of ecstasy, and of cocaine, were associated with greater deficits in declarative memory. These results suggest that procedural, as well as declarative, memory deficits are associated with the extent of past ecstasy use.

3728,"Effects of low-dose intranasal (S)-ketamine in patients with neuropathic pain.^\nBackground: NMDA receptors are involved in the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of intranasal (S)-ketamine, one of the most potent clinically available NMDA receptor antagonists. Methods: Sixteen patients with neuropathic pain of various origins were randomized into two treatment groups: (S)-ketamine 0.2 mg/kg (group 1); (S)-ketamine 0.4 mg/kg (group 2). Plasma concentrations of (S)-ketamine and (S)-norketamine were measured over 6 h by High Performance Liquid Chromatography combined with mass spectrometry. Quantitative sensory testing (QST) was conducted before, during and after treatment. Side effects and amount of pain reduction were recorded. Results: Intranasal (S)-ketamine administration lead to peak plasma concentrations of 27.7 ± 5.9 ng/ml at 10 ± 6.3 min (group 1) and 34.3 ± 22.2 ng/ml at 13.8 ± 4.8 min after application (group 2). Maximal plasma concentrations of (S)-norketamine were 18.3 ± 14.9 ng/ml at 81 ± 59 min (group 1) and 34.3 ± 5.5 ng/ml at 75 ± 40 min (group 2). Pain scores decreased significantly in both groups with minimal pain at 60 min after drug administration (70 ± 10% and 61 ± 13% of initial pain in groups 1 and 2). The time course of pain decrease was significantly correlated with plasma concentrations of (S)-ketamine and (S)-norketamine (partial correlations: (S)-norketamine: -0.90 and -0.86; (S)-ketamine: -0.72 and -0.71 for group 1 and group 2, respectively). Higher dosing elicited significantly more side effects. Intranasal (S)-ketamine had no significant impact on thermal or mechanical detection and pain thresholds in normal or symptomatic skin areas. Conclusions: Intranasal administration of low dose (S)-ketamine rapidly induces adequate plasma concentrations of (S)-ketamine and subsequently of its metabolite (S)-norketamine.

A total of 50 cancer patients participated in this experimental treatment program, in which two psychedelic compounds were used as an adjunct to a brief course of intensive psychotherapy. In 40 of of these patients LSD was used perorally in dosages from 200 to 500 mcg, in 7 of these patients dipropyltryptamine (DPT) was administered intramuscularly in doses ranging from 60 to 105 mg. These patients received both LSD and DPT on different occasions. The therapeutic results were assessed by means of a clinical rating scale reflecting the degree of the patient's depression, psychological isolation, anxiety, difficulty in management, acceptance of imminent death, fear of death and pain. The ratings were made by attending physicians, nurses, family members, LSD therapists and co therapists. In addition, the amount of physical pain and/or pain tolerance was assessed on the basis of the amount of narcotics required in the management of the patient. The comparison of the means of individual ratings from pre to post treatment showed significant improvement in all the measured parameters for most of the raters. There was a definite trend toward reduction of the narcotic medication; it did not, however, reach the level of statistical significance. The pre to post treatment comparison of the Global Indexes grossly expressing the degree of emotional and physical distress indicated that approximately 36% of the patients were dramatically improved, 36% moderately improved and 19% essentially unchanged.

9611,"Urgent ketamine infusion rapidly eliminated suicidal ideation for a patient with major depressive disorder: A case report.^\nPresents a case report of a 37-year-old married woman with young children, who worked as a professional. She had 2 prior depressive episodes and had previously been treated with paroxetine with a good response. She also had a remote pituitary adenoma resection, and was treated for B12 deficiency and hypothyroidism. There was no significant psychiatric comorbidity including substance use disorders, anxiety disorders, or personality disorders. There were no symptoms of psychosis or mania/ hypomania. Her current depressive episode began 25 months prior when she was overwhelmed by many stressors at home and at work. At month 3, she started treatment with venlafaxine XR up to 300 mg/d by her family physician. She deteriorated at month 6 when her supervisor confronted her with her declining work performance and she left on disability. Twelve months after her episode began, she enrolled in a clinical trial (unpublished) in our tertiary care psychopharmacology unit. Our case outlines how urgent ketamine was feasible to use in a tertiary care psychiatric outpatient practice to rapidly reduce suicidal ideation a patient with major depressive disorder (MDD). The reinstitution of lithium may have contributed to the long-lasting reduction of suicidal ideation. However, if ketamine was unavailable, we would have sent the patient to the emergency department, where she may have been admitted to the inpatient ward and possibly treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). An inpatient psychiatric admission is expensive, stigmatizing, and disruptive to a patient s family life. Additionally, there is often a delay of several days before ECT can be initiated, leaving patients in distress and at risk of self-harm. In summary, we found it feasible to use ketamine urgently in our clinical practice to reduce suicidal ideation and dysphoria for a patient with MDD. Urgent ketamine could potentially reduce use of psychiatric emergency services and the need for inpatient psychiatric admissions. Patients should be carefully selected and close follow-up must be ensured. Future studies should evaluate whether using ketamine urgently improves patient outcomes, patient satisfaction, and to what extent it affects treatment costs compared to the current standard of care for suicidal crises in MDD, including ECT.

1238,"Efficacy and safety of intranasal esketamine for the rapid reduction of symptoms of major depressive disorder, including suicidal ideation, in patients assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide: a proof-ofconcept study.^\nBackground: Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) have an increased risk of suicide that is 20 times greater than that of general population. The standard of care (SoC) for patients with MDD who are at imminent risk for suicide includes hospitalization and treatment with conventional antidepressants for underlying depression. However, hospitalizations are temporary and do not eliminate the risk of suicide, and conventional antidepressant pharmacotherapies show a delayed onset of action that limits their utility in treating vulnerable patients. Recent clinical studies of the N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine and one of its active isomers, esketamine (ESK), have suggested rapid onset of antidepressant action. In addition, preliminary studies of intravenous ketamine demonstrated rapid reduction of suicidal ideation (SI) in patients with MDD. Intranasal ESK is currently in development for the rapid reduction in symptoms of MDD, including SI, in patients who are assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide. Methods: The PeRSEVERe trial was a randomized, doubleblind (DB), placebo‐controlled, multicenter, phase 2, proofof‐concept study. Eligible patients (aged 18 to 64 years) who met the inclusion criteria of having a DSM‐IV diagnosis of MDD as well as active SI and intent as confirmed by the Mini International Psychiatric Interview (MINI) and of being in need of acute psychiatric hospitalization, were enrolled. The study consisted of a screening phase (24 to 48 hours), a DB treatment phase (day 1 to 25), wherein patients were randomized (1:1) to intranasal ESK (84 mg) or intranasal placebo, administered 2 times/week, and a post‐treatment follow‐up phase (day 26 to 81). All patients received SoC treatment, including hospitalization and oral antidepressants. The primary endpoint for ESK 84 mg+SoC (ESK 84 mg) vs placebo+SoC (placebo) was change from baseline (day 1, predose) to 4 hours postdose on day 1 in MADRS total score. Secondary and exploratory endpoints included change from baseline to day 2 (∼24 hours postdose) in MADRS total score, change from baseline to 4 hours postdose and day 2 in MADRS suicide item and in Clinical Global Judgment of Suicide Risk (CGJ‐SR) measured using the Suicide Ideation and Behavior Assessment Tool (SIBAT), as well as response rate (=50% improvement on MADRS) and remission rate (MADRS total score =12) at day 2. Safety included assessment of treatment‐emergent adverse events (TEAEs), vital signs and Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS) total score. Statistical analyses were performed using analysis of covariance models; as a proofof‐concept study, a two‐sided 0.20 significance level was prespecified to indicate evidence of potential therapeutic effect. Results: Of the 68 patients randomized, 49 (ESK: 27; placebo: 22) completed the DB treatment phase. Mean (SD) baseline MADRS total scores were: 38.5 (6.17) and 38.8 (7.02) for the ESK and placebo groups, respectively. The primary endpoint, change from baseline in MADRS total score at day 1 (4 hours postdose) was significantly greater for ESK treatment compared with placebo (Least‐square [LS] mean difference:‐5.3 [SE: 2.10]; 2‐sided p =0.015). Secondary endpoint findings showed significantly greater change from baseline in MADRS total score at day 2 for ESK treatment vs placebo (LS mean difference:‐7.2 [SE: 2.85]; 2‐sided p =0.015). Patients in the ESK group showed significantly greater improvement vs placebo in the MADRS suicide item at day 1 (4 hours postdose; 2‐sided p =0.002). The ESK treatment showed evidence of potential therapeutic effect vs placebo for the MADRS suicide item at day 2 (2‐sided p =0.129) and CGJ‐SR change from baseline at 4 hours (2‐sided p =0.112) and day 2 (2‐sided p =0.150). A greater proportion of patients in ESK group achieved resolution of suicide risk (CGJ‐SR score of 0 or 1) vs placebo at 4 hours (21.2% [7/33] vs 9.7% [3/31]) and day 2 (40% [14/35] vs 6.5% [2/31]). The response rate at day 2 was higher in ESK group (54.3%; 9/35) vs placebo group (29%; 9/31). Similarly, the remission rate at day 2 was higher for patients treated with ESK (34.3%; 12/35) vs placebo (16.1%; 5/31). During the DB phase, the most common (=20%) TEAEs reported in the ESK group were nausea (37.1%), dizziness (34.3%), dysgeusia, headache and dissociation (31.4% each) and vomiting (20%); 4 patients experienced serious TEAEs during the DB phase (suicide ideation: 2, agitation: 1, depressive symptoms: 1). No death occurred in either group. In the ESK group, the dissociative/perceptual changes measured by CADSS had an onset shortly after the start of intranasal dosing and generally resolved by 2 hours post dose. Conclusions: In patients with MDD who were assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide, intranasal ESK 84 mg demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful effects in reducing depressive symptoms compared with placebo at 4 hours (day 1) and ∼24 hours (day 2) after initial dose. A significant improvement in suicidality (as measured by MADRS suicide item and the CGJ‐SR from SIBAT) was also observed at these time points. Moreover, intranasal ESK treatment exhibited rapid onset of response and greater likelihood of remission in this vulnerable population.

The remission rate for PTSD was 80.0%, and the response rate for TRD was 93.3%. Participants in remission from PTSD after the infusion series (n = 12) had a median time to relapse of 41 days. Similarly, participants whose depression symptoms responded to the infusion series (n = 14) had a median time to relapse of 20 days. Repeated ketamine infusions were associated with transient increases in dissociative symptoms. No participant reported worsening of PTSD symptoms over the study duration. CONCLUSIONS: This study, the first open-label study of repeated ketamine infusions in a comorbid population, found rapid and sustained improvement in PTSD and depression symptoms. This report suggests that repeated ketamine treatments are safe and may represent an efficacious treatment for individuals with comorbid PTSD and TRD.

2373,"Early effects predict trajectories of response to esketamine in treatment-resistant depression.^\nBackground: The efficacy of esketamine in treatment-resistant depression (TRD) has been confirmed. However, its administration is expensive and restrictive, with limited knowledge on how long the treatment should be continued. Predicting the treatment outcome would benefit patients and alleviate the global treatment cost. We aimed to define distinct trajectories of treatment response and assess their predictability. Methods: In this longitudinal study, two independent samples of patients with unipolar or bipolar TRD were treated with esketamine in real-world settings. Depression severity was assessed using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) before each esketamine administration. Latent class analyses were used to define trajectories of response. Results: In the original sample (N = 50), we identified two classes whose trajectories depicted response and non-response, respectively. The model was validated in the confirmatory sample (N = 55). Class membership was influenced by a few baseline characteristics such as concomitant benzodiazepine medication, number of depressive episodes or polarity. On the other hand, after only two esketamine administrations, the MADRS score predicted the 90-day trajectory of response with an accuracy of 80 %. Limitations: This observational study is not placebo-controlled. Therefore, its results and their generalizability need to be confirmed in experimental settings. Conclusions: After the first administrations of esketamine, the MADRS score has a good capacity to predict the most plausible trajectory of response. While thresholds and their predictive values need to be confirmed, this finding suggests that clinicians could base on MADRS scores their decision to discontinue treatment because of poor remaining chances of treatment response.

7943,"A randomized, double-blind, active placebo-controlled study of efficacy, safety, and durability of repeated vs single subanesthetic ketamine for treatment-resistant depression.^\nThe strategy of repeated ketamine in open-label and saline-control studies of treatment-resistant depression suggested greater antidepressant response beyond a single ketamine. However, consensus guideline stated the lack of evidence to support frequent ketamine administration. We compared the efficacy and safety of single vs. six repeated ketamine using midazolam as active placebo. Subjects received either six ketamine or five midazolam followed by a single ketamine during 12 days followed by up to 6-month post-treatment period. The primary end point was the change from baseline in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score at 24 h after the last infusion. Fifty-four subjects completed all six infusions. For the primary outcome measure, there was no significant difference in change of MADRS scores between six ketamine group and single ketamine group at 24 h post-last infusion. Repeated ketamine showed greater antidepressant efficacy compared to midazolam after five infusions before receiving single ketamine infusion. Remission and response favored the six ketamine after infusion 4 and 5, respectively, compared to midazolam before receiving single ketamine infusion. For those who responded, the median time-to-relapse was nominally but not statistically different (2 and 6 weeks for the single and six ketamine group, respectively). Repeated infusions were relatively well-tolerated. Repeated ketamine showed greater antidepressant efficacy to midazolam after five infusions but fell short of significance when compared to add-on single ketamine to midazolam at the end of 2 weeks. Increasing knowledge on the mechanism of ketamine should drive future studies on the optimal balance of dosing ketamine for maximum antidepressant efficacy with minimum exposure.",2,"[0.001850696629844606, 0.017118733376264572, 0.9692732095718384, 0.004524002783000469, 0.007233370095491409]",1
4236,"The efficacy of oral ketamine in severely depressed patients at high risk of suicide.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is most easily and inexpensively administered by the oral route and in racemic form. Oral racemic ketamine may be an important approach to the emergency management of suicide risk in clinical settings, especially in third world countries, that have a limited range of available healthcare resources. METHODS: In a prospective, uncontrolled, open-label investigation, we studied 30 severely depressed inpatients who consented to participate in a pilot hospital service offering ketamine for management of high suicide risk. Patients sipped a solution of racemic ketamine (150 mg) across 10-15 min in 3 alternate day sessions. Patients were assessed using the Modified Scale for Suicidal Ideation (MSSI), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and Clinical Global Improvement-Severity (CGI-S) scale at baseline and 1 day after the last ketamine session. RESULTS: There was statistically and clinically significant improvement on all outcomes. Mean (standard deviation) MSSI scores dropped from 25.1(1.8) to 17.3(5.6), MADRS scores from 28.8(3.4) to 21.9(3.6), and CGI-S scores from 6.0(0.2) to 3.6(0.9). At endpoint, MSSI scores had dropped from severe to low or mild-to-moderate in 67% of patients. The 90 ketamine sessions were uneventful; the treatment was well tolerated and no patient dropped out.

6507,"Rapid antidepressant effect of ketamine anesthesia during electroconvulsive therapy of treatment-resistant depression: comparing ketamine and propofol anesthesia.^\nBACKGROUND: Reports of the superiority of the antidepressant effect of ketamine during the conduct of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) have been limited. We conducted an open-label trial of ketamine to determine whether ketamine as the anesthetic during ECT would provide a greater antidepressant effect than the antidepressant effect obtained with propofol. METHODS: Between April 2006 and April 2007, 31 inpatients with treatment-resistant depression gave written consent for ECT and to participate in this study. An anesthesiologist who was unaware of the mental symptoms of the subjects assigned them to receive propofol or ketamine anesthetic according to the preferences of the patients, and the patients underwent 8 ECT sessions for 4 weeks. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) was valuated before ECT and after the completion of the second, fourth, sixth, and eighth ECT sessions. RESULTS: The HDRS scores improved earlier in the ketamine group, with decreases in HDRS scores that were significantly greater in the ketamine group.

This paper discusses the background, methodology and preliminary findings of the first FDA approved Phase I study prospectively evaluating the effects of MDMA administration in humans. Six subjects with prior experience with MDMA were administered two different dosages of MDMA and an inactive placebo utilizing a randomized, double-blind methodologic design. Dosages from 0.25 to 1.0 mg/kg, p.o., were administered. All subjects tolerated the procedures without any overt evidence of physical discomfort or psychological distress. MDMA produced a modest increase in heart rate and blood pressure. The threshold dose for the stimulation of ACTH and prolactin appeared to be between 0.5 and 0.75 mg/kg, with the two higher doses clearly stimulating both ACTH and prolactin.

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of a psychedelic experience in a natural context on tobacco use. A retrospective online survey was conducted on 173 individuals who reported having had a psychedelic experience while being smokers. Demographic information was collected, and characteristics of the psychedelic experience, tobacco addiction and psychological flexibility were assessed. Mean number of cigarettes smoked per day, and proportion of individuals with high tobacco dependency significantly decreased between the three time points (p <.001). Participants who reduced or quit smoking had more intense mystical experiences during the psychedelic session (p =.01) and lower psychological flexibility before the psychedelic experience (p =.018). The increase in psychological flexibility post psychedelic session, and the personal motives for the psychedelic experience were significant positive predictors of smoking reduction or cessation (p <.001). Our results confirmed that a psychedelic experience in smoker individuals can be associated with smoking and tobacco dependency reduction and that the personal motives for the psychedelic session, the intensity of the mystical experience, and the increase of psychological flexibility following the psychedelic experience, are associated with smoking cessation or reduction.",0,"[0.9090275168418884, 0.007019076030701399, 0.0046592652797698975, 0.005525041837245226, 0.07376901060342789]",0
518,"Intimate insight: MDMA changes how people talk about significant others.^\nRATIONALE: ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is widely believed to increase sociability. The drug alters speech production and fluency, and may influence speech content. Here, we investigated the effect of MDMA on speech content, which may reveal how this drug affects social interactions. METHOD: Thirty-five healthy volunteers with prior MDMA experience completed this two-session, within-subjects, double-blind study during which they received 1.5 mg/kg oral MDMA and placebo. Participants completed a five-minute standardized talking task during which they discussed a close personal relationship (e.g. a friend or family member) with a research assistant. The conversations were analyzed for selected content categories (e.g. words pertaining to affect, social interaction, and cognition), using both a standard dictionary method (Pennebaker's Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count: LIWC) and a machine learning method using random forest classifiers. RESULTS: Both analytic methods revealed that MDMA altered speech content relative to placebo. Using LIWC scores, the drug increased use of social and sexual words, consistent with reports that MDMA increases willingness to disclose. Using the machine learning algorithm, we found that MDMA increased use of social words and words relating to both positive and negative emotions. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with reports that MDMA acutely alters speech content, specifically increasing emotional and social content during a brief semistructured dyadic interaction. Studying effects of psychoactive drugs on speech content may offer new insights into drug effects on mental states, and on emotional and psychosocial interaction.",4,"[0.3368373513221741, 0.010311261750757694, 0.006977019365876913, 0.006734356749802828, 0.6391400098800659]",0

3653,"Gamma and delta neural oscillations and association with clinical symptoms under subanesthetic ketamine.^\nSeveral electrical neural oscillatory abnormalities have been associated with schizophrenia, although the underlying mechanisms of these oscillatory problems are unclear. Animal studies suggest that one of the key mechanisms of neural oscillations is through glutamatergic regulation; therefore, neural oscillations may provide a valuable animal-clinical interface on studying glutamatergic dysfunction in schizophrenia. To identify glutamatergic control of neural oscillation relevant to human subjects, we studied the effects of ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist that can mimic some clinical aspects of schizophrenia, on auditory-evoked neural oscillations using a paired-click paradigm. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of ketamine vs saline infusion on 10 healthy subjects. Clinically, infusion of ketamine in subanesthetic dose significantly increased thought disorder, withdrawal-retardation, and dissociative symptoms. Ketamine significantly augmented high-frequency oscillations (gamma band at 40-85 Hz, p=0.006) and reduced low-frequency oscillations (delta band at 1-5 Hz, p<0.001) compared with placebo. Importantly, the combined effect of increased gamma and reduced delta frequency oscillations was significantly associated with more withdrawal-retardation symptoms experienced during ketamine administration (p=0.02). Ketamine also reduced gating of the theta-alpha (5-12 Hz) range oscillation, an effect that mimics previously described deficits in schizophrenia patients and their first-degree relatives. In conclusion, acute ketamine appeared to mimic some aspects of neural oscillatory deficits in schizophrenia, and showed an opposite effect on scalp-recorded gamma vs low-frequency oscillations. These electrical oscillatory indexes of subanesthetic ketamine can be potentially used to cross-examine glutamatergic pharmacological effects in translational animal and human studies.",4,"[0.4530733823776245, 0.0051264395006000996, 0.004308720119297504, 0.004766274709254503, 0.5327251553535461]",4
1950,"Sustained effects of ecstasy on the human brain: A prospective neuroimaging study in novel users.^\nPrevious studies have suggested toxic effects of recreational ecstasy use on the serotonin system of the brain. However, it cannot be excluded that observed differences between users and non-users are the cause rather than the consequence of ecstasy use. As part of the Netherlands XTC Toxicity (NeXT) study, we prospectively assessed sustained effects of ecstasy use on the brain in novel ecstasy users using repeated measurements with a combination of different neuroimaging parameters of neurotoxicity. At baseline, 188 ecstasy-naive volunteers with high probability of first ecstasy use were examined. After a mean period of 17 months follow-up, neuroimaging was repeated in 59 incident ecstasy users and 56 matched persistent ecstasy-naives and their outcomes were compared. Neuroimaging included [123I]β- carbomethoxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl)tropane (CIT) SPECT to measure serotonin transporter densities as indicators of serotonergic function; 1H-MR spectroscopy (1H-MRS) to measure brain metabolites as indicators of neuronal damage; diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to measure the apparent diffusion coefficient and fractional anisotropy (FA) of the diffusional motion of water molecules in the brain as indicators of axonal integrity; and perfusion weighted imaging (PWI) to measure regional relative cerebral blood volume (rrCBV) which indicates brain perfusion. With this approach, both structural (1H-MRS and DTI) and functional ([123I]β-CIT SPECT and PWI) aspects of neurotoxicity were combined. Compared to persistent ecstasy-naives, novel low-dose ecstasy users (mean 6.0, median 2.0 tablets) showed decreased rrCBV in the globus pallidus and putamen; decreased FA in thalamus and frontoparietal white matter; increased FA in globus pallidus; and increased apparent diffusion coefficient in the thalamus. No changes in serotonin transporter densities and brain metabolites were observed. These findings suggest sustained effects of ecstasy on brain microvasculature, white matter maturation and possibly axonal damage due to low dosages of ecstasy. Although we do not know yet whether these effects are reversible or not, we cannot exclude that ecstasy even in low doses is neurotoxic to the brain. © The Author (2008).
