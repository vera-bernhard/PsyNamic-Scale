1441,"Effects of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism on antidepressant response to low-dose ketamine infusion.^\nEvidence suggests that levels of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs6265 polymorphism are related to the antidepressant effects of conventional antidepressants and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, whether these factors are associated with the antidepressant effects of low-dose ketamine remains unclear. In total, 71 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were randomized to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, and saline control infusion groups. They were further divided into three treatment refractoriness groups according to the Maudsley staging method and were genotyped for Val66Met BDNF polymorphism. Participants' Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were assessed preinfusion, at 40, 80, 120, and 240 min postinfusion, and sequentially on days 2-7 and 14 after infusion. Patients with any Val allele exhibited an antidepressant response (p = 0.029) to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine vs. 0.2 mg/kg ketamine vs. saline control infusions. However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p = 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers. In the low treatment refractoriness group, the 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited the optimal antidepressant effect (p = 0.002); in the moderate treatment refractoriness group, the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion achieved the strongest antidepressant effect (p = 0.006); however, in the high treatment refractoriness group, the trajectory of depressive symptoms did not differ between treatments (p = 0.325). In future clinical practice, ketamine dose may be adjusted according to the level of treatment refractoriness and BDNF rs6265 polymorphism to achieve the optimal antidepressant effect for patients with TRD.","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.985601007938385, 0.9868825078010559, 0.017320770770311356, 0.009597855620086193, 0.010954285971820354, 0.011198372580111027, 0.008946318179368973, 0.007734681945294142, 0.0062498063780367374, 0.011066945269703865, 0.010652108117938042, 0.01151399314403534, 0.01183089055120945, 0.03105148859322071]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
3371,"The effects of sub-anaesthetic doses of ketamine on memory, cognitive performance and subjective experience in healthy volunteers.^\nExamined cognitive and subjective effects of subanesthetic doses of ketamine on 12 healthy volunteers. Ss received 25 mg ketamine, 10 mg ketamine and saline placebo, intramuscular/ly (im) in a double-blind, Latin square design. A cognitive, perceptual and self-report test battery was administered over 45 min. The order of tests was rotated to control for timing effects. Ketamine (25 mg) significantly affected verbal learning and memory, parallel visual search, some measures of psychomotor performance, measures of arousal, subjective mood ratings and visual perception. Measures of attention and frontal lobe functioning were relatively unaffected. Thus, low doses of ketamine had selective, dose-related effects on memory, perceptual and psychomotor functions. The disruption of memory and perceptual processes may help to explain the unique subjective state induced by ketamine.

5380,"Sub-Acute Effects of Psilocybin on Empathy, Creative Thinking, and Subjective Well-Being.^\nCreative thinking and empathy are crucial for everyday interactions and subjective well-being. This is emphasized by studies showing a reduction in these skills in populations where social interaction and subjective well-being are significantly compromised (e.g., depression). Anecdotal reports and recent studies suggest that a single administration of psilocybin can enhance such processes and could therefore be a potential treatment. However, it has yet to be assessed whether effects outlast acute intoxication. The present study aimed to assess the sub-acute effects of psilocybin on creative thinking, empathy, and well-being. Participants attending a psilocybin retreat completed tests of creative (convergent and divergent) thinking and empathy, and the satisfaction with life scale on three occasions: before ingesting psilocybin (N = 55), the morning after (N = 50), and seven days after (N = 22). Results indicated that psilocybin enhanced divergent thinking and emotional empathy the morning after use. Enhancements in convergent thinking, valence-specific emotional empathy, and well-being persisted seven days after use. Sub-acute changes in empathy correlated with changes in well-being. The study demonstrates that a single administration of psilocybin in a social setting may be associated with sub-acute enhancement of creative thinking, empathy, and subjective well-being. Future research should test whether these effects contribute to the therapeutic effects in clinical populations.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.02044290490448475, 0.01361923385411501, 0.0060012685135006905, 0.007396254688501358, 0.005159211810678244, 0.00716207642108202, 0.006188076455146074, 0.004541597329080105, 0.00561713520437479, 0.013830284588038921, 0.007428084500133991, 0.006584186106920242, 0.05751458555459976, 0.9916514754295349]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0]"
6103,"A Multi-Site Study of MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy for PTSD.^\nPTSD is a serious debilitating disorder that negatively impacts a person's daily life. PTSD is a stress‐related psychiatric condition that may occur following a traumatic event such as war, disaster, sexual abuse, violence, terrorism, and accidents. PTSD negatively impacts a person's daily life, resulting in relationship difficulties, difficulty in finding and maintaining a job, reduced cognitive and psychosocial functioning, substance abuse, high‐cost healthcare use, and increased depression and suicide risk. Available PTSD treatments, including medications and therapy, effectively treat only a fraction of people who try them for adequate dose and duration. People with PTSD can be treated with psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies. In the past decade, there has been a growing amount of research into medications and other methods that may augment the effectiveness of psychotherapy for PTSD 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a drug that releases serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain and indirectly increases levels of the neurohormones oxytocin, arginine vasopressin and cortisol. The combined neurobiological effects of MDMA increase compassion, reduce defenses and fear of emotional injury, and enhance communication and introspection. MDMA produces anxiolytic and prosocial effects, which counteract avoidance and hyperarousal in the context of therapy. A combined treatment of MDMA and psychotherapy may be especially useful for treating PTSD. This multi‐site, double‐blind, randomized Phase 3 study assesses the efficacy and safety of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy versus psychotherapy with placebo control in participants diagnosed with at least severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The study will be conducted in N ≈ 100 participants. Participants will be enrolled in one of two groups at a 1:1 ratio. A flexible dose of MDMA or placebo, followed by a supplemental half‐dose unless contraindicated, is administered during the Treatment Period with manualized psychotherapy in three monthly Experimental Sessions. This 12‐week Treatment Period is preceded by three Preparatory Sessions. During the Treatment Period, each Experimental Session is followed by three Integrative Sessions of non‐drug psychotherapy. The Primary Outcome measure is change in Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM 5 (CAPS‐5) from Baseline. Exploratory measures will address specific symptoms, or behavior that is sometimes related to PTSD. Drug safety will be assessed by measuring blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature during experimental sessions, collecting adverse events and measuring suicidal thoughts or behaviors with the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS). This study will compare the effects of three manualized Experimental Sessions of psychotherapy supported by assisted by flexible doses of MDMA versus placebo. Initial doses per Experimental Session include 80 mg or 120 mg of MDMA compounded with mannitol and magnesium stearate or placebo alone (mannitol and magnesium stearate), followed 1.5 to 2 hours later by a supplemental half‐dose (40 or 60 mg).

56,"Single-Dose Synthetic Psilocybin With Psychotherapy for Treatment-Resistant Bipolar Type II Major Depressive Episodes: A Nonrandomized Controlled Trial.^\nIMPORTANCE: Bipolar II disorder (BDII) is a debilitating condition frequently associated with difficult-to-treat depressive episodes. Psilocybin has evidence for rapid-acting antidepressant effects but has not been investigated in bipolar depression. OBJECTIVE: To establish the safety and efficacy of psilocybin in patients with BDII in a current depressive episode. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a 12-week, open-label nonrandomized controlled trial conducted at Sheppard Pratt Hospital. Participants aged 18 to 65 years with BDII, a current depressive episode longer than 3 months, and documented insufficient benefit with at least 2 pharmacologic treatments during the current episode were invited to participate. Of 70 approached, 19 met inclusion criteria and were enrolled. The trial was conducted between April 14, 2021, and January 5, 2023. INTERVENTIONS: A single dose of synthetic psilocybin, 25 mg, was administered. Psychotropic medications were discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to dosing. Therapists met with patients for 3 sessions during pretreatment, during the 8-hour dosing day, and for 3 integration sessions posttreatment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was change in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating scale (MADRS) at 3 weeks posttreatment. Secondary measures included MADRS scores 12 weeks posttreatment, the self-rated Quick Inventory of Depression Symptoms-Self Rating (QIDS-SR), and the self-rated Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF), each completed at baseline and all subsequent visits. Safety measures included the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) and the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) completed at each visit. RESULTS: Of the 15 participants in this study (6 male and 9 female; mean [SD] age, 37.8 [11.6] years), all had lower scores at week 3, with a mean (SD) change of -24.00 (9.23) points on the MADRS, (Cohen d = 4.08; 95% CI, -29.11 to -18.89; P < .001). Repeat measures analysis of variance showed lower MADRS scores at all tested posttreatment time points, including the end point (Cohen d = 3.39; 95% CI, -33.19 to -16.95; adjusted P < .001). At week 3, 12 participants met the response criterion (50% decrease in MADRS), and 11 met remission criterion (MADRS score ≤10). At the study end point, 12 patients met both response and remission criteria. QIDS-SR scores and Q-LES-Q-SF scores demonstrated similar improvements. YMRS and CSSRS scores did not change significantly at posttreatment compared to baseline.

An anonymous web-based questionnaire containing questions on drug use and sleep was completed by 1035 individuals. From this large sample, a group of 89 ecstasy users were found who reported very little use of other drugs. This ""ecstasy-only"" group was further divided into two groups of 31 current users and 58 abstinent users. The subjective sleep of current and former ecstasy-only users was compared with that of matched controls. Patients were asked to rate their sleep according to: 1) sleep quality, 2) sleep latency, 3) night time awakenings and 4) total sleep time. Current ecstasy-only users reported significantly worse sleep quality (P?<?0.05) and a greater total sleep time (P?<?0.001) than controls. It was inferred that these differences might be due to recovery from the acute effects of the drug. Abstinent ecstasy-only users reported significantly more nighttime awakenings than controls (P?<?0.01).

1829,"Reduction in social anxiety after MDMA-assisted psychotherapy with autistic adults: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study.^\nRATIONALE: Standard therapeutic approaches to reduce social anxiety in autistic adults have limited effectiveness. Since 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy shows promise as a treatment for other anxiety disorders, a blinded, placebo-controlled pilot study was conducted. OBJECTIVES: To explore feasibility and safety of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for reduction of social fear and avoidance that are common in the autistic population. METHODS: Autistic adults with marked to very severe social anxiety were randomized to receive MDMA (75 to 125 mg, n = 8) or inactive placebo (0 mg, n = 4) during two 8-h psychotherapy sessions (experimental sessions) in a controlled clinical setting. Double-blinded experimental sessions were spaced approximately 1 month apart with 3 non-drug psychotherapy sessions following each. The primary outcome was change in Leibowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) Total scores from Baseline to one month after the second experimental session. Outcomes were measured again six months after the last experimental session. RESULTS: Improvement in LSAS scores from baseline to the primary endpoint was significantly greater for MDMA group compared to the placebo group (P = 0.037), and placebo-subtracted Cohen's d effect size was very large (d = 1.4, CI - 0.074, 2.874). Change in LSAS scores from baseline to 6-month follow-up showed similar positive results (P = 0.036), with a Cohen's d effect size of 1.1 (CI - 0.307, 2.527). Social anxiety remained the same or continued to improve slightly for most participants in the MDMA group after completing the active treatment phase. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot trial demonstrated rapid and durable improvement in social anxiety symptoms in autistic adults following MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.

1958,"Repeated microdoses of LSD in healthy adults: a placebo-controlled study.^\nBackground: The resurgence of interest in therapeutic use of psychedelic drugs has raised interest in microdosing of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). There are numerous media reports that doses of LSD about 1/10th of typical tripping doses, taken at 3‐4‐ day intervals, improve mood and cognition. However, these effects have been difficult to demonstrate under placebocontrolled conditions. Methods: We conducted a double‐blind controlled study examining effects of repeated doses of LSD (13 or 26 μg) or placebo, in healthy adults. Participants were randomly assigned to receive placebo (N = 18), 13 μg LSD (N = 19), or 26 μg LSD(N = 19) during four 5‐hour laboratory sessions, separated by 3‐4 days. They also attended by a drug‐free followup session 3‐4 days after their last session. We assessed mood and subjective states, cognitive and emotional function, and cardiovascular function during the drug sessions and at followup. Results: LSD produced small increases in ratings of 'feeling a drug effect', including both stimulant‐like and LSD‐like effects, especially during the first administration of the drug. The drug produced few effects on emotion or psychomotor tasks or measures of heart rate or pressure, and no residual effects were detected on the drug‐free followup session. Conclusions: We conclude that repeated low doses of LSD are safe and that the repeated dosing design is feasible for future studies, but under these conditions the drug produces negligible changes in mood or cognition. Future studies are needed with larger sample sizes, longer duration of dosing, additional measures of cognitive or affective function, and with participants who exhibit clinical symptoms of anxiety and depression.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.02428293041884899, 0.01730101928114891, 0.005970505066215992, 0.007977564819157124, 0.0052104429341852665, 0.0058687846176326275, 0.005606191232800484, 0.004176988732069731, 0.005400114227086306, 0.010535148903727531, 0.007501185871660709, 0.00662030465900898, 0.029027234762907028, 0.9891396164894104]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]"
2358,"In vivo imaging of cerebral serotonin transporter and serotonin 2A receptor binding in 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ""Ecstasy"") and hallucinogen users.^\nContext: Both hallucinogens and 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine ( MDMA or ""ecstasy"") have direct agonistic effects on postsynaptic serotonin2A receptors, the key site for hallucinogenic actions. In addition, MDMA is a potent releaser and reuptake inhibitor of presynaptic serotonin. Objective: To assess the differential effects of MDMA and hallucinogen use on cerebral serotonin transporter (SERT) and serotonin 2A receptor binding. Design: A positron emission tomography study of 24 young adult drug users and 21 nonusing control participants performed with carbon 11 (11C)-labeled 3-amino-4-[2-[(di(methyl)amino)methyl]phenyl] sulfanylbenzonitrile (DASB) and fluorine 18 (18F)-labeled altanserin, respectively. Scans were performed in the user group after a minimum drug abstinence period of 11 days, and the group was subdivided into hallucinogen-preferring users (n=10) and MDMA-preferring users (n=14). Participants: Twenty-four young adult users ofMDMA and/or hallucinogenic drugs and 21 nonusing controls. Main Outcome Measures: In vivo cerebral SERT and serotonin2A receptor binding. Results: Compared with nonusers, MDMA-preferring users showed significant decreases in SERT nondisplaceable binding potential (neocortex, -56%; pallidostriatum, -19%; and amygdala, -32%); no significant changes were seen in hallucinogen-preferring users. Both cortical and pallidostriatal SERT nondisplaceable binding potential was negatively correlated with the number of lifetime MDMA exposures, and the time of abstinence from MDMA was positively correlated with subcortical, but not cortical, SERT binding. A small decrease in neocortical serotonin2A receptor binding in the serotonin2A receptor agonist users (both user groups) was also detected. Conclusions: We found evidence that MDMA but not hallucinogen use is associated with changes in the cerebral presynaptic serotonergic transmitter system. Because hallucinogenic drugs primarily have serotonin2A receptor agonistic actions, we conclude that the negative association between MDMA use and cerebral SERT binding is mediated through a direct presynaptic MDMA effect rather than by the serotonin2A agonistic effects of MDMA. Our cross-sectional data suggest that subcortical, but not cortical, recovery of SERT binding might take place after several months of MDMA abstinence. ©2011 American Medical Association.

6954,"Adjunct Ketamine Use in the Management of Severe Ethanol Withdrawal.^\nOBJECTIVES: Ketamine offers a plausible mechanism with favorable kinetics in treatment of severe ethanol withdrawal. The purpose of this study is to determine if a treatment guideline using an adjunctive ketamine infusion improves outcomes in patients suffering from severe ethanol withdrawal. DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study. SETTING: Academic tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS: Patients admitted to the ICU and diagnosed with delirium tremens by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders V criteria. INTERVENTIONS: Pre and post guideline, all patients were treated in a symptom-triggered fashion with benzodiazepines and/or phenobarbital. Postguideline, standard symptom-triggered dosing continued as preguideline, plus, the patient was initiated on an IV ketamine infusion at 0.15-0.3 mg/kg/hr continuously until delirium resolved. Based upon withdrawal severity and degree of agitation, a ketamine bolus (0.3 mg/kg) was provided prior to continuous infusion in some patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 63 patients were included (29 preguideline; 34 postguideline). Patients treated with ketamine were less likely to be intubated (odds ratio, 0.14; p < 0.01; 95% CI, 0.04-0.49) and had a decreased ICU stay by 2.83 days (95% CI, -5.58 to -0.089; p = 0.043). For ICU days outcome, correlation coefficients were significant for alcohol level and total benzodiazepine dosing. For hospital days outcome, correlation coefficients were significant for patient age, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase level. Regression revealed the use of ketamine was associated with a nonsignificant decrease in hospital stay by 3.66 days (95% CI, -8.40 to 1.08; p = 0.13). CONCLUSIONS: Mechanistically, adjunctive therapy with ketamine may attenuate the demonstrated neuroexcitatory contribution of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor stimulation in severe ethanol withdrawal, reduce the need for excessive gamma-aminobutyric acid agonist mediated-sedation, and limit associated morbidity. A ketamine infusion in patients with delirium tremens was associated with reduced gamma-aminobutyric acid agonist requirements, shorter ICU length of stay, lower likelihood of intubation, and a trend toward a shorter hospitalization.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.8658174276351929, 0.129971444606781, 0.007248925510793924, 0.008605037815868855, 0.12650199234485626, 0.05267779156565666, 0.006631405558437109, 0.009134446270763874, 0.009406211785972118, 0.020638754591345787, 0.013612029142677784, 0.010309448465704918, 0.041398994624614716, 0.15339680016040802]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
7097,"An exploration of actigraphy in the context of ketamine and treatment‐resistant depression.^\nObjectives This study explored the potential of non‐parametric and complexity analysis metrics to detect changes in activity post‐ketamine and their association with depressive symptomatology. Methods Individuals with treatment‐resistant depression (TRD: n = 27, 16F, 35.9 ± 10.8 years) and healthy volunteers (HVs: n = 9, 4F, 36.4 ± 9.59 years) had their activity monitored during an inpatient, double‐blind, crossover study where they received an infusion of ketamine or saline placebo. All participants were 18–65 years old, medication‐free, and had a MADRS score ≥20. Non‐parametric metrics averaged over each study day, metrics derived from complexity analysis, and traditionally calculated non‐parametric metrics averaged over two weeks were calculated from the actigraphy time series. A separate analysis was conducted for a subsample (n = 17) to assess the utility of these metrics in a hospital setting. Results In HVs, lower intradaily variability was observed within daily rest/activity patterns post‐ketamine versus post‐placebo (F = 5.16(1,15), p = 0.04). No other significant effects of drug or drug‐by‐time or correlations between depressive symptomatology and activity were detected.

687,"Effects of perioperative intravenous low dose of ketamine on postoperative analgesia in children.^\nBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Low dose of ketamine reduces postoperative pain and opioid consumption in adult studies. However, there are only a few data with controversial results in the paediatric population. The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the use of low doses of intravenous ketamine on postoperative pain in children after surgery on the lower part of the body. METHODS: Thirty-seven children with ASA 1 or 2 from 6 to 60 months of age, undergoing scheduled surgery, were prospectively enrolled in a double blind sequential trial using a triangular test, with analysis every 10 patients treated. The children were randomly assigned to intravenously receive saline or 0.15 mg kg(-1) ketamine before surgery, followed by a continuous infusion of 1.4 microg kg(-1) min(-1) over 24 h. After sevoflurane induction and tracheal intubation, a caudal anaesthesia was performed in all children (1 ml kg(-1) of bupivacaine 0.25% with epinephrine). The postoperative analgesic technique was standardized with intravenous paracetamol 15 mg kg(-1) 6 h(-1), rectal morniflumate (20 mg kg(-1) 12 h(-1)) and intravenous nalbuphine infusion 1.2 mg kg(-1) 24 h(-1) for 24 h. The Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS) scores, additional bolus of nalbuphine (if CHEOPS >7) and side effects were recorded from eye opening every 2 h over 24 h. The primary endpoint was the CHEOPS area under the curve. RESULTS: There was no difference in terms of additional bolus of nalbuphine as well as CHEOPS score area under the curve between groups, that is, 76 +/- 10 in the ketamine group versus 74 +/- 7 in the control group. No psychomimetic side effects were noted. CONCLUSION: The study failed to show any evidence of benefit of ketamine to improve analgesia in children when given in addition to a multimodal analgesic therapy with paracetamol, a NSAID and an opiate.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0951140820980072, 0.039234548807144165, 0.03021637536585331, 0.022637221962213516, 0.01645238883793354, 0.025971604511141777, 0.017150847241282463, 0.011772760190069675, 0.019531041383743286, 0.029651466757059097, 0.7698671817779541, 0.0248994342982769, 0.05080657824873924, 0.20057973265647888]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
5679,"Variation of drugs involved in acute drug toxicity presentations based on age and sex: an epidemiological approach based on European emergency departments.^\nOBJECTIVE: To analyse the relative percentage of acute recreational drug toxicity emergency department (ED) presentations involving the main drug groups according to age and sex and investigate different patterns based on sex and age strata. METHODS: We analysed all patients with acute recreational drug toxicity included by the Euro-DEN Plus dataset (22 EDs in 14 European countries) between October 2013 and December 2016 (39 months). Drugs were grouped as: opioids, cocaine, cannabis, amphetamines, gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), hallucinogens, new psychoactive substances (NPS), benzodiazepines and ketamine. Descriptive data by age and sex are presented and compared among age/sex categories and among drug families. RESULTS: Of 17,371 patients were included during the 39-month period, 17,198 (99.0%) had taken at least one of the investigated drugs (median age: 31 years; 23.9% female; ethanol co-ingestion recorded in 41.5%, unknown in 31.2%; multiple drug use in 37.9%). Opioids (in 31.4% of patients) and amphetamines (23.3%) were the most frequently involved and hallucinogens (1.9%) and ketamine (1.7%) the least. Overall, female patients were younger than males, both in the whole cohort (median age 29 vs. 32 years; p < 0.001) and in all drug groups except benzodiazepines (median age 36 vs. 36 years; p = 0.83). The relative proportion of each drug group was different at every age strata and some patterns could be clearly described: cannabis, NPS and hallucinogens were the most common in patients <20 years; amphetamines, ketamine and cocaine in the 20- to 39-year group; GHB/GBL in the 30- to 39-year group; and opioids and benzodiazepines in patients ≥40 years. Ethanol and other drug co-ingestion was more frequent at middle-ages, and multidrug co-ingestion was more common in females than males.

691,"Predicting therapeutic response to oral ketamine for chronic suicidal ideation: a Bayesian network for clinical decision support.^\nBACKGROUND: The glutamatergic modulator ketamine has been shown to result in rapid reductions in both suicidal ideation (SI) and depressive symptoms in clinical trials. There is a practical need for identification of pre-treatment predictors of ketamine response. Previous studies indicate links between treatment response and body mass index (BMI), depression symptoms and previous suicide attempts. Our aim was to explore the use of clinical and demographic factors to predict response to serial doses of oral ketamine for chronic suicidal ideation. METHODS: Thirty-two participants completed the Oral Ketamine Trial on Suicidality (OKTOS). Data for the current study were drawn from pre-treatment and follow-up time-points of OKTOS. Only clinical and sociodemographic variables were included in this analysis. Data were used to create a proof of concept Bayesian network (BN) model of variables predicting prolonged response to oral ketamine, as defined by the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS). RESULTS: The network of potential predictors of response was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. A combination of nine demographic and clinical variables predicted prolonged ketamine response, with strong contributions from BMI, Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), number of suicide attempts, employment status and age. We evaluated and optimised the proposed network to increase the area under the ROC curve (AUC). The performance evaluation demonstrated that the BN predicted prolonged ketamine response with 97% accuracy, and AUC = 0.87. CONCLUSIONS: At present, validated tools to facilitate risk assessment are infrequently used in psychiatric practice. Pre-treatment assessment of individuals' likelihood of response to oral ketamine for chronic suicidal ideation could be beneficial in making more informed decisions about likelihood of success for this treatment course.

Thirty adults with chronic suicidality participated in the trial over 10 weeks. Functional recovery and wellbeing were assessed using the Social and Occupational Functioning Scale (SOFAS) and World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5). Suicidality and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Beck Scale for Suicidal ideation (BSS) and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Relationships between the four treatment outcomes were analysed. Forty-three percent of participants achieved healthy function (SOFAS ≥ 80) and 27% reported healthy wellbeing (WHO-5 > 60%) at the four-week post-treatment follow-up. Wellbeing was revealed as the data-derived treatment endpoint for the sample. Effect sizes for functioning and wellbeing outcomes were smaller than for suicidality and depression outcomes.

1264,"Trial of Psilocybin versus Escitalopram for Depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Psilocybin may have antidepressant properties, but direct comparisons between psilocybin and established treatments for depression are lacking. METHODS: In a phase 2, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial involving patients with long-standing, moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder, we compared psilocybin with escitalopram, a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor, over a 6-week period. Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two separate doses of 25 mg of psilocybin 3 weeks apart plus 6 weeks of daily placebo (psilocybin group) or two separate doses of 1 mg of psilocybin 3 weeks apart plus 6 weeks of daily oral escitalopram (escitalopram group); all the patients received psychological support. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in the score on the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS-SR-16; scores range from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating greater depression) at week 6. There were 16 secondary outcomes, including QIDS-SR-16 response (defined as a reduction in score of >50%) and QIDS-SR-16 remission (defined as a score of ≤5) at week 6. RESULTS: A total of 59 patients were enrolled; 30 were assigned to the psilocybin group and 29 to the escitalopram group. The mean scores on the QIDS-SR-16 at baseline were 14.5 in the psilocybin group and 16.4 in the escitalopram group. The mean (±SE) changes in the scores from baseline to week 6 were -8.0±1.0 points in the psilocybin group and -6.0±1.0 in the escitalopram group, for a between-group difference of 2.0 points (95% confidence interval [CI], -5.0 to 0.9) (P = 0.17). A QIDS-SR-16 response occurred in 70% of the patients in the psilocybin group and in 48% of those in the escitalopram group, for a between-group difference of 22 percentage points (95% CI, -3 to 48); QIDS-SR-16 remission occurred in 57% and 28%, respectively, for a between-group difference of 28 percentage points (95% CI, 2 to 54). Other secondary outcomes generally favored psilocybin over escitalopram, but the analyses were not corrected for multiple comparisons. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the trial groups. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the change in depression scores on the QIDS-SR-16 at week 6, this trial did not show a significant difference in antidepressant effects between psilocybin and escitalopram in a selected group of patients. Secondary outcomes generally favored psilocybin over escitalopram, but the analyses of these outcomes lacked correction for multiple comparisons. Larger and longer trials are required to compare psilocybin with established antidepressants.

The antisuicidal effect did not differ between the ketamine treatment groups. Two ketamine infusions increased TNF-α levels compared with a single ketamine or placebo infusion (p = 0.015). A single ketamine infusion improved the TNF-α-to-IL-2 ratio, an index of average anti-inflammatory effect, than two ketamine infusions or a single placebo infusion (p = 0.027). DISCUSSION: Repeated low-dose ketamine infusions improved the antidepressant effect, but not the antisuicidal effect, compared with a single infusion. However, repeated ketamine infusions may exert a lesser anti-inflammatory effect than a single infusion.","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.9840371608734131, 0.9887809753417969, 0.01794523000717163, 0.009970598854124546, 0.011252356693148613, 0.0110162403434515, 0.008958430029451847, 0.007987654767930508, 0.006830289028584957, 0.011612650007009506, 0.010894792154431343, 0.012575412169098854, 0.01231639739125967, 0.042106810957193375]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

Further study is needed to understand whether these treatments are effective for Veteran populations.Objectives: Here, we examine the effectiveness of psychedelic-assisted therapy among trauma-exposed Special Operations Forces Veterans (SOFV) seeking treatment for cognitive and mental health problems in Mexico.Methods: Data were collected from an ibogaine and 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) clinical treatment program for SOFV with a history of trauma exposure. This clinical program collects prospective clinical program evaluation data, such as background characteristics, symptom severity, functioning (e.g., satisfaction with life, posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, sleep disturbance, psychological flexibility, disability in functioning, cognitive functioning, neurobehavioral symptoms, anger, suicidal ideation), and substance persisting/enduring effects through online surveys at four timepoints (baseline/pre-treatment, one-, three-, and six-months after treatment).Results: The majority of the sample (n = 86; Mean Age = 42.88, SD = 7.88) were Caucasian (87.2%), non-Hispanic (89.5%), and males (100%). There were significant and large improvements in self-reported PTSD symptoms (p < .001, d = .414), depression (p < .001, d = .275), anxiety (p < .001, d = .276), insomnia severity (p < .001, d = .351), and post-concussive symptoms (p < .001, d = .389) as well as self-reported satisfaction with life (p < .001, d = .371), psychological flexibility (p < .001, d = .313) and cognitive functioning (p < .001, d = .265) from baseline to one-month follow-up.Conclusions: Data suggest combined ibogaine and 5-MeO-DMT assisted therapy has potential to provide rapid and robust changes in mental health functioning with a signal of durable therapeutic effects up to 6-months.

2048,"Investigating the role of serotonin in visual orientation processing using an 'ecstasy' (MDMA)-based research model.^\nAims/Objectives:A growing body of evidence suggests that regular 'ecstasy' (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) use causes lasting changes to central serotonergic functioning in humans, including in the occipital lobe. Serotonin may play a role in visual orientation processing, mediated in the occipital lobe, via lateral inhibition. The tilt aftereffect is an illusion apparent following adaptation to stimuli angled 5-50° from vertical and thought to be affected by lateral inhibition between occipital neurons. A recent study identified an enhanced tilt aftereffect among ecstasy users, but only in a subset that were recently abstinent from amphetamines. The current study examined the effects of ecstasy use, cannabis use and their interacting effect on the magnitude of the tilt aftereffect among participants with no recent history of amphetamine consumption. Materials and Methods: Eleven ecstasy users, 15 cannabis users, 15 ecstasy plus cannabis users and 15 drug-naïve controls were compared on the magnitude of the tilt aftereffect elicited following adaptation to stimuli angled 15, 30, 40 or 60° from vertical. Results:At a 40° adaptation condition, ecstasy users had a greater magnitude of the tilt aftereffect compared to those that had not taken the drug. Additionally, the extent of ecstasy use was positively associated with the magnitude of the tilt aftereffect generated following 15, 30 and 40° adaptation conditions, but not at 60°. Conclusions:Given that lateral inhibition mediates the tilt aftereffect following adaptation to 5-50°, the findings of a relationship between ecstasy use and tilt magnitude at the 15-40° but not 60° adaptation conditions support a role for serotonin in visual orientation processing via lateral inhibition.

2915,"Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial of Titrated Subcutaneous Ketamine in Older Patients with Treatment-Resistant Depression.^\nOBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous ketamine for geriatric treatment-resistant depression. Secondary aims were to examine if repeated treatments were safe and more effective in inducing or prolonging remission than a single treatment. METHODS: In this double-blind, controlled, multiple-crossover study with a 6-month follow-up (randomized controlled trial [RCT] phase), 16 participants (≥60 years) with treatment-resistant depression who relapsed after remission or did not remit in the RCT were administered an open-label phase. Up to five subcutaneous doses of ketamine (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 mg/kg) were administered in separate sessions (≥1 week apart), with one active control (midazolam) randomly inserted (RCT phase). Twelve ketamine treatments were given in the open-label phase. Mood, hemodynamic, and psychotomimetic outcomes were assessed by blinded raters. Remitters in each phase were followed for 6 months. RESULTS: Seven of 14 RCT-phase completers remitted with ketamine treatment. Five remitted at doses below 0.5 mg/kg. Doses ≥ 0.2 mg/kg were significantly more effective than midazolam. Ketamine was well tolerated. Repeated treatments resulted in higher likelihood of remission or longer time to relapse. CONCLUSION: Results provide preliminary evidence for the efficacy and safety of ketamine in treating elderly depressed. Dose titration is recommended for optimizing antidepressant and safety outcomes on an individual basis. Subcutaneous injection is a practical method for giving ketamine.

3592,"The rapid anti-suicidal ideation effect of ketamine: A systematic review.^\nIn many countries suicide rates have been trending upwards for close to twenty years-presenting a public health crisis. Most suicide attempts and deaths are associated with psychiatric illness, usually a depressive disorder. Subanesthetic ketamine is the only FDA-approved antidepressant that works in hours not weeks-thus potentially transforming treatment of suicidal patients. We reviewed all randomized controlled trials of the effect of ketamine on suicidal ideation to determine if ketamine rapidly reduces suicidal ideation [SI] in depressed patients and how long the benefit persists after one dose and if the route of administration or dose affects the outcome. A systematic review was conducted as per PRISMA [preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses] criteria. PubMed search inclusive of ""ketamine"" and ""suicide"" yielded 358 results. Papers (N = 354) were then read by at least two authors, identifying 12 meeting eligibility requirements and eleven RCTs examining whether ketamine treatment ameliorated SI. Four of five RCTs examined racemic ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) given intravenously and found an advantage for ketamine over control for rapid reduction in SI in acutely depressed patients. Two studies examined intranasal esketamine in depressed suicidal patients and found no advantage over saline. One study examined outcome six weeks after a single intravenous dose of ketamine and found benefit for SI sustained relative to 24 h post-dose. Further research is warranted into: optimal dosing strategy, including number and frequency; and long-term efficacy and safety. Ultimately, it remains to be shown that ketamine's benefit for SI translates into prevention of suicidal behavior.","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.9898688793182373, 0.9892922639846802, 0.023087840527296066, 0.011094968765974045, 0.014782574027776718, 0.013173220679163933, 0.009527320973575115, 0.008929995819926262, 0.007182126399129629, 0.011503137648105621, 0.010073264129459858, 0.015413460321724415, 0.010667039081454277, 0.02832736074924469]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
4049,"Discriminative stimulus effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in humans trained to discriminate among d-amphetamine, meta-chlorophenylpiperazine and placebo.^\nIn animals, two-choice drug discrimination studies have demonstrated that the behavioral effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) are mediated by dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. In order to delineate the relative role of these systems, three-choice paradigms have been used in animals, with findings indicating a more prominent role for serotonin. Human studies assessing the subjective and physiological effects of MDMA have also indicated a mixed action. To parallel animal studies, the participants in the present study were trained to discriminate among a prototypic dopaminergic agonist, d-amphetamine, a prototypic serotonergic agonist, meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) and placebo and then were tested with two doses of MDMA. In addition, subjective and physiological effects were measured. The results demonstrated that humans could be trained to discriminate among 20 mg d-amphetamine, 0.75 mg/kg mCPP and placebo. When tested with 1.0 and 1.5 mg/kg, half the participants reported MDMA to be like amphetamine and half like mCPP. There were no clear differences between these two groups in other dimensions, although there was an indication that the individuals who discriminated MDMA as d-amphetamine were more sensitive to the effects of all the drugs.

4558,"Ketamine psychotherapy for heroin addiction: immediate effects and two-year follow-up.^\nSeventy detoxified heroin-addicted patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups receiving ketamine psychotherapy (KPT) involving two different doses of ketamine. The patients of the experimental group received existentially oriented psychotherapy in combination with a hallucinogenic (""psychedelic"") dose of ketamine (2.0 mg/kg im). The patients of the control group received the same psychotherapy combined with a low, non-hallucinogenic (non-psychedelic), dose of ketamine (0.2 mg/kg im). Both the psychotherapist and patient were blind to the dose of ketamine. The therapy included preparation for the ketamine session, the ketamine session itself, and the post session psychotherapy aimed to help patients to integrate insights from their ketamine session into everyday life. The results of this double blind randomized clinical trial of KPT for heroin addiction showed that high dose (2.0 mg/kg) KPT elicits a full psychedelic experience in heroin addicts as assessed quantitatively by the Hallucinogen Rating Scale. On the other hand, low dose KPT (0.2 mg/kg) elicits ""sub-psychedelic"" experiences and functions as ketamine-facilitated guided imagery. High dose KPT produced a significantly greater rate of abstinence in heroin addicts within the first two years of follow-up, a greater and longer-lasting reduction in craving for heroin, as well as greater positive change in nonverbal unconscious emotional attitudes than did low dose KPT.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.8927785754203796, 0.05107000097632408, 0.02229289896786213, 0.04555832967162132, 0.05012521147727966, 0.5640720725059509, 0.01643580012023449, 0.01626831665635109, 0.013259773142635822, 0.06990846246480942, 0.05665118992328644, 0.019671250134706497, 0.079470194876194, 0.08048547804355621]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
4578,"Interactive effects of subanesthetic ketamine and subhypnotic lorazepam in humans.^\nKetamine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist with psychotogenic and dissociative effects in healthy humans. These cognitive and perceptual effects in humans are reportedly reduced by benzodiazepine premedication. This study assessed the interactive effects of a ketamine (i.v. bolus of 0.26 mg/kg followed by an infusion of 0.65 mg/kg per hour) and lorazepam 2 mg., PO, in humans. Twenty-three healthy subjects completed 4 test days involving the oral administration of lorazepam or matched placebo 2 h prior to the i.v. infusion of ketamine or placebo. Ketamine: 1) produced behaviors similar to the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia as assessed by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS); 2) evoked perceptual alterations as measured by the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS); 3) impaired performance on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) and other tests sensitive to frontal cortical impairment; and 4) had amnestic effects. Lorazepam produced attention impairments, concrete proverb interpretations, and recall impairments. Lorazepam reduced ketamine-associated emotional distress and there was a non-significant trend for it to decrease perceptual alterations produced by ketamine. However, it failed to reduce many cognitive and behavioral effects of ketamine, including psychosis. Further, lorazepam exacerbated the sedative, attention-impairing, and amnestic effects of ketamine. There was no evidence of pharmacokinetic interaction between these medications. These data suggest that subhypnotic lorazepam and ketamine show a spectrum of interactive effects, ranging from antagonism to potentiation.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.02551768720149994, 0.017129182815551758, 0.005654015578329563, 0.007827959954738617, 0.004711578134447336, 0.0058835530653595924, 0.005392986349761486, 0.004288825206458569, 0.005135375075042248, 0.010498295538127422, 0.008043788373470306, 0.006219396833330393, 0.025477729737758636, 0.9883727431297302]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]"
4893,"Comparative acute effects of mescaline, lysergic acid diethylamide, and psilocybin in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study in healthy participants.^\nMescaline, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and psilocybin are classic serotonergic psychedelics. A valid, direct comparison of the effects of these substances is lacking. The main goal of the present study was to investigate potential pharmacological, physiological and phenomenological differences at psychoactive-equivalent doses of mescaline, LSD, and psilocybin. The present study used a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design to compare the acute subjective effects, autonomic effects, and pharmacokinetics of typically used, moderate to high doses of mescaline (300 and 500 mg), LSD (100 µg), and psilocybin (20 mg) in 32 healthy participants. A mescaline dose of 300 mg was used in the first 16 participants and 500 mg was used in the subsequent 16 participants. Acute subjective effects of 500 mg mescaline, LSD, and psilocybin were comparable across various psychometric scales. Autonomic effects of 500 mg mescaline, LSD, and psilocybin were moderate, with psilocybin causing a higher increase in diastolic blood pressure compared with LSD, and LSD showing a trend toward an increase in heart rate compared with psilocybin. The tolerability of mescaline, LSD, and psilocybin was comparable, with mescaline at both doses inducing slightly more subacute adverse effects (12-24 h) than LSD and psilocybin. Clear distinctions were seen in the duration of action between the three substances. Mescaline had the longest effect duration (mean: 11.1 h), followed by LSD (mean: 8.2 h), and psilocybin (mean: 4.9 h). Plasma elimination half-lives of mescaline and LSD were similar (approximately 3.5 h). The longer effect duration of mescaline compared with LSD was due to the longer time to reach maximal plasma concentrations and related peak effects. Mescaline and LSD, but not psilocybin, enhanced circulating oxytocin. None of the substances altered plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor concentrations. In conclusion, the present study found no evidence of qualitative differences in altered states of consciousness that were induced by equally strong doses of mescaline, LSD, and psilocybin. The results indicate that any differences in the pharmacological profiles of mescaline, LSD, and psilocybin do not translate into relevant differences in the subjective experience.

5828,"Effect of intranasal esketamine on cognitive functioning in healthy participants: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.^\nBACKGROUND: The effect of intranasal esketamine on cognitive functioning in healthy participants is assessed in this study. METHODS: Twenty-four participants (19-49 years) were randomized to one of two treatment sequences in which either esketamine 84 mg or placebo was intranasally administered in a double-blind, two-period crossover design. Primary measures included five tests of Cogstate(®) computerized test battery assessed at 1 h predose and 40 min, 2, 4, and 6 h postdose. Secondary measures included the Mental Effort Scale, Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), and safety. RESULTS: Esketamine was associated with significant cognitive performance impairment at 40 min postdose for all five Cogstate® tests (Detection p = 0.0011, Identification p = 0.0006, One-Card Learning p = 0.0040, One Back p = 0.0017, and Groton Maze Learning Test p < 0.0001) versus placebo. In contrast, performance on these tests did not differ significantly between esketamine and placebo at 2, 4, or 6 h postdose. Secondary outcomes indicated a significant, transient increase from baseline under esketamine versus placebo at 40 min postdose on the Mental Effort Scale and at 40 min and 2 h postdose on KSS (p < 0.0001 for both); however, no significant difference was observed on these outcomes between esketamine and placebo at later timepoints. The most commonly reported adverse events were dizziness (67%), nausea (37.5%), disturbance in attention (29.2%), and fatigue (29.2%); the majority were considered mild in severity. CONCLUSIONS: Esketamine was associated with cognitive performance decline, and greater effort was required to complete the test battery versus placebo at 40 min postdose, which returned to placebo-comparable levels by 2 h postdose.

6058,"UW Psilocybin Pharmacokinetics Study.^\nThe primary objective of this clinical trial is to determine the pharmacokinetics of an extemporaneous oral formulation of psilocybin in normal, healthy adults. This study is intended to add to the existing body of modern clinical research on psilocybin to support future multi‐institutional Phase III clinical trials seeking to decrease anxiety and depression in patients with incurable cancer. The long‐term goal of this research is to submit a successful new drug application for psilocybin to the FDA. Subjects will initially take one 0.3 mg/kg (approximately 20mg/70kg) oral dose of psilocybin to initiate an eight hour chaperoned outpatient experience. After eight hours of outpatient sampling, the subject will be transported across the street to the UW Institute for Clinical and Translational Research Clinical Research Unit (ICTR CRU) for an overnight stay and additional blood and urine sampling. Pre‐ and post‐treatment psychologic preparation and debriefing interviews will be required. A minimum of four weeks after the first dose, the subject will receive a second oral dose of psilocybin at the higher dose of 0.45 mg/kg (approximately 30 mg/70 kg). This dosing will again take place in an attended, structured setting with timed blood and urine samples obtained both in the School of Pharmacy (0‐8 hours) and in the UW Clinical Research Unit (8‐24 hours). A minimum of four weeks after the second dose, the subject will receive a third oral dose of psilocybin at the highest dose of 0.6 mg/kg (approximately 40 mg/70 kg).

6643,"The effects of psilocybin on brain EEG activity and connectivity in healthy volunteers-focus on the dynamics of the psychedelic state.^\nIntroduction.‐ A serotonin 5‐HT2A/C agonist, psychedelic drug psilocybin, is gaining attention as a potential therapeutic tool for anxiety and depression. Psilocybin induces desynchronization of the EEG during the peak of its effects, continuous data are lacking. Objectives.‐ We focused on the dynamics of changes in neuropsychological parameters, brain activity and connectivity after oral administration of psilocybin. Methods.‐ Twenty healthy volunteers (10 M/10F, 28‐50yrs) were enrolled in this placebo controlled cross over double blind trial. A standard 19 channel EEG (registered before and 60, 90, 180 and 360 min after psilocybin (0.26 mg/kg) ingestion), brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS), plasma levels of psilocin were collected several times over the session, a subjective scale “altered scale of consciousness scale (ASCs)” at the end of measurements. Current source density and connectivity were analysed by Low Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA). Results.‐ Psilocybin induced psychotic‐like symptoms, especially changes in perception and thought disturbances, peaking at 90 min after ingestion along with serum psilocin levels. Induced global decrease of the alpha current source density in the occipital cortex was negatively correlated with the intensity of effects. The overall connectivity decreased in the alpha band, but increased in all other frequency bands at peak, however, six hours after ingestion, the effects were inverted. Conclusions.‐ The study shows that psilocybin dynamically shifts the brain from one connectivity state at baseline through a peak effect to reach another global connectivity state at the end.

7890,"Psychochemotherapy.^\nThis paper describes the results of a clinical study exploring the potential of a complex program of psychedelic therapy to alleviate the emotional and physical suffering of terminal cancer patients. A total of 50 cancer patients participated in this experimental treatment program, in which two psychedelic compounds were used as an adjunct to a brief course of intensive psychotherapy. In 40 of of these patients LSD was used perorally in dosages from 200 to 500 mcg, in 7 of these patients dipropyltryptamine (DPT) was administered intramuscularly in doses ranging from 60 to 105 mg. These patients received both LSD and DPT on different occasions. The therapeutic results were assessed by means of a clinical rating scale reflecting the degree of the patient's depression, psychological isolation, anxiety, difficulty in management, acceptance of imminent death, fear of death and pain. The ratings were made by attending physicians, nurses, family members, LSD therapists and co therapists. In addition, the amount of physical pain and/or pain tolerance was assessed on the basis of the amount of narcotics required in the management of the patient. The comparison of the means of individual ratings from pre to post treatment showed significant improvement in all the measured parameters for most of the raters. There was a definite trend toward reduction of the narcotic medication; it did not, however, reach the level of statistical significance. The pre to post treatment comparison of the Global Indexes grossly expressing the degree of emotional and physical distress indicated that approximately 36% of the patients were dramatically improved, 36% moderately improved and 19% essentially unchanged. In 8% of the patients Global Indexes showed a decrement following psychedelic therapy.

8271,"Impact of Cytochrome P450 2D6 Function on the Chiral Blood Plasma Pharmacokinetics of 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and Its Phase I and II Metabolites in Humans.^\n3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy) metabolism is known to be stereoselective, with preference for S-stereoisomers. Its major metabolic step involves CYP2D6-catalyzed demethylenation to 3,4-dihydroxymethamphetamine (DHMA), followed by methylation and conjugation. Alterations in CYP2D6 genotype and/or phenotype have been associated with higher toxicity. Therefore, the impact of CYP2D6 function on the plasma pharmacokinetics of MDMA and its phase I and II metabolites was tested by comparing extensive metabolizers (EMs), intermediate metabolizers (IMs), and EMs that were pretreated with bupropion as a metabolic inhibitor in a controlled MDMA administration study. Blood plasma samples were collected from 16 healthy participants (13 EMs and three IMs) up to 24 h after MDMA administration in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-period, cross-over design, with subjects receiving 1 week placebo or bupropion pretreatment followed by a single placebo or MDMA (125 mg) dose. Bupropion pretreatment increased the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC24) of R-MDMA (9% and 25%, respectively) and S-MDMA (16% and 38%, respectively). Bupropion reduced the Cmax and AUC24 of the CYP2D6-dependently formed metabolite stereoisomers of DHMA 3-sulfate, DHMA 4-sulfate, and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine (HMMA sulfate and HMMA glucuronide) by approximately 40%. The changes that were observed in IMs were generally comparable to bupropion-pretreated EMs. Although changes in stereoselectivity based on CYP2D6 activity were observed, these likely have low clinical relevance. Bupropion and hydroxybupropion stereoisomer pharmacokinetics were unaltered by MDMA co-administration. The present data might aid further interpretations of toxicity based on CYP2D6-dependent MDMA metabolism.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.022810110822319984, 0.014993775635957718, 0.004988455213606358, 0.0072677163407206535, 0.00439665699377656, 0.006303378380835056, 0.005303479265421629, 0.004172559827566147, 0.004806102253496647, 0.011237920261919498, 0.0072767180390655994, 0.005708686076104641, 0.0438922680914402, 0.989739716053009]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]"

170,"Evidence of neurotoxicity of ecstasy: Sustained effects on electroencephalographic activity in polydrug users.^\nObjective: According to previous EEG reports of indicative disturbances in Alpha and Beta activities, a systematic search for distinct EEG abnormalities in a broader population of Ecstasy users may especially corroborate the presumed specific neurotoxicity of Ecstasy in humans. Methods: 105 poly-drug consumers with former Ecstasy use and 41 persons with comparable drug history without Ecstasy use, and 11 drug naives were investigated for EEG features. Conventional EEG derivations of 19 electrodes according to the 10-20-system were conducted. Besides standard EEG bands, quantitative EEG analyses of 1-Hz-subdivided power ranges of Alpha, Theta and Beta bands have been considered. Results: Ecstasy users with medium and high cumulative Ecstasy doses revealed an increase in Theta and lower Alpha activities, significant increases in Beta activities, and a reduction of background activity. Ecstasy users with low cumulative Ecstasy doses showed a significant Alpha activity at 11 Hz. Interestingly, the spectral power of low frequencies in medium and high Ecstasy users was already significantly increased in the early phase of EEG recording. Statistical analyses suggested the main effect of Ecstasy to EEG results. Conclusions: Our data from a major sample of Ecstasy users support previous data revealing alterations of EEG frequency spectrum due rather to neurotoxic effects of Ecstasy on serotonergic systems in more detail. Accordingly, our data may be in line with the observation of attentional and memory impairments in Ecstasy users with moderate to high misuse. Despite the methodological problem of polydrug use also in our approach, our EEG results may be indicative of the neuropathophysiological background of the reported memory and attentional deficits in Ecstasy abusers. Overall, our findings may suggest the usefulness of EEG in diagnostic approaches in assessing neurotoxic sequela of this common drug abuse. © 2010 Adamaszek et al.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0]","[0.03807786852121353, 0.0137051185593009, 0.01635054685175419, 0.017323952168226242, 0.018955500796437263, 0.055802538990974426, 0.024778367951512337, 0.026883428916335106, 0.02124081924557686, 0.42588192224502563, 0.03085603564977646, 0.013988735154271126, 0.975030779838562, 0.9558858871459961]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0]"
319,"Psilocybin-assisted treatment for alcohol use disorder: a clinical perspective.^\nBackground: Hallucinogenic compounds such as psilocybin have reemerged as promising adjunctive treatments for alcohol use disorder. A recent open‐label study of psilocybin with 12 weeks of psychosocial treatment for alcohol use disorder showed a significant acute reduction in the percentage of heavy drinking days, post‐psilocybin administration for 36 weeks (Bogenschutz, 2015). Furthermore, the study showed that psilocybin‐assisted treatment was safe, feasible, and tolerable. The methods and outcomes of that study were foundational in the design of this current investigation which is an ongoing double‐blind active controlled clinical trial of psilocybin‐assisted treatment for alcohol use disorder (target enrollment, n = 180). Methods: Patients with alcohol use disorder were assigned to either receive orally administered psilocybin or diphenhydramine in two or three sessions in addition to Motivational Enhancement and Taking Action (META) therapy and therapy sessions devoted to preparation for and debriefing from the psilocybin sessions. Total treatment course was 42 weeks. Three patients who completed treatment in the trial were selected to represent the variety of experiences and outcomes observed, not as evidence of efficacy. Treatment assignment has not been un‐blinded. Results: All three patients had a reduction in heavy drinking behavior. Two of the three patients were abstinent by the end of the trial. One of the three patients declined medication after his first session. Experiences were intense and memorable in ways that were unique to each patient. Conclusions: Although we do not know if psilocybin played a role in any of the study patients' treatment, the treatment course in its entirety was a memorable experience that appeared to have a positive impact on change in drinking behavior. These outcomes provide us with valuable information about the processes through which patients may or may not benefit from this type of treatment. Summary: This study examined psilocybin as a potential adjunctive therapy for patients with alcohol use disorder. Three patients from our ongoing double‐blind activecontrolled clinical trial were selected to represent the variety of experiences and outcomes observed, not as evidence of efficacy. Although we do not know if psilocybin played a role in any of the study patients' treatment, the treatment course in its entirety was a memorable experience that appeared to have a positive impact on change in drinking behavior. These outcomes provide us with valuable information about the processes through which patients may or may not benefit from this type of treatment.

We used an online questionnaire to document the symptoms and relationship to drug use of unusual visual phenomena in hallucinogen users. 16,192 individuals viewed the information sheet and 2679 were included in the study. Of these, 224 reported having unrelated diagnoses associated with unusual visual experiences and were excluded from main analyses. Most (60.6%) of the remaining 2455 participants reported having experienced drug-free visual experiences that resembled hallucinogen effects. Probability of experiencing constant or near-constant symptoms was predicted by greater past exposure to specific hallucinogens, including lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Although symptoms were common, few (104, or 4.2% of the sample) found them distressing or impairing enough to consider seeking treatment.

1255,"Double-blind comparison of the two hallucinogens psilocybin and dextromethorphan: similarities and differences in subjective experiences.^\nRATIONALE: Although psilocybin and dextromethorphan (DXM) are hallucinogens, they have different receptor mechanisms of action and have not been directly compared. OBJECTIVE: This study compared subjective, behavioral, and physiological effects of psilocybin and dextromethorphan under conditions that minimized expectancy effects. METHODS: Single, acute oral doses of psilocybin (10, 20, 30 mg/70 kg), DXM (400 mg/70 kg), and placebo were administered under double-blind conditions to 20 healthy participants with histories of hallucinogen use. Instructions to participants and staff minimized expectancy effects. Various subjective, behavioral, and physiological effects were assessed after drug administration. RESULTS: High doses of both drugs produced similar increases in participant ratings of peak overall drug effect strength, with similar times to maximal effect and time-course. Psilocybin produced orderly dose-related increases on most participant-rated subjective measures previously shown sensitive to hallucinogens. DXM produced increases on most of these same measures. However, the high dose of psilocybin produced significantly greater and more diverse visual effects than DXM including greater movement and more frequent, brighter, distinctive, and complex (including textured and kaleidoscopic) images and visions. Compared to DXM, psilocybin also produced significantly greater mystical-type and psychologically insightful experiences and greater absorption in music. In contrast, DXM produced larger effects than psilocybin on measures of disembodiment, nausea/emesis, and light-headedness. Both drugs increased systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and pupil dilation and decreased psychomotor performance and balance. CONCLUSIONS: Psilocybin and DXM produced similar profiles of subjective experiences, with psilocybin producing relatively greater visual, mystical-type, insightful, and musical experiences, and DXM producing greater disembodiment.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.019743606448173523, 0.013235021382570267, 0.0058783902786672115, 0.0076475380919873714, 0.0048924461007118225, 0.006486766971647739, 0.005574236623942852, 0.004461832344532013, 0.0054798852652311325, 0.01135181449353695, 0.008471705950796604, 0.006558738183230162, 0.03258608281612396, 0.9897772669792175]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]"
1439,"Baseline Working Memory Predicted Response to Low-Dose Ketamine Infusion in Patients with Treatment-Resistant Depression.^\nINTRODUCTION: Pretreatment neurocognitive function may predict the treatment response to low-dose ketamine infusion in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). However, the association between working memory function at baseline and the antidepressant efficacy of ketamine infusion remains unclear. METHODS: A total of 71 patients with TRD were randomized to one of three treatment groups: 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, or normal saline. Depressive symptoms were measured using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) at baseline and after treatment. Cognitive function was evaluated using working memory and go-no-go tasks at baseline. RESULTS: A generalized linear model with adjustments for demographic characteristics, treatment groups, and total HDRS scores at baseline revealed only a significant effect of working memory function (correct responses and omissions) on the changes in depressive symptoms measured by HDRS at baseline (F=12.862, p<0.05). Correlation analysis further showed a negative relationship (r=0.519, p=0.027) between pretreatment working memory function and changes in HDRS scores in the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine group. DISCUSSION: An inverse relationship between pretreatment working memory function and treatment response to ketamine infusion may confirm that low-dose ketamine infusion is beneficial and should be reserved for patients with TRD.","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.9838776588439941, 0.9884999394416809, 0.018561994656920433, 0.00946197472512722, 0.010996765457093716, 0.011285663582384586, 0.00925329141318798, 0.007807182148098946, 0.006546238902956247, 0.01158159226179123, 0.010920822620391846, 0.012249251827597618, 0.011890536174178123, 0.037962641566991806]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

However, the applicability of this model to humans is unclear because it currently rests on highly confounded retrospective studies of individuals who experienced protracted psychoses following repeated binges with NMDA receptor antagonists. Objectives: The purpose of the current study was to determine whether there was evidence of sensitization to the behavioral effects of ketamine in healthy human subjects with repeated exposure to this drug. Methods: Data were studied from 295 healthy human subjects who participated in one or more of 11 separate studies that involved ketamine administration over 14 years. Positive and negative symptoms (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale: BPRS), perceptual alterations (Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale: CADSS), and ""high"" and ""anxiety"" states (Visual Analog Scale: VAS) that were measured in all studies were included as outcome measures. Results: After including the number of previous exposures, number of previous studies, and time since first exposure as variables, repeated exposure to ketamine did not result in increased behavioral responses, suggestive of behavioral sensitization.

1537,"Intramuscular ketamine vs. escitalopram and aripiprazole in acute and maintenance treatment of patients with treatment-resistant depression: a randomized double-blind clinical trial.^\nObjective: Ketamine, an N‐methyl D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, can promote rapid action in the management of individuals with treatment‐resistant depression (TRD) at sub‐anesthetic doses. However, few studies have investigated the long‐term use of ketamine administered intravenously (IV) and intranasally (IN). We report the design and rationale of a therapeutic trial for assessing the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of repeated‐dose intramuscular (IM) ketamine vs. active treatment (escitalopram and aripiprazole) in TRD patients. Methods: A comparative, parallel‐group, randomized double‐blind trial assessing the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of acute (4 weeks) and maintenance (24 weeks) use of IM ketamine (0.75 mg/kg) vs. active control (escitalopram 15 mg and aripiprazole 5 mg) in individuals with moderate‐severe intensity TRD (no psychotic symptoms) with or without suicide risk will be conducted. Patients with TRD (18–40 years) will be randomized and blinded to receive ketamine IM or active treatment at a 1:1 ratio for 4 weeks (active treatment) and 24 weeks (maintenance treatment). Subjects will be assessed using clinical scales, monitored for vital signs (VS) after application of injectable medication, and undergo neuropsychological tests. The primary outcome will be changed on the Montgomery‐Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) during the course of the trial. The study is in running. Results: This study can potentially yield evidence on the use of IM ketamine in the treatment of depressive disorders as an ultra‐rapid low‐cost therapy associated with less patient discomfort and reduced use of medical resources, and can elucidate long‐term effects on different outcomes, such as neuropsychological aspects.

1649,"Comparative study of esketamine and racemic ketamine in treatment-resistant depression: Protocol for a non-inferiority clinical trial.^\nINTRODUCTION: The use of ketamine as an option in the treatment of depressive disorder is growing rapidly, supported by numerous clinical trials attesting its efficacy and safety. Esketamine, the S (+) enantiomer of ketamine, is the most widely used form in the anesthetic environment in some countries, and new studies have shown that it may also be effective in depression and with better tolerability. However, no study so far has directly compared esketamine with racemic ketamine. Here we propose a protocol of a clinical trial to evaluate esketamine as a noninferior medication when compared to ketamine in the treatment of patients with treatment-resistant depression. METHODS/DESIGN: This study protocol is for a randomized, controlled, double-blind noninferiority clinical trial. Subjects will be 18 years or older, with major depression characterized as treatment-resistant. Participants will receive a single infusion of either esketamine (0.25 mg/kg) or ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) over 40 minutes. The primary outcome will be the difference in remission rates between the 2 treatment arms at 24 and 72 hours after drug infusion. Secondary outcomes will include other timepoints, measurements of cognition, dissociation, and blood biomarkers. DISCUSSION: A head-to-head study is the best way to evaluate whether the esketamine is in fact comparable to the racemic ketamine in terms of both efficacy and safety, and, if positive, it would be an initial step to increase the access to that type of treatment worldwide. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the local Institutional Review Board (University Hospital Professor Edgard Santos-Federal University of Bahia-Number: 46657415.0.0000.0049). Subjects will only participate after voluntarily agreeing and signing the Informed Consent Form.

In a placebo-controlled, randomized crossover design, the aeGBR power, phase-locking factor (PLF) during a choice reaction task, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Altered State of Consciousness (5D-ASC) Rating Scale were assessed in 25 healthy subjects. Ketamine was applied in a subanaesthetic dose. Low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography was used for EEG source localization. Significant reductions of the aeGBR power and PLF were identified under ketamine administration compared to placebo (p < 0.01). Source-space analysis of aeGBR generators revealed significantly reduced current source density (CSD) within the anterior cingulate cortex during ketamine administration. Ketamine induced an increase in all PANSS (p < 0.001) as well as 5D-ASC scores (p < 0.01) and increased response times (p < 0.001) and error rates (p < 0.01). Only negative symptoms were significantly associated with an aeGBR power decrease (p = 0.033) as revealed by multiple linear regression. These findings argue for a substantial role of the glutamate system in the mediation of dysfunctional gamma band responses and negative symptomatology of schizophrenia and are compatible with the NMDAR hypofunction hypothesis of schizophrenia.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.024951312690973282, 0.014393641613423824, 0.005932795815169811, 0.007431013975292444, 0.0045426408760249615, 0.005954011809080839, 0.005486362148076296, 0.004077016841620207, 0.005082572810351849, 0.010415545664727688, 0.0074855568818748, 0.006440796423703432, 0.03118162602186203, 0.9886866807937622]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]"
1799,"Neurocognitive effects of repeated ketamine infusion treatments in patients with treatment resistant depression: a retrospective chart review.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine has emerged as a rapid-acting antidepressant in treatment-resistant depression (TRD) increasingly used in non-research, clinical settings. Few studies, however, have examined neurocognitive effects of repeated racemic ketamine infusion treatments in patients with TRD. In an effort to identify potential effects after serial infusions, we conducted a retrospective chart review to identify statistically significant changes in cognition in patient undergoing serial intravenous infusions; concomitantly, we examined baseline cognition as potential predictor of anti-depressant potential. METHODS: Twenty-two patients with TRD were examined after they finished the induction phase of 8-10 repeated intravenous ketamine infusions and completed the assessments of their depressive symptoms (measured by the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report Scale: QIDS-SR16) and cognitive function (measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment: MoCA) before the first and the last ketamine treatments. RESULTS: Repeated ketamine infusions administered through an escalating dose protocol with 8-10 infusion sessions produced a 47.2% reduction response in depression; there was no evidence of impairment as reflected in MoCA testing. There was a moderate association between baseline cognition and antidepressant response with a Pearson correlation of 0.453. CONCLUSION: In this naturalistic sample of patients with TRD in our clinical service, repeated ketamine infusions significantly decreased depression symptoms without impairing cognitive performance. The baseline cognition may positively predict antidepressant responses of repeated ketamine treatment.","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.9844799637794495, 0.9869308471679688, 0.017334775999188423, 0.008694320917129517, 0.010329760611057281, 0.010772507637739182, 0.008657771162688732, 0.0072337910532951355, 0.006093971431255341, 0.011091344058513641, 0.01072648074477911, 0.011081479489803314, 0.012031886726617813, 0.034771911799907684]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1806,"A Single Ketamine Infusion Combined With Motivational Enhancement Therapy for Alcohol Use Disorder: A Randomized Midazolam-Controlled Pilot Trial.^\nOBJECTIVE: Pharmacotherapy and behavioral treatments for alcohol use disorder are limited in their effectiveness, and new treatments with innovative mechanisms would be valuable. In this pilot study, the authors tested whether a single subanesthetic infusion of ketamine administered to adults with alcohol dependence and engaged in motivational enhancement therapy affects drinking outcomes. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to a 52-minute intravenous administration of ketamine (0.71 mg/kg, N=17) or the active control midazolam (0.025 mg/kg, N=23), provided during the second week of a 5-week outpatient regimen of motivational enhancement therapy. Alcohol use following the infusion was assessed with timeline followback method, with abstinence confirmed by urine ethyl glucuronide testing. A longitudinal logistic mixed-effects model was used to model daily abstinence from alcohol over the 21 days after ketamine infusion. RESULTS: Participants (N=40) were mostly middle-aged (mean age=53 years [SD=9.8]), predominantly white (70.3%), and largely employed (71.8%) and consumed an average of five drinks per day prior to entering the study. Ketamine significantly increased the likelihood of abstinence, delayed the time to relapse, and reduced the likelihood of heavy drinking days compared with midazolam. Infusions were well tolerated, with no participants removed from the study as a result of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: A single ketamine infusion was found to improve measures of drinking in persons with alcohol dependence engaged in motivational enhancement therapy. These preliminary data suggest new directions in integrated pharmacotherapy-behavioral treatments for alcohol use disorder. Further research is needed to replicate these promising results in a larger sample.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.9639699459075928, 0.15604430437088013, 0.04078326374292374, 0.05220704525709152, 0.8135561943054199, 0.10290823876857758, 0.018298501148819923, 0.0317453108727932, 0.04010218754410744, 0.025084860622882843, 0.02040659449994564, 0.03942914679646492, 0.027106599882245064, 0.07320037484169006]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1850,"Neuronal correlates of visual and auditory alertness in the DMT and ketamine model of psychosis.^\nDeficits in attentional functions belong to the core cognitive symptoms in schizophrenic patients. Alertness is a nonselective attention component that refers to a state of general readiness that improves stimulus processing and response initiation. The main goal of the present study was to investigate cerebral correlates of alertness in the human 5HT(2A) agonist and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) antagonist model of psychosis. Fourteen healthy volunteers participated in a randomized double-blind, cross-over event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study with dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and S-ketamine. A target detection task with cued and uncued trials in both the visual and the auditory modality was used. Administration of DMT led to decreased blood oxygenation level-dependent response during performance of an alertness task, particularly in extrastriate regions during visual alerting and in temporal regions during auditory alerting. In general, the effects for the visual modality were more pronounced. In contrast, administration of S-ketamine led to increased cortical activation in the left insula and precentral gyrus in the auditory modality. The results of the present study might deliver more insight into potential differences and overlapping pathomechanisms in schizophrenia. These conclusions must remain preliminary and should be explored by further fMRI studies with schizophrenic patients performing modality-specific alertness tasks.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.029648415744304657, 0.01686975173652172, 0.006221121642738581, 0.008336574770510197, 0.005271580535918474, 0.006267885211855173, 0.0055384463630616665, 0.004361092112958431, 0.005405249074101448, 0.010211898013949394, 0.007448365446180105, 0.006845006253570318, 0.02496321126818657, 0.9884363412857056]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]"
1866,"Effects of Psilocybin-Assisted Therapy on Major Depressive Disorder: A Randomized Clinical Trial.^\nIMPORTANCE: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a substantial public health burden, but current treatments have limited effectiveness and adherence. Recent evidence suggests that 1 or 2 administrations of psilocybin with psychological support produces antidepressant effects in patients with cancer and in those with treatment-resistant depression. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of psilocybin therapy in patients with MDD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized, waiting list-controlled clinical trial was conducted at the Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center in Baltimore, Maryland. Adults aged 21 to 75 years with an MDD diagnosis, not currently using antidepressant medications, and without histories of psychotic disorder, serious suicide attempt, or hospitalization were eligible to participate. Enrollment occurred between August 2017 and April 2019, and the 4-week primary outcome assessments were completed in July 2019. A total of 27 participants were randomized to an immediate treatment condition group (n = 15) or delayed treatment condition group (waiting list control condition; n = 12). Data analysis was conducted from July 1, 2019, to July 31, 2020, and included participants who completed the intervention (evaluable population). INTERVENTIONS: Two psilocybin sessions (session 1: 20 mg/70 kg; session 2: 30 mg/70 kg) were given (administered in opaque gelatin capsules with approximately 100 mL of water) in the context of supportive psychotherapy (approximately 11 hours). Participants were randomized to begin treatment immediately or after an 8-week delay. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome, depression severity was assessed with the GRID-Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (GRID-HAMD) scores at baseline (score of ≥17 required for enrollment) and weeks 5 and 8 after enrollment for the delayed treatment group, which corresponded to weeks 1 and 4 after the intervention for the immediate treatment group. Secondary outcomes included the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Rated (QIDS-SR). RESULTS: Of the randomized participants, 24 of 27 (89%) completed the intervention and the week 1 and week 4 postsession assessments. This population had a mean (SD) age of 39.8 (12.2) years, was composed of 16 women (67%), and had a mean (SD) baseline GRID-HAMD score of 22.8 (3.9). The mean (SD) GRID-HAMD scores at weeks 1 and 4 (8.0 [7.1] and 8.5 [5.7]) in the immediate treatment group were statistically significantly lower than the scores at the comparable time points of weeks 5 and 8 (23.8 [5.4] and 23.5 [6.0]) in the delayed treatment group. The effect sizes were large at week 5 (Cohen d = 2.5; 95% CI, 1.4-3.5; P < .001) and week 8 (Cohen d = 2.6; 95% CI, 1.5-3.7; P < .001). The QIDS-SR documented a rapid decrease in mean (SD) depression score from baseline to day 1 after session 1 (16.7 [3.5] vs 6.3 [4.4]; Cohen d = 2.6; 95% CI, 1.8-3.5; P < .001), which remained statistically significantly reduced through the week 4 follow-up (6.0 [5.7]; Cohen d = 2.3; 95% CI, 1.5-3.0; P < .001). In the overall sample, 17 participants (71%) at week 1 and 17 (71%) at week 4 had a clinically significant response to the intervention (≥50% reduction in GRID-HAMD score), and 14 participants (58%) at week 1 and 13 participants (54%) at week 4 were in remission (≤7 GRID-HAMD score). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Findings suggest that psilocybin with therapy is efficacious in treating MDD, thus extending the results of previous studies of this intervention in patients with cancer and depression and of a nonrandomized study in patients with treatment-resistant depression.

1964,"Ketamine and other glutamate receptor modulators for depression in adults with bipolar disorder.^\nBACKGROUND: Glutamergic system dysfunction has been implicated in the pathophysiology of bipolar depression. This is an update of the 2015 Cochrane Review for the use of glutamate receptor modulators for depression in bipolar disorder. OBJECTIVES: 1. To assess the effects of ketamine and other glutamate receptor modulators in alleviating the acute symptoms of depression in people with bipolar disorder. 2. To review the acceptability of ketamine and other glutamate receptor modulators in people with bipolar disorder who are experiencing depressive symptoms. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO all years to July 2020.  We did not apply any restrictions to date, language or publication status. SELECTION CRITERIA: RCTs comparing ketamine or other glutamate receptor modulators with other active psychotropic drugs or saline placebo in adults with bipolar depression. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, assessed trial quality and extracted data. Primary outcomes were response rate and adverse events. Secondary outcomes included remission rate, depression severity change scores, suicidality, cognition, quality of life, and dropout rate. The GRADE framework was used to assess the certainty of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS: Ten studies (647 participants) were included in this review (an additional five studies compared to the 2015 review). There were no additional studies added to the comparisons identified in the 2015 Cochrane review on ketamine, memantine and cytidine versus placebo. However, three new comparisons were found: ketamine versus midazolam, N-acetylcysteine versus placebo, and riluzole versus placebo. The glutamate receptor modulators studied were ketamine (three trials), memantine (two), cytidine (one), N-acetylcysteine (three), and riluzole (one). Eight of these studies were placebo-controlled and two-armed. In seven trials the glutamate receptor modulators had been used as add-on drugs to mood stabilisers. Only one trial compared ketamine with an active comparator, midazolam. The treatment period ranged from a single intravenous administration (all ketamine studies), to repeated administration for riluzole, memantine, cytidine, and N-acetylcysteine (with a follow-up of eight weeks, 8 to 12 weeks, 12 weeks, and 16 to 20 weeks, respectively). Six of the studies included sites in the USA, one in Taiwan, one in Denmark, one in Australia, and in one study the location was unclear. All participants had a primary diagnosis of bipolar disorder and were experiencing an acute bipolar depressive episode, diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fourth edition (IV) or fourth edition text revision (IV-TR). Among all glutamate receptor modulators included in this review, only ketamine appeared to be more efficacious than placebo 24 hours after infusion for response rate (odds ratio (OR) 11.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25 to 107.74; P = 0.03; participants = 33; studies = 2; I² = 0%, low-certainty evidence). Ketamine seemed to be more effective in reducing depression rating scale scores (MD -11.81, 95% CI -20.01 to -3.61; P = 0.005; participants = 32; studies = 2; I(2) = 0%, very low-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of ketamine's efficacy in producing remission over placebo at 24 hours (OR 5.16, 95% CI 0.51 to 52.30; P = 0.72; participants = 33; studies = 2; I(2) = 0%, very low-certainty evidence). Evidence on response, remission or depression rating scale scores between ketamine and midazolam was uncertain at 24 hours due to very low-certainty evidence (OR 3.20, 95% CI 0.23 to 45.19). In the one trial assessing ketamine and midazolam, there were no dropouts due to adverse effects or for any reason (very low-certainty evidence). Placebo may have been more effective than N-acetylcysteine in reducing depression rating scale scores at three months, although this was based on very low-certainty evidence (MD 1.28, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.31; participants = 58; studies = 2). Very uncertain evidence found no difference in response at three months (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.32 to 2.14; participants = 69; studies = 2; very low-certainty evidence). No data were available for remission or acceptability. Extremely limited data were available for riluzole vs placebo, finding only very-low certainty evidence of no difference in dropout rates (OR 2.00, 95% CI 0.31 to 12.84; P = 0.46; participants = 19; studies = 1; I(2) = 0%). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: It is difficult to draw reliable conclusions from this review due to the certainty of the evidence being low to very low, and the relatively small amount of data usable for analysis in bipolar disorder, which is considerably less than the information available for unipolar depression. Nevertheless, we found uncertain evidence in favour of a single intravenous dose of ketamine (as add-on therapy to mood stabilisers) over placebo in terms of response rate up to 24 hours, however ketamine did not show any better efficacy for remission in bipolar depression. Even though ketamine has the potential to have a rapid and transient antidepressant effect, the efficacy of a single intravenous dose may be limited. We did not find conclusive evidence on adverse events with ketamine, and there was insufficient evidence to draw meaningful conclusions for the remaining glutamate receptor modulators. However, ketamine's psychotomimetic effects (such as delusions or delirium) may have compromised study blinding in some studies, and so we cannot rule out the potential bias introduced by inadequate blinding procedures. To draw more robust conclusions, further methodologically sound RCTs (with adequate blinding) are needed to explore different modes of administration of ketamine, and to study different methods of sustaining antidepressant response, such as repeated administrations.","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.9873062372207642, 0.9897893071174622, 0.022432774305343628, 0.009552336297929287, 0.013645566999912262, 0.011327961459755898, 0.009866481646895409, 0.008540510199964046, 0.0075766537338495255, 0.01232235599309206, 0.011138965375721455, 0.014639684930443764, 0.01419448759406805, 0.027424586936831474]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
1966,"Effectiveness of a neuroscience-based, harm reduction program for older adolescents: A cluster randomised controlled trial of the Illicit Project.^\nThe prevention of risky adolescent substance use is critical. Limited age-appropriate, school-based programs target adolescents aged 16-19 years, despite this representing the age of initiation and escalation of substance use. The Illicit Project is a neuroscience-based, harm reduction program targeting late adolescents, designed to address this gap. The current study aims to evaluate the program's effectiveness in reducing risky substance use and related harms among late adolescents. A cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted involving 950 students (M(age) = 15.9 years SD = 0.68; 60% Female) from eight secondary schools in Australia. Five schools received The Illicit Project program, and three schools were randomised into the active control group (health education as usual). All students completed a self-report survey at baseline and 6-months post-baseline and intervention students completed a program evaluation survey. Outcomes include alcohol and substance use, alcohol related harms and drug literacy levels (knowledge and skills). At 6-months post baseline, individuals in the intervention group were less likely to engage in weekly binge drinking (OR = 0.56), high monthly alcohol consumption (OR = 0.56), early onset cannabis use (OR = 0.35), risky single occasion cannabis use (OR = 0.48), MDMA use (OR = 0.16) or nicotine product use (OR = 0.59) compared to the control group. Students in the intervention group were less likely to have experience alcohol related harms (OR = 0.57) and more likely to have higher drug literacy scores (β = 2.44) at follow-up.

The aim of the present study was to assess the acute effects of co-administration of MDMA and THC (the main psychoactive compound of cannabis) on pharmacokinetics, psychomotor performance, memory and subjective experience over time. We performed a four-way, double blind, randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled study in 16 healthy volunteers (12 male, four female) between the ages of 18 and 27. MDMA (100 mg) was given orally, THC (4, 6, and 6 mg, interval of 90 min) was vaporized and inhaled. THC induced more robust cognitive impairment compared with MDMA, and co-administration did not exacerbate single drug effects on cognitive function. However, co-administration of THC with MDMA increased desired subjective drug effects and drug strength compared with the MDMA condition, which may explain the widespread use of this combination.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.023503486067056656, 0.016450051218271255, 0.005704584531486034, 0.007356170564889908, 0.0051046255975961685, 0.006470227148383856, 0.005491834133863449, 0.004431408364325762, 0.005444868002086878, 0.010683784261345863, 0.007809372153133154, 0.006156075280159712, 0.03039848990738392, 0.9892393350601196]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]"
2301,"Long-term outcomes of psychoactive drug use in trauma patients: A multicenter patient-reported outcomes study.^\nINTRODUCTION: Psychoactive drug use (PDU) is reported in up to 40% of trauma patients and is associated with a higher rate of in-hospital complications. However, little is known about its long-term impact on trauma patients. We aimed to assess the long-term functional, mental, and psychosocial outcomes of PDU in trauma patients 6 to 12 months after injury. METHODS: Trauma patients with moderate to severe injuries (Injury Severity Score, >9) who had a toxicology screen upon admission to one of three level 1 trauma centers were contacted by phone 6 to 12 months postinjury. Psychoactive drug use was defined as the presence of a psychoactive, nonprescribed substance on toxicology screen including amphetamine, barbiturate, benzodiazepine, cannabinoid, methamphetamine, methadone, opioid, oxycodone, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy), phencyclidine, tricyclic antidepressant, and cocaine. The interviews systematically evaluated functional limitations, social functioning, chronic pain, and mental health (posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety). Patients with a score of ≤47 on the Short-Form Health Survey version 2.0 social functioning subdomain were considered to have social dysfunction. Multivariable regression models were built to determine the independent association between PDU and long-term outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 1,699 eligible patients, 571 (34%) were included in the analysis, and 173 (30.3%) screened positive for PDU on admission. Patients with PDU were younger (median age [interquartile range], 43 [28-55] years vs. 66 [46-78] years, p < 0.001), had more penetrating injuries (8.7% vs. 4.3%, p = 0.036), and were less likely to have received a college education (41.3% vs. 54.5%, p = 0.004). After adjusting for patients' characteristics including the presence of a baseline psychiatric comorbidity, patients with PDU on admission were more likely to suffer from daily chronic pain, mental health disorders, and social dysfunction 6 to 12 months after injury. There was no difference in the functional limitations between patients with and without PDU. CONCLUSION: On the long term, PDU in trauma patients is strongly and independently associated with worse mental health, more chronic pain, and severe impairment in social functioning. A trauma hospitalization presents an opportunity to identify patients at risk and to mitigate the long-term impact of PDU on recovery.

2864,"Psilocybin-occasioned mystical experiences in the treatment of tobacco addiction.^\nPsilocybin-occasioned mystical experiences have been linked to persisting effects in healthy volunteers including positive changes in behavior, attitudes, and values, and increases in the personality domain of openness. In an open-label pilot-study of psilocybin-facilitated smoking addiction treatment, 15 smokers received 2 or 3 doses of psilocybin in the context of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for smoking cessation. Twelve of 15 participants (80%) demonstrated biologically verified smoking abstinence at 6-month follow-up. Participants who were abstinent at 6 months (n=12) were compared to participants still smoking at 6 months (n=3) on measures of subjective effects of psilocybin. Abstainers scored significantly higher on a measure of psilocybin-occasioned mystical experience. No significant differences in general intensity of drug effects were found between groups, suggesting that mystical-type subjective effects, rather than overall intensity of drug effects, were responsible for smoking cessation. Nine of 15 participants (60%) met criteria for ""complete"" mystical experience. Smoking cessation outcomes were significantly correlated with measures of mystical experience on session days, as well as retrospective ratings of personal meaning and spiritual significance of psilocybin sessions. These results suggest a mediating role of mystical experience in psychedelic-facilitated addiction treatment.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.927960216999054, 0.08504333347082138, 0.028929710388183594, 0.02814454212784767, 0.057432275265455246, 0.5636972188949585, 0.014742791652679443, 0.0167013518512249, 0.013337341137230396, 0.04302440211176872, 0.020995542407035828, 0.01565573178231716, 0.07940105348825455, 0.13430756330490112]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

3175,"Survey of subjective ""God encounter experiences"": Comparisons among naturally occurring experiences and those occasioned by the classic psychedelics psilocybin, LSD, ayahuasca, or DMT.^\nNaturally occurring and psychedelic drug–occasioned experiences interpreted as personal encounters with God are well described but have not been systematically compared. In this study, five groups of individuals participated in an online survey with detailed questions characterizing the subjective phenomena, interpretation, and persisting changes attributed to their single most memorable God encounter experience (n = 809 Non-Drug, 1184 psilocybin, 1251 lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), 435 ayahuasca, and 606 N,N-dimethyltrypta-mine (DMT)). Analyses of differences in experiences were adjusted statistically for demographic differences between groups. The Non-Drug Group was most likely to choose ""God"" as the best descriptor of that which was encountered while the psychedelic groups were most likely to choose ""Ultimate Reality."" Although there were some other differences between non-drug and the combined psychedelic group, as well as between the four psychedelic groups, the similarities among these groups were most striking. Most participants reported vivid memories of the encounter experience, which frequently involved communication with something having the attributes of being conscious, benevolent, intelligent, sacred, eternal, and all-knowing. The encounter experience fulfilled a priori criteria for being a complete mystical experience in approximately half of the participants. More than two-thirds of those who identified as atheist before the experience no longer identified as atheist afterwards. These experiences were rated as among the most personally meaningful and spiritually significant lifetime experiences, with moderate to strong persisting positive changes in life satisfaction, purpose, and meaning attributed to these experiences. Among the four groups of psychedelic users, the psilocybin and LSD groups were most similar and the ayahuasca group tended to have the highest rates of endorsing positive features and enduring consequences of the experience. Future exploration of predisposing factors and phenomenological and neural correlates of such experiences may provide new insights into religious and spiritual beliefs that have been integral to shaping human culture since time immemorial.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0]","[0.01365634799003601, 0.009451402351260185, 0.005458376370370388, 0.006492091342806816, 0.006096715573221445, 0.011940879747271538, 0.006563888397067785, 0.006509627681225538, 0.00596412131562829, 0.028408031910657883, 0.009661420248448849, 0.006085209082812071, 0.5472821593284607, 0.9930232763290405]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0]"
3238,"19.3 Psilocybin-Assisted Therapy for MDD: current Evidence and Clinical Considerations.^\nObjectives: Psilocybin‐assisted therapy is currently being investigated for its therapeutic potential in the treatment of MDD in adults. This talk will review the typical therapeutic approach, along with some of the major findings in this area to date, with a focus on the results from a prospective long‐term follow‐up study of patients with moderate to severe depression who received 2 doses of psilocybin in a supported setting. Methods: This randomized, waiting‐list controlled study enrolled 27 patients aged 21 to 75 years with moderate to severe unipolar depression (GRID‐HAMD ≥17). Participants were randomized to an immediate or delayed (8 weeks) treatment condition in which they received 2 doses of psilocybin with supportive psychotherapy. Twenty‐four participants completed both psilocybin sessions and were followed through 12 months following their second dose. Results: All 24 participants attended all follow‐up visits through the 12‐month timepoint. Large decreases from baseline in GRID Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (GRID‐HAMD) scores were observed at 1‐, 3‐, 6‐, and 12‐month follow‐up (Cohen d = 2.3, 2.0, 2.6, and 2.4, respectively). Treatment response (≥50% reduction in GRID‐HAMD score from baseline) and remission were 75% and 58%, respectively, at 12 months. There were no serious adverse events judged to be related to psilocybin in the long‐term follow‐up period, and no participants reported psilocybin use outside of the context of the study. Participant ratings of personal meaning, spiritual experience, and mystical experience after the sessions predicted increased well‐being at 12 months but did not predict improvement in depression. One‐third of the participants began treatment with an antidepressant medication during the follow‐up period. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that the substantial antidepressant effects of psilocybin‐assisted therapy may be durable at least through 12 months following acute intervention in some patients. Contextual factors and psychotherapy likely play a substantial role in the safety and efficacy of the treatment and will require careful consideration if this intervention is studied in younger patient populations.

3257,"Efficacy and safety of perioperative application of ketamine on postoperative depression: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies.^\nKetamine, a commonly used general anesthetic, can produce rapid and sustained antidepressant effect. However, the efficacy and safety of the perioperative application of ketamine on postoperative depression remains uncertain. We performed a meta-analysis to determine the effect of perioperative intravenous administration of ketamine on postoperative depression. Randomized controlled trials comparing ketamine with placebo in patients were included. Primary outcome was postoperative depression scores. Secondary outcomes included postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain and adverse effects associated with ketamine. Fifteen studies with 1697 patients receiving ketamine and 1462 controls were enrolled. Compared with the controls, the ketamine group showed a reduction in postoperative depression scores, by a standardized mean difference (SMD) of -0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI, -1.27, -0.66], P < 0.001, I(2) = 72% on postoperative day (POD) 1; SMD-0.65, 95% CI [-1.12, -0.17], P < 0.001, I(2) = 94% on POD 3; SMD-0.30, 95% CI [-0.45, -0.14], P < 0.001, I(2) = 0% on POD 7; and SMD-0.25, 95% CI [-0.38, -0.11], P < 0.001, I(2) = 59% over the long term. Ketamine reduced VAS pain scores on POD 1 (SMD-0.93, 95% CI [-1.58, -0.29], P = 0.005, I(2) = 97%), but no significant difference was found between the two groups on PODs 3 and 7 or over the long term. However, ketamine administration distinctly increased the risk of adverse effects, including nausea and vomiting (risk ratio [RR] 1.40, 95% CI [1.12, 1.75], P = 0.003, I(2) = 30%), headache (RR 2.47, 95% CI [1.41, 4.32], P = 0.002, I(2) = 19%), hallucination (RR 15.35, 95% CI [6.(2)4, 37.34], P < 0.001, I(2) = 89%), and dizziness (RR 3.48, 95% CI [2.68, 4.50], P < 0.001, I(2) = 89%) compared with the controls.

Using an open label, within-subjects protocol, 15 males and 5 females (mean age = 30.8 years) were administered three fixed, stepwise increasing sub-anaesthetic doses of intravenous (IV) ketamine solution [(i) 8 mg/h IV infusion plus 30 mg bolus, (ii) 12 mg/h IV infusion and (iii) 20 mg/h infusion]. Whole blood ketamine and norketamine concentrations were determined at each treatment step and at 2 h post-infusion. Driving performance was assessed at baseline, at each treatment step and at 2 h post-treatment using a validated computerised driving simulator. Standard Deviation of Lateral Position (SDLP) and Steering Variability (SV) were assessed. Linear Fixed Effect Modelling indicated a main effect for time (dose) for SDLP (F[4,72] = 33.22, p < 0.0001) and SV (F[4,72] = 4.65, p < 0.002). Post-hoc analyses revealed significant differences from baseline at each treatment step for SDLP (all p < 0.001), and for 12 mg/h treatment step for SV (p = 0.049). Post-treatment driving performance returned to baseline levels. Weak positive linear associations were observed between SDLP and whole blood ketamine concentrations (R2 = 0.11, β = 29.96, p = 0.001) and norketamine (R² = 0.09, β = 28.87, p = 0.003). These findings suggest that even under highly controlled conditions, ketamine intoxication significantly alters simulated driving performance. At the highest dose, ketamine produced changes to SDLP considered incompatible with safe driving, highlighting how ketamine consumption may translate to an increased risk of road trauma.

This study investigates current information on the trends and correlates of LSD use from years 2002–2018 and seeks to develop an initial typology of use and misuse. Methods: Data is taken from the NSDUH (National Survey on Drug Use and Health) collected between 2002 and 2018 and trends and correlates of LSD use were analyzed with a survey adjusted logistic regression. Results: Our findings indicate that LSD use has increased 200 % over the study period (.23 % 2002−2005 to .72 % 2015−2018, AOR = 1.10, 95 % CI = 1.08, 1.12).

4884,"Group format psychedelic-assisted therapy interventions: Observations and impressions from the HOPE trial.^\nBackground: Psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy has demonstrated significant promise as a treatment for depression, anxiety, and existential distress associated with serious medical illness and has generally been employed on an individual basis, which presents challenges for scaling and resource availability. There are also compelling theoretical reasons to suggest that group-based formats-if utilized in a thoughtful fashion-might offer unique or enhanced therapeutic benefits for certain conditions or populations. The HOPE trial is an IRB-approved open-label feasibility and safety pilot study of psi-locybin enhanced group therapy in patients with a DSM-5 depressive disorder associated with a cancer diagnosis completed at the Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) in Salt Lake City, Utah (HOPE: A Pilot Study of Psilocybin Enhanced Group Psychotherapy in Patients with Cancer). We report here quali-tative survey-based data, impressions, and suggestions for group-based psychedelic-assisted therapy interventions based on our observations to inform future studies. Methods: Patients with a DSM-5 depressive disorder with an underlying cancer diagnosis were recruited from HCI by referral from oncology providers, palliative care, and social work. Following screening and consenting, 4-6 partici-pants per cohort (with three total cohorts) were enrolled in a protocol involving 3 120 min group preparatory sessions, a single high-dose (25 mg) group psilocybin session, and 3 subsequent group integration sessions. Primary clinical outcomes are still in process of data collection and analysis. Qualitative data was gathered from patient written reports and a survey administered at 2 weeks post intervention. Qualitative reports were also gathered from the therapist team at a post-study group process session. Findings: We report here results from a qualitative survey of participant experiences with group format study design, as well as impressions and guidelines for group format and group psychotherapeutic process to inform other studies pursuing group-based interventions in psychedelic therapy. Suggestions are provided for protocol design, screening processes, space considerations, therapist team structure, group process, music, timeline, as well as potential issues and challenges.","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.9769948720932007, 0.9819357991218567, 0.7583271861076355, 0.0647997111082077, 0.0985482707619667, 0.08726377785205841, 0.06877956539392471, 0.08464785665273666, 0.06544391810894012, 0.05716589093208313, 0.06690094619989395, 0.8441150784492493, 0.0459846667945385, 0.04109745845198631]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
5173,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor and initial antidepressant response to an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist.^\nOBJECTIVE: A model has been proposed to explain the pathophysiology of mood disorders based on decreased neurotrophin levels during mood episodes; treatment with antidepressants and mood stabilizers is associated with clinical improvement. This study investigated whether changes in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels are associated with the initial antidepressant effects of ketamine, a high-affinity N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist. METHOD: Twenty-three subjects aged 18 to 65 years with DSM-IV major depressive disorder (treatment resistant) participated in this study, which was conducted between October 2006 and May 2008. The subjects were given an open-label intravenous infusion of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) and rated using various depression scales at baseline and at 40, 80, 120, and 230 minutes postinfusion. The primary outcome measure was the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score. BDNF levels were obtained at the same time points as depression rating scale scores. RESULTS: Despite a significant (P <. 001) improvement in MADRS scores after subjects received ketamine treatment, no changes in BDNF levels were observed in subjects after they received ketamine compared to baseline. Also, no association was found between antidepressant response and BDNF levels. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that ketamine's rapid initial antidepressant effects are not mediated by BDNF. Further studies are necessary to shed light on the neurobiological basis of these effects.

5469,"Sleep deprivation differentially impairs cognitive performance in abstinent methylenedioxymethamphetamine (""Ecstasy"") users.^\nMethylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ""Ecstasy"") is a popular recreational drug and brain serotonin (5-HT) neurotoxin. Neuroimaging data indicate that some human MDMA users develop persistent deficits in brain 5-HT neuronal markers. Although the consequences of MDMA-induced 5-HT neurotoxicity are not fully understood, abstinent MDMA users have been found to have subtle cognitive deficits and altered sleep architecture. The present study sought to test the hypothesis that sleep disturbance plays a role in cognitive deficits in MDMA users. Nineteen abstinent MDMA users and 21 control subjects participated in a 5 d inpatient study in a clinical research unit. Baseline sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory. Cognitive performance was tested three times daily using a computerized cognitive battery. On the third day of admission, subjects began a 40 h sleep deprivation period and continued cognitive testing using the same daily schedule. At baseline, MDMA users performed less accurately than controls on a task of working memory and more impulsively on four of the seven computerized tests. During sleep deprivation, MDMA users, but not controls, became increasingly impulsive, performing more rapidly at the expense of accuracy on tasks of working and short-term memory. Tests of mediation implicated baseline sleep disturbance in the cognitive decline seen during sleep deprivation. These findings are the first to demonstrate that memory problems in MDMA users may be related, at least in part, to sleep disturbance and suggest that cognitive deficits in MDMA users may become more prominent in situations associated with sleep deprivation.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0]","[0.015475418418645859, 0.010254882276058197, 0.008262613788247108, 0.010385246016085148, 0.008904542773962021, 0.02173462323844433, 0.012307514436542988, 0.01362584624439478, 0.010466063395142555, 0.10592722147703171, 0.016583453863859177, 0.00822520349174738, 0.9571084976196289, 0.9862537384033203]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0]"
5794,"Neural correlates of the severity of cocaine, heroin, alcohol, MDMA and cannabis use in polysubstance abusers: A resting-PET brain metabolism study.^\nIntroduction: Functional imaging studies of addiction following protracted abstinence have not been systematically conducted to look at the associations between severity of use of different drugs and brain dysfunction. Findings from such studies may be relevant to implement specific interventions for treatment. The aim of this study was to examine the association between resting-state regional brain metabolism (measured with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) and the severity of use of cocaine, heroin, alcohol, MDMA and cannabis in a sample of polysubstance users with prolonged abstinence from all drugs used. Methods: Our sample consisted of 49 polysubstance users enrolled in residential treatment. We conducted correlation analyses between estimates of use of cocaine, heroin, alcohol, MDMA and cannabis and brain metabolism (BM) (using Statistical Parametric Mapping voxel-based (VB) whole-brain analyses). In all correlation analyses conducted for each of the drugs we controlled for the co-abuse of the other drugs used. Results: The analysis showed significant negative correlations between severity of heroin, alcohol, MDMA and cannabis use and BM in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and temporal cortex. Alcohol use was further associated with lower metabolism in frontal premotor cortex and putamen, and stimulants use with parietal cortex. Conclusions: Duration of use of different drugs negatively correlated with overlapping regions in the DLPFC, whereas severity of cocaine, heroin and alcohol use selectively impact parietal, temporal, and frontal-premotor/basal ganglia regions respectively. The knowledge of these associations could be useful in the clinical practice since different brain alterations have been associated with different patterns of execution that may affect the rehabilitation of these patients. © 2012 Moreno-López et al.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0]","[0.06828999519348145, 0.022439295426011086, 0.03026704117655754, 0.030215859413146973, 0.051508452743291855, 0.1345677226781845, 0.05202886462211609, 0.05896930396556854, 0.04868949204683304, 0.7671854496002197, 0.059505362063646317, 0.026624180376529694, 0.9647541642189026, 0.8883923292160034]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0]"
5928,"Evidence that subanesthetic doses of ketamine cause sustained disruptions of NMDA and AMPA-mediated frontoparietal connectivity in humans.^\nFollowing the discovery of the antidepressant properties of ketamine, there has been a recent resurgence in the interest in this NMDA receptor antagonist. Although detailed animal models of the molecular mechanisms underlying ketamine’s effects have emerged, there are few MEG/EEG studies examining the acute subanesthetic effects of ketamine infusion in man. We recorded 275 channel MEG in two experiments (n = 25 human males) examining the effects of subanesthetic ketamine infusion. MEG power spectra revealed a rich set of significant oscillatory changes compared with placebo sessions, including decreases in occipital, parietal, and anterior cingulate alpha power, increases in medial frontal theta power, and increases in parietal and cingulate cortex high gamma power. Each of these spectral effects demonstrated their own set of temporal dynamics. Dynamic causal modeling of frontoparietal connectivity changes with ketamine indicated a decrease in NMDA and AMPA-mediated frontal-to-parietal connectivity. AMPA-mediated connectivity changes were sustained for up to 50 min after ketamine infusion had ceased, by which time perceptual distortions were absent. The results also indicated a decrease in gain of parietal pyramidal cells, which was correlated with participants’ self-reports of blissful state. Based on these results, we suggest that the antidepressant effects of ketamine may depend on its ability to change the balance of frontoparietal connectivity patterns.

6060,"MDMA-assisted Psychotherapy for Anxiety Associated With a Life-threatening Illness.^\nIIndividuals facing, or who have faced, a life‐threatening illness contend with more than just the physical symptoms of their condition. Research suggests that diagnosis of, and living with a life‐threatening illness can result in symptoms similar to those seen in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). 3,‐4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a monoamine releaser with a unique pharmacological profile that include decreased feelings of fear, increased positive mood and increased interpersonal trust. Findings from clinical trials in people with PTSD and anecdotal reports suggest that MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy may assist people who are anxious as a result of facing a life‐threatening illness. This randomized, placebo‐controlled pilot study of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy in 18 people with anxiety stemming from a life‐threatening illness examines the safety and efficacy of this treatment. This study will allow comparison between the impact of placebo and an active dose of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy on anxiety, depression, sleep quality, global functioning, attitudes toward death, posttraumatic growth, mindfulness, self‐compassion, and overall quality of life. Participants must be people of either gender aged 18 years or older diagnosed with a life‐threatening cancer or non‐dementing neurological illness and anxiety resulting from confronting this illness. Eighteen participants will be enrolled in the study. Five of 18 participants will receive placebo and 13 will receive MDMA. Therapy will be conducted by male/female teams, some of whom will be experienced therapists, and the others will be intern therapists under supervision of the Principal Investigator. In the first study segment, Stage 1, all participants will have two blinded experimental sessions of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy scheduled at a two to four week interval, within a moderate course of non‐drug psychotherapy (preparatory and integrative sessions), after which they will complete the primary endpoint assessment. After the primary endpoint assessment, the subject and therapists will be unblinded and fully debriefed. Participants assigned to receive active dose MDMA will then receive a third open‐label experimental session with the same active dose of MDMA, which will complete Stage 1. Participants assigned to receive placebo will crossover, without completing Stage 1, to an open‐label study segment following similar procedures, referred to as Stage 2. Participants enrolled in this group will receive the same dose of MDMA as the active dose in Stage 1, with an optional supplemental half dose, at each of three experimental sessions at time points equivalent to those in Stage 1. Anxiety, depression, sleep quality, attitudes toward death, posttraumatic growth, mindfulness, self‐compassion, and overall quality of life will be assessed by participants' self‐report at baseline, the primary endpoint, and one month after the third experimental session in Stage 1, and at equivalent points in Stage 2. Additional assessments of depression and overall psychological functioning will be made by a blinded Independent Rater at these time points. A caregiver and individuals in close relationship to the study subject will also provide ratings of the subject's posttraumatic growth and mood. Symptoms, long‐term benefits, and harms will be assessed again at 6 months and 12 months after the final experimental session. This study will provide an estimate of effect size based on response of psychological symptoms to MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy.","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.9709345102310181, 0.3418801724910736, 0.8608568906784058, 0.697106659412384, 0.26398321986198425, 0.18842867016792297, 0.06312531977891922, 0.06469675153493881, 0.06943359971046448, 0.0474492609500885, 0.05782407522201538, 0.7791209816932678, 0.034037813544273376, 0.04479239881038666]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

6121,"A Multi-Site Phase 3 Study of MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy for PTSD II.^\nPTSD is a serious debilitating disorder that negatively impacts a person's daily life. PTSD is a stress‐related psychiatric condition that may occur following a traumatic event such as war, disaster, sexual abuse, violence, terrorism, and accidents. PTSD negatively impacts a person's daily life, resulting in relationship difficulties, difficulty in finding and maintaining a job, reduced cognitive and psychosocial functioning, substance abuse, high‐cost healthcare use, and increased depression and suicide risk. Available PTSD treatments, including medications and therapy, effectively treat only a fraction of people who try them for adequate dose and duration. People with PTSD can be treated with psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies. In the past decade, there has been a growing amount of research into medications and other methods that may augment the effectiveness of psychotherapy for PTSD. 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a drug that releases serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain and indirectly increases levels of the neurohormones oxytocin, arginine vasopressin and cortisol. The combined neurobiological effects of MDMA increase compassion, reduce defenses and fear of emotional injury, and enhance communication and introspection. MDMA produces anxiolytic and prosocial effects, which counteract avoidance and hyperarousal in the context of therapy. A combined treatment of MDMA and psychotherapy may be especially useful for treating PTSD. This multi‐site, double‐blind, randomized Phase 3 study assesses the efficacy and safety of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy versus psychotherapy with placebo control in participants diagnosed with at least severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The study will be conducted in N ≈ 100 participants. Participants will be enrolled in one of two groups at a 1:1 ratio. A flexible dose of MDMA or placebo, followed by a supplemental half‐dose unless contraindicated, is administered during the Treatment Period with manualized psychotherapy in three monthly Experimental Sessions. This 12‐week Treatment Period is preceded by three Preparatory Sessions. During the Treatment Period, each Experimental Session is followed by three Integrative Sessions of non‐drug psychotherapy. The Primary Outcome measure is change in Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM 5 (CAPS‐5) from Baseline. Exploratory measures will address specific symptoms, or behavior that is sometimes related to PTSD. Drug safety will be assessed by measuring blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature during experimental sessions, collecting adverse events and measuring suicidal thoughts or behaviors with the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS). This study will compare the effects of three manualized Experimental Sessions of psychotherapy supported by assisted by flexible doses of MDMA versus placebo. Initial doses per Experimental Session include 80 mg or 120 mg of MDMA compounded with mannitol and magnesium stearate or placebo alone (mannitol and magnesium stearate), followed 1.5 to 2 hours later by a supplemental half‐dose (40 or 60 mg).

6295,"Inpatient Buprenorphine Induction With Psilocybin for Opioid Use Disorder.^\nThe proposed study is a double‐blind, controlled investigation of the effect of 1 high‐dose psilocybin (30 mg) session compared to a very low dose session (1 mg) following standard‐of‐care buprenorphine induction on drug abstinence, quality of life, craving, tobacco use, and treatment retention in healthy participants with an active OUD diagnosis. Use of buprenorphine follow standard of care, and the investigators are investigating the additive power of adjunctive psilocybin to enhance opioid abstinence, treatment adherence, quality of life, and mood. The study will consist of a brief (6‐8 day) inpatient phase for standard buprenorphine induction as well as experimental psilocybin administration, an 8‐week outpatient phase involving standard buprenorphine maintenance and experimental follow‐up meetings, and long‐term follow‐up sessions for 4 months after. During the inpatient phase, participants will be inducted onto sublingual (SL) buprenorphine (using a buprenorphine/naloxone combination product) while admitted to the Bayview Clinical Research Unit. During this time, participants will also undergo 2‐3 preparatory sessions, and will undergo an experimental drug administration session under supportive conditions, during which the participants will receive either a very low dose (1 mg) or a single high (30mg) oral dose of psilocybin under double‐blind conditions. At the end of the inpatient phase, participants will be discharged to complete the 8‐week outpatient phase, during which participants will undergo visits at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 weeks post‐dosing session for monitoring of adverse events, clinical status, treatment adherence, and to receive a weekly supply of buprenorphine. All buprenorphine procedures will be open label and will follow standard‐of‐care practices.

6427,"NMDA hypofunction in the posterior cingulate as a model for schizophrenia: an exploratory ketamine administration study in fMRI.^\nBACKGROUND: Based on animal data, NMDA receptor hypofunction has been suggested as a model for positive symptoms in schizophrenia. NMDA receptor hypofunction affects several corticolimbic brain regions, of which the posterior cingulate seems to be the most sensitive. However, empirical support for a crucial role of posterior cingulate NMDA hypofunction in the pathophysiology of positive symptoms is still missing in humans. We therefore conducted an fMRI study using the NMDA antagonist ketamine in healthy human subjects during episodic memory retrieval, which is supposed to activate the posterior cingulate. METHODS: We investigated 16 healthy subjects which were assigned to either placebo (n = 7; saline) or ketamine (n = 9; 0.6 mg/kg/h) group in a double-blind study design. All subjects received their infusion while performing an episodic memory retrieval task in the scanner. Immediately after the fMRI session, psychopathological effects of ketamine were measured using the Altered States of Consciousness Questionnaire. RESULTS: The placebo group showed BOLD signal increases in the posterior and anterior cingulate during retrieval. Signal increases were significantly lower in the ketamine group. Lower signal increases in the posterior cingulate correlated significantly with positive (i.e. psychosis-like) symptoms induced by ketamine. CONCLUSION: The present study for the first time demonstrates a relationship between NMDA receptors, posterior cingulate and positive (i.e. psychosis-like) symptoms in humans. Confirming findings from animal studies, it supports the hypothesis of a pathophysiological role of NMDA receptor hypofunction in the posterior cingulate in schizophrenia.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.029544811695814133, 0.016814781352877617, 0.005840248893946409, 0.007942302152514458, 0.0048374515026807785, 0.005924216005951166, 0.005313760135322809, 0.004099810495972633, 0.0052043073810637, 0.009497862309217453, 0.007108934223651886, 0.005930028855800629, 0.023881297558546066, 0.9884735941886902]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]"

MDMA produced a time-dependent decrease in the CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio due to a decrease in the number of CD4 T-helper cells, a decrease in the functional responsiveness of lymphocytes to mitogenic stimulation, and a simultaneous increase in natural killer cells. In case of two 100 mg MDMA doses given 4 hour apart, immune alterations produced by the first dose were strengthened by the second one. At 24 hours after treatment, statistically significant residual effects were observed for all the altered immune parameters after the administration of two MDMA doses if compared to single dose and placebo. In the second clinical trial, the second 100 mg MDMA dose given 24 hours after the first dose produced immunological changes significantly greater than those induced by the initial drug administration and which seemed to show a delayed onset. Significant residual effects were observed for all the immune parameters as late as 48 hours after the second dose.

6644,"The effects of psilocybin on the dynamics of eeg changes in human volunteers.^\nPsilocybin is a serotonergic psychedelic with an agonist activity at 5‐HT2A/C and 5‐HT1A receptors. It is used as a research tool to study neurobiology of psychosis as well as it is gaining attention as a possible therapeutic tool to treat depression, anxiety, and addiction. It has been already shown that psychedelics, including psilocybin, acutely induce desynchronization of the alpha activity occipitally and disconnection during the peak of intoxication. However, understanding of the dynamics of these changes has not been evaluated yet. Therefore, the current study focuses on the behavioral and EEG effects of psilocybin at several time points during the 6 hours of intoxication. Twenty volunteers with a balanced gender ratio (10 male/10 female) entered the study. Each participant underwent 2 sessions with oral psilocybin (0.26 mg/kg) or a placebo in a double‐blinded crossover design. In most of the subjects, psilocybin induced fully psychedelic effects as measured by psychometric scales, the effects peaked between 1 and 2 hours after administration. Decreased current density of the alpha band in the occipital region, which diminished over time was the most robust finding.

6677,"Human Pharmacology of Mephedrone in Comparison with MDMA.^\nMephedrone (4-methylmethcathinone) is a novel psychoactive substance popular among drug users because it displays similar effects to MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, ecstasy). Mephedrone consumption has been associated with undesirable effects and fatal intoxications. At present, there is no research available on its pharmacological effects in humans under controlled and experimental administration. This study aims to evaluate the clinical pharmacology of mephedrone and its relative abuse liability compared with MDMA. Twelve male volunteers participated in a randomized, double-blind, crossover, and placebo-controlled trial. The single oral dose conditions were: mephedrone 200 mg, MDMA 100 mg, and placebo. Outcome variables included physiological, subjective, and psychomotor effects, and pharmacokinetic parameters. The protocol was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02232789). Mephedrone produced a significant increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and pupillary diameter. It elicited stimulant-like effects, euphoria, and well-being, and induced mild changes in perceptions with similar ratings to those observed after MDMA administration although effects peaked earlier and were shorter in duration. Maximal plasma concentration values for mephedrone and MDMA peaked at 1.25 h and 2.00 h, respectively. The elimination half-life for mephedrone was 2.15 h and 7.89 h for MDMA. In a similar manner to MDMA, mephedrone exhibits high abuse liability. Its earlier onset and shorter duration of effects, probably related to its short elimination half-life, could explain a more compulsive pattern of use as described by the users.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.022503109648823738, 0.014466596767306328, 0.005532904993742704, 0.007245350629091263, 0.004934582393616438, 0.006727887783199549, 0.00550426309928298, 0.004242803435772657, 0.005401345901191235, 0.011052030138671398, 0.007838132791221142, 0.005828900262713432, 0.03256194293498993, 0.9895768165588379]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]"

Children with bipolar disorder (BD) often respond poorly to pharmacotherapy, including polypharmacy. A pediatric-onset Fear of Harm (FOH) phenotype has been described, and is characterized by severe clinical features and resistance to accepted treatments for BD. The potential efficacy and safety of intranasal ketamine in children with BD with FOH-phenotype were assessed by a systematic retrospective chart review of a case series from the private practice of one of the authors, including cases with clear refractoriness to mood stabilizers, antipsychotics and benzodiazepines. METHODS: A comparison was made between routinely collected symptom measures 1-2 weeks prior to and after the administration of ketamine, in 12 treatment-refractory youth, 10 males 2 females ages 6-19years. RESULTS: Ketamine administration was associated with a substantial reduction in measures of mania, fear of harm and aggression. Significant improvement was observed in mood, anxiety and behavioral symptoms, attention/executive functions, insomnia, parasomnias and sleep inertia. Treatment was generally well-tolerated.

6979,"Modulatory effect of the 5-HT1A agonist buspirone and the mixed non-hallucinogenic 5-HT1A/2A agonist ergotamine on psilocybin-induced psychedelic experience.^\nThe mixed serotonin (5-HT) 1A/2A/2B/2C/6/7 receptor agonist psilocybin dose-dependently induces an altered state of consciousness (ASC) that is characterized by changes in sensory perception, mood, thought, and the sense of self. The psychological effects of psilocybin are primarily mediated by 5-HT2A receptor activation. However, accumulating evidence suggests that 5-HT1A or an interaction between 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors may contribute to the overall effects of psilocybin. Therefore, we used a double-blind, counterbalanced, within-subject design to investigate the modulatory effects of the partial 5-HT1A agonist buspirone (20mg p.o.) and the non-hallucinogenic 5-HT2A/1A agonist ergotamine (3mg p.o.) on psilocybin-induced (170 µg/kg p.o.) psychological effects in two groups (n=19, n=17) of healthy human subjects. Psychological effects were assessed using the Altered State of Consciousness (5D-ASC) rating scale. Buspirone significantly reduced the 5D-ASC main scale score for Visionary Restructuralization (VR) (p<0.001), which was mostly driven by a reduction of the VR item cluster scores for elementary and complex visual hallucinations. Further, buspirone also reduced the main scale score for Oceanic Boundlessness (OB) including derealisation and depersonalisation phenomena at a trend level (p=0.062), whereas ergotamine did not show any effects on the psilocybin-induced 5D-ASC main scale scores. The present finding demonstrates that buspirone exerts inhibitory effects on psilocybin-induced effects, presumably via 5-HT1A receptor activation, an interaction between 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors, or both.

In the first randomized controlled trial of ketamine using an anesthetic control condition, we tested ketamine's acute effects on explicit suicidal cognition and a performance-based index of implicit suicidal cognition (Implicit Association Test; IAT) previously linked to suicidal behavior. METHOD: Symptomatic patients with treatment-resistant unipolar major depression (inadequate response to ≥3 antidepressants) were assessed using a composite index of explicit suicidal ideation (Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation, Montgomery-Asberg Rating Scale suicide item, Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms suicide item) and the IAT to assess suicidality implicitly. Measures were taken at baseline and 24 hr following a single subanesthetic dose of ketamine (n = 36) or midazolam (n = 21), a psychoactive placebo agent selected for its similar, rapid anesthetic effects. Twenty four hours postinfusion, explicit suicidal cognition was significantly reduced in the ketamine but not the midazolam group. RESULTS: Fifty three percent of ketamine-treated patients scored zero on all three explicit suicide measures at 24 hr, compared with 24% of the midazolam group (χ(2) = 4.6; P = .03). Implicit associations between self- and escape-related words were reduced following ketamine (P = .01; d = .58) but not midazolam (P = .68; d = .09). Ketamine-specific decreases in explicit suicidal cognition were largest in patients with elevated suicidal cognition at baseline, and were mediated by decreases in nonsuicide-related depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous ketamine produces rapid reductions in suicidal cognition over and above active placebo.

7077,"Effects of intravenous ketamine on explicit and implicit measures of suicidality in treatment-resistant depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Intravenous ketamine has shown rapid antidepressant effects in early trials, making it a potentially attractive candidate for depressed patients at imminent risk of suicide. The Implicit Association Test (IAT), a performance-based measure of association between concepts, may have utility in suicide assessment. METHODS: Twenty-six patients with treatment-resistant depression were assessed using the suicidality item of the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-SI) 2 hours before and 24 hours following a single subanesthetic dose of intravenous ketamine. Ten patients also completed IATs assessing implicit suicidal associations at comparable time points. In a second study, nine patients received thrice-weekly ketamine infusions over a 12-day period. RESULTS: Twenty-four hours after a single infusion, MADRS-SI scores were reduced on average by 2.08 points on a 0 to 6 scale (p < .001; d = 1.37), and 81% of patients received a rating of 0 or 1 postinfusion. Implicit suicidal associations were also reduced following ketamine (p = .003; d = 1.36), with reductions correlated across implicit and explicit measures. MADRS-SI reductions were sustained for 12 days by repeated-dose ketamine (p < .001; d = 2.42).

7083,"Exploring the effect of microdosing psychedelics on creativity in an open-label natural setting.^\nINTRODUCTION: Taking microdoses (a mere fraction of normal doses) of psychedelic substances, such as truffles, recently gained popularity, as it allegedly has multiple beneficial effects including creativity and problem-solving performance, potentially through targeting serotonergic 5-HT(2A) receptors and promoting cognitive flexibility, crucial to creative thinking. Nevertheless, enhancing effects of microdosing remain anecdotal, and in the absence of quantitative research on microdosing psychedelics, it is impossible to draw definitive conclusions on that matter. Here, our main aim was to quantitatively explore the cognitive-enhancing potential of microdosing psychedelics in healthy adults. METHODS: During a microdosing event organized by the Dutch Psychedelic Society, we examined the effects of psychedelic truffles (which were later analyzed to quantify active psychedelic alkaloids) on two creativity-related problem-solving tasks: the Picture Concept Task assessing convergent thinking and the Alternative Uses Task assessing divergent thinking. A short version of the Ravens Progressive Matrices task assessed potential changes in fluid intelligence. We tested once before taking a microdose and once while the effects were expected to be manifested. RESULTS: We found that both convergent and divergent thinking performance was improved after a non-blinded microdose, whereas fluid intelligence was unaffected. CONCLUSION: While this study provides quantitative support for the cognitive-enhancing properties of microdosing psychedelics, future research has to confirm these preliminary findings in more rigorous placebo-controlled study designs. Based on these preliminary results, we speculate that psychedelics might affect cognitive metacontrol policies by optimizing the balance between cognitive persistence and flexibility. We hope this study will motivate future microdosing studies with more controlled designs to test this hypothesis.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.027297239750623703, 0.014969863928854465, 0.005582955665886402, 0.007864151149988174, 0.005203475244343281, 0.0064955828711390495, 0.005548177752643824, 0.004257377702742815, 0.0054090493358671665, 0.010260870680212975, 0.006970476359128952, 0.006330700591206551, 0.03056882508099079, 0.9902295470237732]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]"
7158,"MDMA (ecstasy) use is associated with reduced BOLD signal change during semantic recognition in abstinent human polydrug users: A preliminary fMRI study.^\n3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) users have impaired verbal memory, and voxel-based morphometry has shown decreased grey matter in Brodmann area (BA) 18, 21 and 45. Because these regions play a role in verbal memory, we hypothesized that MDMA users would show altered brain activation in these areas during performance of a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task that probed semantic verbal memory. Polysubstance users enriched for MDMA exposure participated in a semantic memory encoding and recognition fMRI task that activated left BA 9, 18, 21/22 and 45. Primary outcomes were percent blood oxygen level-dependent signal change in left BA 9, 18, 21/22 and 45, accuracy and response time. During semantic recognition, lifetime MDMA use was associated with decreased activation in left BA 9, 18 and 21/22 but not 45. This was partly influenced by contributions from cannabis and cocaine use. MDMA exposure was not associated with accuracy or response time during the semantic recognition task. During semantic recognition, MDMA exposure was associated with reduced regional brain activation in regions mediating verbal memory. These findings partially overlap with previous structural evidence for reduced grey matter in MDMA users and may, in part, explain the consistent verbal memory impairments observed in other studies of MDMA users.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0]","[0.024297231808304787, 0.012112321332097054, 0.012332592159509659, 0.013142491690814495, 0.014410462230443954, 0.03846648335456848, 0.018324315547943115, 0.02033989131450653, 0.01620931178331375, 0.23474277555942535, 0.02437658980488777, 0.011237019672989845, 0.9764461517333984, 0.9772244691848755]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0]"
7313,"Human pharmacology of ayahuasca: subjective and cardiovascular effects, monoamine metabolite excretion, and pharmacokinetics.^\nThe effects of the South American psychotropic beverage ayahuasca on subjective and cardiovascular variables and urine monoamine metabolite excretion were evaluated, together with the drug's pharmacokinetic profile, in a double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial. This pharmacologically complex tea, commonly obtained from Banisteriopsis caapi and Psychotria viridis, combines N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), an orally labile psychedelic agent showing 5-hydroxytryptamine2A agonist activity, with monoamine oxidase (MAO)-inhibiting beta-carboline alkaloids (harmine, harmaline, and tetrahydroharmine). Eighteen volunteers with prior experience in the use of psychedelics received single oral doses of encapsulated freeze-dried ayahuasca (0.6 and 0.85 mg of DMT/kg of body weight) and placebo. Ayahuasca produced significant subjective effects, peaking between 1.5 and 2 h, involving perceptual modifications and increases in ratings of positive mood and activation. Diastolic blood pressure showed a significant increase at the high dose (9 mm Hg at 75 min), whereas systolic blood pressure and heart rate were moderately and nonsignificantly increased. Cmax values for DMT after the low and high ayahuasca doses were 12.14 ng/ml and 17.44 ng/ml, respectively. Tmax (median) was observed at 1.5 h after both doses. The Tmax for DMT coincided with the peak of subjective effects. Drug administration increased urinary normetanephrine excretion, but, contrary to the typical MAO-inhibitor effect profile, deaminated monoamine metabolite levels were not decreased. This and the negligible harmine plasma levels found suggest a predominantly peripheral (gastrointestinal and liver) site of action for harmine. MAO inhibition at this level would suffice to prevent first-pass metabolism of DMT and allow its access to systemic circulation and the central nervous system.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.022808879613876343, 0.014225147664546967, 0.005769755225628614, 0.006866719573736191, 0.00468460563570261, 0.006283015012741089, 0.005281812511384487, 0.004015561193227768, 0.005045526660978794, 0.010553963482379913, 0.008278755471110344, 0.006179706659168005, 0.03399275615811348, 0.9887257218360901]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]"

Methods: KODIAC is a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled clinical study which evaluated the effects of an intravenous dose of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) compared with placebo and escalating dose of escitalopram in patients diagnosed with MDD by a specialized psychiatrist. The primary outcome was depression as per the Brief Edinburgh Depression Scale (BEDS) 3 weeks post‐intervention. This study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04471818). Results: Currently, 50% of the calculated sample has been accrued. Eight patients (n=4 controls; n=4 experimental) completed the study. Baseline characteristics were similar among both study groups, as well as baseline BEDS scores. Mean BEDS scores showed improvement as early as 1‐week post‐intervention. At three weeks post intervention, patients included in the experimental arm had a significant reduction in mean BEDS depression scores compared with patients in the control arm (3 [SD: 2.160] vs. 11.75 [SD:3.594]; p=0.006). The most common adverse event was post‐infusion drowsiness and nausea. No serious adverse events were reported. Conclusions: Preliminary results from this study highlight that ketamine is a rapid onset and robust potentializing anti‐depressant for patients with cancer and MDD undergoing palliative care.

7719,"Sustained reductions in headache burden after the limited administration of low dose psilocybin in migraine and cluster headache: results from two preliminary studies.^\nBackground: Headache disorders maintain top worldwide disability ratings, urging the continued investigation of novel targets and mechanisms of treatment. Anecdotal evidence suggests that psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and other select indoleamine 5‐hydroxytryptamine 2A (5‐HT2A) receptor ligands confer sustained therapeutic benefit in cluster and migraine headache, though controlled studies are lacking. We sought to carry out the first controlled investigations of the effects and safety of psilocybin in these headache disorders. Methods: Two exploratory clinical trials were carried out in adult males and females with migraine or cluster headache (twelve each). The migraine design was a double‐blind, placebocontrolled, cross‐over study and the cluster design was a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study. Migraine subjects received single administrations of oral placebo (microcrystalline cellulose) and psilocybin (0.143 mg/kg) two weeks apart. Cluster subjects were randomized to receive a pulse regimen of three administrations of either psilocybin (0.143 mg/ kg) or placebo, each administration separated by approximately 5 days. Headache diaries, in which subjects documented headache attacks, began two weeks before the first test day and ended two weeks after the second test day for migraine subjects and two months after the last test day for cluster subjects. Physiological and psychological drug effects were monitored during sessionsand several follow‐up contacts with subjects were carried out to assure safety of study procedures. Ten subjects in each the migraine and cluster studies were included in the final analysis. Results: Over the 2‐week period after single drug administration, the reduction in weekly migraine days from baseline was significantly greater after psilocybin [‐1.65 (95% CI: ‐2.53 to ‐0.77) days/week] than after placebo [‐0.15 (‐1.13 to 0.83) days/ week; p = 0.003, t(9) = 4.11; effect size ‐1.15]. Over the 3‐week period after initiating the pulse regimen, the reduction in weekly cluster attacks from baseline was greater with psilocybin [‐6.03 (‐9.96 to ‐2.10)] than with placebo [+1.17 (‐2.76 to 5.10); p = 0.017, t(8) = 2.99; effect size ‐1.89]. In neither study did the rating of psychedelic effects during acute psilocybin exposure correlate with the change in headache burden. Psilocybin was welltolerated in both studies and there were no unexpected or serious adverse events. Conclusions: These two exploratory controlled trials showed that limited administration of a low oral dose of psilocybin has sustained therapeutic effects in migraine and cluster headache. These findings validate the potential value of psilocybin in headache research and medicine. That the reductions in headache burden were not correlated with acute psychedelic effects in these studies urges the consideration of the several neurobiological functions common to both headache pathology and the known actions of select 5‐HT2A receptor ligands as potential sources of therapeutic effects in headache.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.1248103603720665, 0.02033267170190811, 0.02961971051990986, 0.02575562708079815, 0.01185675710439682, 0.019925961270928383, 0.01407935842871666, 0.009296410717070103, 0.014190612360835075, 0.02363734133541584, 0.6152063608169556, 0.014667789451777935, 0.05680225044488907, 0.24845518171787262]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
7816,"Coping style and ecstasy use motives as predictors of current mood symptoms in ecstasy users.^\nBackground: Elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms during childhood and adolescence have been associated with greater risk of later ecstasy use. Ecstasy users have reported using ecstasy to reduce depression or worry, or to escape. While these findings suggest that some people use ecstasy as a form of self-medication, limited research has been conducted examining the relationship between affective symptoms, coping styles and drug use motives in ecstasy users. This cross-sectional study aimed to determine if coping style and/or ecstasy use motives are associated with current mood symptoms in ecstasy users. Methods: A community sample (n=184) of 18-35. year olds who had taken ecstasy at least once in the past 12. months completed self-report measures of depression, anxiety, ecstasy use motives and coping styles. Timeline followback methods were used to collect information on lifetime ecstasy, recent drug use and life stress. Trauma exposure was measured using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Trauma List. Results: Coping motives for ecstasy use and an emotion-focused coping style were significantly associated with current depressive and anxiety symptoms. Emotion-focused coping mediated the relationship between a history of trauma and current anxiety symptoms and moderated the relationship between recent stressful life events and current depressive symptoms. Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of interventions targeting motives for ecstasy use, and providing coping skills training for managing stressful life events among people with co-occurring depressive/anxiety symptoms and ecstasy use. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0]","[0.018224451690912247, 0.011287052184343338, 0.00952483806759119, 0.008768455125391483, 0.00844638142734766, 0.021238796412944794, 0.010850746184587479, 0.013091006316244602, 0.00967870932072401, 0.07136447727680206, 0.016667407006025314, 0.008634458296000957, 0.9623873829841614, 0.9847772121429443]","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
7980,"Prolonged ketamine infusion modulates limbic connectivity and induces sustained remission of treatment-resistant depression.^\nKetamine produces a rapid antidepressant response in over 50% of adults with treatment-resistant depression. A long infusion of ketamine may provide durable remission of depressive symptoms, but the safety, efficacy, and neurobiological correlates are unknown. In this open-label, proof-of-principle study, adults with treatment-resistant depression (N = 23) underwent a 96-h infusion of intravenous ketamine (0.15 mg/kg/h titrated toward 0.6 mg/kg/h). Clonidine was co-administered to reduce psychotomimetic effects. We measured clinical response for 8 weeks post-infusion. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess functional connectivity in patients pre- and 2 weeks post-infusion and in matched non-depressed controls (N = 27). We hypothesized that responders to therapy would demonstrate response-dependent connectivity changes while all subjects would show treatment-dependent connectivity changes. Most participants completed infusion (21/23; mean final dose 0.54 mg/kg/h, SD 0.13). The infusion was well tolerated with minimal cognitive and psychotomimetic side effects. Depressive symptoms were markedly reduced (MADRS 29 ± 4 at baseline to 9 ± 8 one day post-infusion), which was sustained at 2 weeks (13 ± 8) and 8 weeks (15 ± 8). Imaging demonstrated a response-dependent decrease in hyperconnectivity of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex to the default mode network, and a treatment-dependent decrease in hyperconnectivity within the limbic system (hippocampus, amygdala, medial thalamus, nucleus accumbens). In exploratory analyses, connectivity was increased between the limbic system and frontal areas, and smaller right hippocampus volume at baseline predicted larger MADRS change. A single prolonged infusion of ketamine provides a tolerated, rapid, and sustained response in treatment-resistant depression and normalizes depression-related hyperconnectivity in the limbic system and frontal lobe.

8138,"Attributions for psychobiological changes in ecstasy/MDMA and other polydrug users.^\nEcstasy [3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)] use has been associated with a number of psychopathological problems. However, research suggests that reported symptoms might be associated more with heavy polydrug use in general rather than ecstasy per se. The current study aimed to determine the role of other drug use in reports of long-term effects by some ecstasy-polydrug users. Problematic ecstasy users (n = 53), reporting problems which they attributed to ecstasy use, were compared with non-problematic ecstasy users (n = 62), polydrug (n = 62) and alcohol/nicotine using controls (n = 111). Drug use was recorded, and positive and negative life changes were assessed along with which previous drug use, if any, they attributed these changes too. Both ecstasy groups reported higher drug use compared with polydrug controls. Polydrug and ecstasy users more often reported life changes compared with non-drug users, and ecstasy users appeared to experience more life changes than polydrug users, with problematic ecstasy users experiencing most alterations. Ecstasy users reported changes more to a combination of drugs than to one specific drug, suggesting that polydrug use in these groups has an impact on their life experiences. These findings emphasise that research into the psychological effects of ecstasy should not underestimate the role of other polydrug use. © 2009 British Association for Psychopharmacology.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0]","[0.04819002002477646, 0.01637563668191433, 0.022552277892827988, 0.02461893856525421, 0.031912170350551605, 0.09120456874370575, 0.03874524310231209, 0.043062496930360794, 0.03550638630986214, 0.6188387274742126, 0.04575192183256149, 0.020654041320085526, 0.9751160144805908, 0.9410601258277893]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0]"
8295,"Ketamine-induced disruption of verbal self-monitoring linked to superior temporal activation.^\nINTRODUCTION: Misattribution of distorted self-generated speech in patients with schizophrenia has been associated with increased lateral temporal activation. As a pharmacological model of schizophrenia, we tested whether ketamine would induce the same effects in healthy individuals. METHODS: Participants were 8 healthy male volunteers who were naïve to ketamine (mean age: 28 years). Ketamine (0.23 mg/kg bolus followed by 0.64 mg/kg/h) and placebo infusions were administered in a double-blind, randomised order, during 2 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sessions. Each fMRI session consisted of a verbal self-monitoring task in which auditory feedback was experimentally modified. RESULTS: Ketamine was associated with psychotic and dissociative symptoms. Participants made more misattributions of distorted self-generated speech (P < 0.02) during the ketamine infusion. Ketamine led to reduced activation in the left superior temporal cortex during self-distorted speech, regardless of whether the speech was identified correctly or not, as compared to the placebo infusion. Misidentification of speech that had been distorted was not associated with any increase in brain activation in during the placebo infusion, however ketamine-induced misattributions were associated with a relative increase in left superior temporal cortex activation. DISCUSSION: These data are consistent with the notion that self-monitoring impairments underlie psychotic symptoms and suggest that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor dysfunction may mediate self-monitoring deficits and psychotic phenomena in schizophrenia.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.027894476428627968, 0.017128845676779747, 0.005998715292662382, 0.007857060059905052, 0.00471613509580493, 0.005855503957718611, 0.005228625610470772, 0.004224661272019148, 0.005205726716667414, 0.009677613154053688, 0.007307038176804781, 0.006497771013528109, 0.02414347417652607, 0.9877939224243164]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]"

This study examined differences on Big Five personality dimensions between a population sample of non-hard drug using Dutch adolescents and young adults (n = 265), and a sample of young people visiting house parties, including both MDMA- and non-MDMA-users (n = 541). Results showed that 71% of the party visitors indicated using MDMA. Group differences were found on conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism-emotional stability, but not on resourcefulness-openness to experience. Compared to the non-hard drug using National respondents, MDMA-using party visitors reported higher levels of extraversion and both MDMA and non-MDMA-using partygoers showed less conscientiousness. Non-MDMA-using partygoers reported less agreeableness and emotional stability than National Sample respondents.

8578,"The external validity of results derived from ecstasy users recruited using purposive sampling strategies.^\nThis study sought to compare the patterns and correlates of 'recent' and 'regular' ecstasy use estimated on the basis of two datasets generated in 2001 in New South Wales, Australia, from a probability and a non-probability sample. The first was the National Drug Strategy Household Survey (NDSHS), a multistage probability sample of the general population; and the second was the Illicit Drug Reporting System (IDRS) Party Drugs Module, for which regular ecstasy users were recruited using purposive sampling strategies. NDSHS recent ecstasy users (any use in the preceding 12 months) were compared on a range of demographic and drug use variables to NDSHS regular ecstasy users (at least monthly use in the preceding 12 months) and purposively sampled regular ecstasy users (at least monthly use in the preceding 6 months). The demographic characteristics of the three samples were consistent. Among all three, the mean age was approximately 25 years, and a majority (60%) of subjects were male, relatively well-educated, and currently employed or studying. Patterns of ecstasy use were similar among the three samples, although compared to recent users, regular users were likely to report more frequent use of ecstasy. All samples were characterised by extensive polydrug use, although the two samples of regular ecstasy users reported higher rates of other illicit drug use than the sample of recent users. The similarities between the demographic and drug use characteristics of the samples are striking, and suggest that, at least in NSW, purposive sampling that seeks to draw from a wide cross-section of users and to sample a relatively large number of individuals, can give rise to samples of ecstasy users that may be considered sufficiently representative to reasonably warrant the drawing of inferences relating to the entire population. These findings may partially offset concerns that purposive samples of ecstasy users are likely to remain a primary source of ecstasy-related information. © 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

8703,"The therapeutic potential of psilocybin: a systematic review.^\nINTRODUCTION: Psychedelic drugs were used quite extensively before their prohibition in 1968 which delayed research. However, since the 1990s, studies on the potential therapeutic benefits of psychedelics have rapidly increased. AREAS COVERED: This systematic review provides an overview of the clinical effects of psilocybin in the treatment of a variety of mental disorders. Only (randomized) clinical trials were selected. A total of 11 studies (15 publications) were selected, including seven randomized controlled trials (eight publications) and four single arm open-label studies (seven publications). In total, 488 patients were included in the selected studies: 333 patients treated with psilocybin and 155 patients treated with (active) placebo. In nine studies, psychotherapeutic support was provided as an integral part of the psilocybin treatment. The findings of these studies collectively show that psilocybin has a positive benefit-risk balance in the treatment of various mental disorders with an immediate and prolonged effect following 1-3 doses of psilocybin and a few (serious) adverse events. EXPERT OPINION: Psilocybin - mostly combined with psychotherapy or psychotherapeutic support - shows a promise as a treatment for various (treatment-resistant) mental disorders. Larger double-blind RCTs with objective (long-term) outcomes are needed to confirm these findings before standard clinical use of psilocybin can be considered.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.8114563822746277, 0.165494903922081, 0.013778986409306526, 0.01449473574757576, 0.010075741447508335, 0.007361538242548704, 0.004292475525289774, 0.0046685668639838696, 0.0055817193351686, 0.0074150944128632545, 0.0048108347691595554, 0.008302003145217896, 0.021474940702319145, 0.8055259585380554]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
8905,"Differential psychopathology and patterns of cerebral glucose utilisation produced by (S)- and (R)-ketamine in healthy volunteers using positron emission tomography (PET).^\nUntil recently, racemic ketamine (S-ketamine/R-ketamine = 50:50) has been used to study NMDA receptor hypofunction in relation to pathophysiological models of schizophrenia. Ketamine given to normal humans in subanesthetic doses produces a model psychosis including both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. More recently it has been shown that at subanesthetic doses the pure (S)- and (R)-ketamine enantiomeres interact differently with the NMDA and sigma receptor sites in human brain. It was found that (S)-ketamine binds with a 3-4 time higher affinity to the PCP binding site of the NMDA receptor than (R)-ketamine, and that at these concentrations (R)-ketamine interacts also weakly with the sigma receptor sites, where (S)-ketamine binds only negligibly. To further investigate the role of NMDA-receptor mediated neurotransmission in schizophrenic psychosis, the effects of pure (S)- and (R)-ketamine enantiomeres on brain energy metabolism in normal humans using positron emission tomography and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) are reported here. Psychotomimetic doses of (S)-ketamine increased cerebral metabolic rates of glucose (CMRglu) markedly in the frontal cortex including the anterior cingulate, parietal and left sensorimotor cortex, and in the thalamus. The metabolic changes in the frontal and left temporal cortex correlated with ego-disintegration and hallucinatory phenomena. Equimolar doses of (R)-ketamine tended to decrease CMRglu across brain regions and significantly suppressed CMRglu in the temporomedial cortex and left insula. (R)-ketamine did not produce psychotic symptoms, but a state of relaxation. The (S)-ketamine-induced metabolic hyperfrontality appears to parallel similar metabolic findings in acute psychotic schizophrenic patients and encourages further investigations of glutamatergic disturbances in schizophrenia.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.02343495562672615, 0.014072482474148273, 0.005894876085221767, 0.007889893837273121, 0.005006405990570784, 0.006533539388328791, 0.005650151055306196, 0.004300378262996674, 0.005394912324845791, 0.01096042525023222, 0.00794477853924036, 0.0062268078327178955, 0.029725728556513786, 0.9898498058319092]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]"
8970,"Altered Insula Connectivity under MDMA.^\nRecent work with noninvasive human brain imaging has started to investigate the effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on large-scale patterns of brain activity. MDMA, a potent monoamine-releaser with particularly pronounced serotonin- releasing properties, has unique subjective effects that include: marked positive mood, pleasant/unusual bodily sensations and pro-social, empathic feelings. However, the neurobiological basis for these effects is not properly understood, and the present analysis sought to address this knowledge gap. To do this, we administered MDMA-HCl (100 mg p.o.) and, separately, placebo (ascorbic acid) in a randomized, double-blind, repeated-measures design with twenty-five healthy volunteers undergoing fMRI scanning. We then employed a measure of global resting-state functional brain connectivity and follow-up seed-to-voxel analysis to the fMRI data we acquired. Results revealed decreased right insula/salience network functional connectivity under MDMA. Furthermore, these decreases in right insula/salience network connectivity correlated with baseline trait anxiety and acute experiences of altered bodily sensations under MDMA. The present findings highlight insular disintegration (ie, compromised salience network membership) as a neurobiological signature of the MDMA experience, and relate this brain effect to trait anxiety and acutely altered bodily sensations-both of which are known to be associated with insular functioning.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.02651927061378956, 0.016344228759407997, 0.0057327598333358765, 0.008089955896139145, 0.004954495932906866, 0.006133561488240957, 0.005604115314781666, 0.004256170708686113, 0.005179904401302338, 0.010041503235697746, 0.007222748827189207, 0.00616687024012208, 0.027904292568564415, 0.9893446564674377]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]"

Clinical studies are currently being conducted around the world on the use of this substance in the treatment of PTSD and alcoholism. However, little demographic information is available on users who use the substance for recreational purposes. The aim was to determine basic demographic and helath characteristics with validated tools. METHODS: The authors prepared an original questionnaire on the demography of MDMA users and combined it with the General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The survey was sent to Polish MDMA users via the Internet. RESULTS: 304 responses were received from people over 18 years of age. MDMA is widespread among young adults, in many different places of residence and regardless of gender. The users take MDMA in both pill and crystal form and very rarely test drugs bought from a dealer. Most users feel that MDMA has had a good impact on their lives.

9173,"Acute and Longer-Term Outcomes Using Ketamine as a Clinical Treatment at the Yale Psychiatric Hospital.^\nOBJECTIVE: Ketamine has emerged as a rapid-acting antidepressant, though controversy remains whether sufficient data exist to justify its use outside of research protocols. In October 2014, the authors' institution began providing ketamine as an off-label therapy on a case-by-case basis for patients unable to participate in research protocols. Here, the participant experience during 29 months of providing ketamine as a clinical treatment for severe and treatment-resistant mood disorders through February 2017 is described. METHODS: Patients were initially treated with a single- or double-infusion protocol (0.5 mg/kg for 40 minutes intravenously) and were later transitioned to a 4-infusion protocol over 2 weeks. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients received ketamine, with 518 total infusions performed. A subset of 44 patients with mood disorders initiated the 4-infusion protocol, of whom 45.5% responded and 27.3% remitted by the fourth infusion. A subsample (n = 14) received ketamine on a long-term basis, ranging from 12 to 45 total treatments, over a course of 14 to 126 weeks. No evidence was found of cognitive decline, increased proclivity to delusions, or emergence of symptoms consistent with cystitis in this subsample. CONCLUSIONS: In general, ketamine infusions were tolerated well. The response and remission rates in this clinical sample were lower than those observed in some research protocols.

9578,"Changes in synaptic markers after administration of ketamine or psychedelics: a systematic scoping review.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine and psychedelics have abuse liability. They can also induce ""transformative experiences"" where individuals experience enhanced states of awareness. This enhanced awareness can lead to changes in preexisting behavioral patterns which could be beneficial in the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs). Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that ketamine and psychedelics may alter markers associated with synaptic density, and that these changes may underlie effects such as sensitization, conditioned place preference, drug self-administration, and verbal memory performance. In this scoping review, we examined studies that measured synaptic markers in animals and humans after exposure to ketamine and/or psychedelics. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted following PRISMA guidelines, through PubMed, EBSCO, Scopus, and Web of Science, based on a published protocol (Open Science Framework, DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/43FQ9). Both in vivo and in vitro studies were included. Studies on the following synaptic markers were included: dendritic structural changes, PSD-95, synapsin-1, synaptophysin-1, synaptotagmin-1, and SV2A. RESULTS: Eighty-four studies were included in the final analyses. Seventy-one studies examined synaptic markers following ketamine treatment, nine examined psychedelics, and four examined both. Psychedelics included psilocybin/psilocin, lysergic acid diethylamide, N,N-dimethyltryptamine, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine, and ibogaine/noribogaine. Mixed findings regarding synaptic changes in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) have been reported when ketamine was administered in a single dose under basal conditions. Similar mixed findings were seen under basal conditions in studies that used repeated administration of ketamine. However, studies that examined animals during stressful conditions found that a single dose of ketamine counteracted stress-related reductions in synaptic markers in the hippocampus and PFC. Repeated administration of ketamine also counteracted stress effects in the hippocampus. Psychedelics generally increased synaptic markers, but results were more consistently positive for certain agents. CONCLUSION: Ketamine and psychedelics can increase synaptic markers under certain conditions. Heterogeneous findings may relate to methodological differences, agents administered (or different formulations of the same agent), sex, and type of markers. Future studies could address seemingly mixed results by using meta-analytical approaches or study designs that more fully consider individual differences.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.10575099289417267, 0.019875729456543922, 0.006955942139029503, 0.008077628910541534, 0.008313930593430996, 0.01705620251595974, 0.0062056370079517365, 0.005531019065529108, 0.0056224726140499115, 0.013254871591925621, 0.007182017900049686, 0.005421224981546402, 0.043443430215120316, 0.9780468344688416]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]"
