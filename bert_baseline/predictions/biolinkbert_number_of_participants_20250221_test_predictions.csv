2439,"The psychedelic afterglow phenomenon: a systematic review of subacute effects of classic serotonergic psychedelics.^\nBackground:Classic serotonergic psychedelics have anecdotally been reported to show a characteristic pattern of subacute effects that persist after the acute effects of the substance have subsided. These transient effects, sometimes labeled as the 'psychedelic afterglow', have been suggested to be associated with enhanced effectiveness of psychotherapeutic interventions in the subacute period. Objectives:This systematic review provides an overview of subacute effects of psychedelics. Methods:Electronic databases (MEDLINE, Web of Science Core Collection) were searched for studies that assessed the effects of psychedelics (LSD, psilocybin, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, mescaline, or ayahuasca) on psychological outcome measures and subacute adverse effects in human adults between 1950 and August 2021, occurring between 1 day and 1 month after drug use. Results:Forty-eight studies including a total number of 1,774 participants were eligible for review. Taken together, the following subacute effects were observed: reductions in different psychopathological symptoms; increases in wellbeing, mood, mindfulness, social measures, spirituality, and positive behavioral changes; mixed changes in personality/values/attitudes, and creativity/flexibility. Subacute adverse effects comprised a wide range of complaints, including headaches, sleep disturbances, and individual cases of increased psychological distress. Discussion:Results support narrative reports of a subacute psychedelic 'afterglow' phenomenon comprising potentially beneficial changes in the perception of self, others, and the environment. Subacute adverse events were mild to severe, and no serious adverse events were reported. Many studies, however, lacked a standardized assessment of adverse effects. Future studies are needed to investigate the role of possible moderator variables and to reveal if and how positive effects from the subacute window may consolidate into long-term mental health benefits.",10,"[0.0026505785062909126, 0.0049990261904895306, 0.01278085820376873, 0.00337064266204834, 0.0019359654979780316, 0.03430310636758804, 0.0014202436432242393, 0.0019748355261981487, 0.014202585443854332, 0.004046987742185593, 0.918315052986145]",10
624,"Perceived Benefits of MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy beyond Symptom Reduction: Qualitative Follow-Up Study of a Clinical Trial for Individuals with Treatment-Resistant PTSD.^\nWe present select findings from a long-term follow-up qualitative study of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for veterans, firefighters, and police officers suffering from chronic, treatment-resistant PTSD. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted at participants' one-year follow-up after a recently completed phase 2 clinical trial. Available interviews from 19 of 24 participants were analyzed. This qualitative analysis sought to complement, clarify, and expand upon the quantitative findings obtained from the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-IV) and supported by the Long-Term Follow-Up (LTFU) Questionnaire. Pertinent data from interview transcripts were coded and analyzed using an interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) methodological framework. We explore prominent thematic elements from participant accounts to better understand the outcomes experienced in this trial. All participants reported experiencing lasting personal benefits and enhanced quality of life that extend beyond quantifiable symptom reduction. We explore a range of treatment benefits beyond symptom reduction to highlight the utility of qualitative investigations of the process and effects of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.

1710,"Electrophysiological evidence of serotonergic impairment in long-term MDMA (""Ecstasy"") users.^\nObjective: ""Ecstasy,"" or 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), causes long-term impairment to the serotonin (5-HT) system in rats, dogs, and nonhuman primates. 5-HT dysfunction has also been observed in human recreational users of the drug, but whether 5-HT dysfunction in humans is caused by MDMA has not been established, since dysfunction may have preceded MDMA exposure. This ambiguity about causation is particularly important in MDMA research, because 5-HT deficiency is a predictor of risky behavior. Method: The 5-HT function of 22 long-term MDMA users was compared to that of 20 drug-naive comparison subjects and 19 cannabis users. 5-HT function was assessed with the intensity dependence paradigm, a tool that measures 5-HT-related attenuation of neural response to auditory stimuli (measured with EEG). Results: Long-term MDMA users exhibited 5-HT dysfunction, relative to both cannabis users and drug-naive comparison subjects. This dysfunction was related to total MDMA consumption (after removing the effect of frequency of use) but not to frequency of use (after removing the effect of total consumption). Conclusions: These data show that 5-HT dysfunction occurs in MDMA users, is related to users' MDMA consumption, and is independent of cannabis use. The results do not suggest that self-medication explains this relationship, because the deficit was related to total MDMA consumption but not frequency of consumption. The results are thus consistent with the thesis that MDMA consumption causes 5-HT impairment in humans.",4,"[0.0024118393193930387, 0.004396022297441959, 0.009700234979391098, 0.019412411376833916, 0.9089184999465942, 0.003155789338052273, 0.03796454146504402, 0.003495251527056098, 0.006121809594333172, 0.0018805112922564149, 0.00254307989962399]",6
8031,"Associations between lifetime classic psychedelic use and markers of physical health.^\nBackground: In recent years, there has been significant research on the mental health effects of classic psychedelic use, but there is very little evidence on how classic psychedelics might influence physical health. Aims: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the associations between lifetime classic psychedelic use and markers of physical health. Methods: Using data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2015-2018) with 171,766 (unweighted) adults aged 18 or above in the United States, the current study examined the associations between lifetime classic psychedelic use and three markers of physical health (self-reported overall health, body mass index, and heart condition and/or cancer in the past 12 months) while controlling for a range of covariates. Results: Respondents who reported having tried a classic psychedelic at least once in their lifetime had significantly higher odds of greater self-reported overall health and significantly lower odds of being overweight or obese versus having a normal weight. The association between lifetime classic psychedelic use and having a heart condition and/or cancer in the past 12 months approached conventional levels of significance, with lower odds of having a heart condition and/or cancer in the past 12 months for respondents who had tried a classic psychedelic at least once. Conclusion: The results of the present study suggest that classic psychedelics may be beneficial to physical health.

8372,"Ketamine improves short-term plasticity in depression by enhancing sensitivity to prediction errors.^\nMajor depressive disorder negatively impacts the sensitivity and adaptability of the brain's predictive coding framework. The current electroencephalography study into the antidepressant properties of ketamine investigated the downstream effects of ketamine on predictive coding and short-term plasticity in thirty patients with depression using the auditory roving mismatch negativity (rMMN). The rMMN paradigm was run 3-4 h after a single 0.44 mg/kg intravenous dose of ketamine or active placebo (remifentanil infused to a target plasma concentration of 1.7 ng/mL) in order to measure the neural effects of ketamine in the period when an improvement in depressive symptoms emerges. Depression symptomatology was measured using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS); 70% of patients demonstrated at least a 50% reduction their MADRS global score. Ketamine significantly increased the MMN and P3a event related potentials, directly contrasting literature demonstrating ketamine's acute attenuation of the MMN. This effect was only reliable when all repetitions of the post-deviant tone were used. Dynamic causal modelling showed greater modulation of forward connectivity in response to a deviant tone between right primary auditory cortex and right inferior temporal cortex, which significantly correlated with antidepressant response to ketamine at 24 h. This is consistent with the hypothesis that ketamine increases sensitivity to unexpected sensory input and restores deficits in sensitivity to prediction error that are hypothesised to underlie depression. However, the lack of repetition suppression evident in the MMN evoked data compared to studies of healthy adults suggests that, at least within the short term, ketamine does not improve deficits in adaptive internal model calibration.",3,"[0.0013337230775505304, 0.0011413776082918048, 0.00190527003724128, 0.978871762752533, 0.008875119499862194, 0.0003848378546535969, 0.0013500071363523602, 0.0005898573435842991, 0.0015579105820506811, 0.002809230936691165, 0.0011809732532128692]",3

However, this drug also has transient cardiovascular stimulatory effects, and there are limited data about potential predictors of these cardiovascular effects. METHODS: A total of 135 patients with unipolar and bipolar depression received a total of 741 ketamine infusions (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min). Blood pressure and pulse were monitored every 10 min during the infusions and 30 min after the infusions. Depressive, psychotomimetic and dissociative symptom severity was assessed at baseline and 4 hours after each infusion. RESULTS: The maximum blood pressure and pulse values were observed at 30-40 min during infusions. The largest mean systolic/diastolic blood pressure increases were 7.4/6.0 mmHg, and the largest mean pulse increase was 1.9 beats per min. No significant change in blood pressure and pulse was found in the second to sixth infusions compared with the first infusion. Patients who were older (age⩾50 years), hypertensive and receiving infusions while exhibiting dissociative symptoms showed greater maximal changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure than patients who were younger (age<50 years), normotensive and without dissociative symptoms (all p < 0.05). Hypertensive patients had less elevation of pulse than normotensive patients (p < 0.05). Ketamine dosage was positively correlated with changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (all p < 0.05).

4848,"Clonazepam treatment of lysergic acid diethylamide-induced hallucinogen persisting perception disorder with anxiety features.^\nAn unique and intriguing characteristic of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and LSD-like substances is the recurrence of some of the symptoms which appear during the intoxication, in the absence of recent intake of hallucinogens. Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD) is a condition in which the re-experiencing of one or more perceptual symptoms causes significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning and may be extremely debilitating. Benzodiazepines are one of the recommended agents for the treatment of HPPD but it is unclear which of them may be more helpful. The goal of our investigation was to assess the efficacy of clonazepam in the treatment of LSD-induced HPPD. Sixteen patients fulfilled entrance criteria. All complained of HPPD with anxiety features for at least 3 months and were drug free at least 3 months. They received clonazepam 2 mg/day for 2 months. Follow-up was continued for 6 months.

6362,"Ketamine's antidepressant efficacy is extended for at least four weeks in subjects with a family history of an alcohol use disorder.^\nBACKGROUND: A single subanesthetic infusion of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine has rapid and potent antidepressant properties in treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (TRD). As a family history of an alcohol use disorder is a positive predictor of ketamine's antidepressant response and the strength of the association increases over time, we hypothesized that depressed subjects with a family history of an alcohol use disorder would have greater antidepressant durability and that riluzole would augment and/or extend ketamine's antidepressant efficacy. METHODS: Fifty-two TRD subjects received an open-label infusion of ketamine (0.5mg/kg over 40 minutes), and, four to six hours post-infusion, were randomized to either flexible-dose (100-200mg/day) riluzole or placebo in the following proportions: Family History Positive (FHP) riluzole (n = 10), FHP placebo (n = 9), Family History Negative (FHN) riluzole (n = 16), and FHN placebo (n = 17). RESULTS: FHP subjects randomized to placebo had a greater antidepressant response than FHN subjects; however, contrary to our initial hypothesis, there was no significant difference in antidepressant efficacy with riluzole. Although potentially underpowered, there was no difference in overall time-to-relapse based on randomization status (riluzole responders: n = 15, placebo responders: n = 17). Yet, time-to-relapse was longer in FHP placebo responders (n = 8) compared to FHN placebo responders (n = 9) with, again, no significant difference in time-to-relapse in FHP riluzole responders (n = 6) compared to FHN riluzole responders (n = 9).

180,"Predicting Reactions to Psychedelic Drugs: A Systematic Review of States and Traits Related to Acute Drug Effects.^\nPsychedelic drugs are increasingly being incorporated into therapeutic contexts for the purposes of promoting mental health. However, they can also induce adverse reactions in some individuals, and it is difficult to predict before treatment who is likely to experience positive or adverse acute effects. Although consideration of setting and dosage as well as excluding individuals with psychotic predispositions has thus far led to a high degree of safety, it is imperative that researchers develop a more nuanced understanding of how to predict individual reactions. To this end, the current systematic review coalesced the results of 14 studies that included baseline states or traits predictive of the acute effects of psychedelics. Individuals high in the traits of absorption, openness, and acceptance as well as a state of surrender were more likely to have positive and mystical-type experiences, whereas those low in openness and surrender or in preoccupied, apprehensive, or confused psychological states were more likely to experience acute adverse reactions. Participant sex was not a robust predictor of drug effects, but 5-HT2AR binding potential, executive network node diversity, and rACC volume may be potential baseline biomarkers related to acute reactions. Finally, increased age and experience with psychedelics were individual differences related to generally less intense effects, indicating that users may become slightly less sensitive to the effects of the drugs after repeated usage. Although future well-powered, placebo-controlled trials directly comparing the relative importance of these predictors is needed, this review synthesizes the field's current understanding of how to predict acute reactions to psychedelic drugs.",8,"[0.002088899491354823, 0.0006762894918210804, 0.0036480685230344534, 0.0014015643391758204, 0.00388804217800498, 0.002778797410428524, 0.0024282538797706366, 0.002903863787651062, 0.9739447832107544, 0.0030175759457051754, 0.0032238056883215904]",8

Org 25935 reduced the ketamine-induced increases in measures of psychosis (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)) and perceptual alterations (Clinician Administered Dissociative Symptoms Scale (CADSS)). The magnitude of the effect of Org 25935 on ketamine-induced increases in Total PANSS and CADSS Clinician-rated scores was 0.71 and 0.98 (SD units), respectively. None of the behavioral effects of ketamine were increased by Org 25935 pretreatment. Org 25935 worsened some aspects of learning and delayed recall, and trended to improve choice reaction time. This study demonstrates for the first time in humans that a GlyT1 inhibitor reduces the effects induced by NMDA receptor antagonism. These findings provide preliminary support for further study of the antipsychotic potential of GlyT1 inhibitors.",0,"[0.9909074306488037, 0.0007809062954038382, 0.0004995231865905225, 0.0016926764510571957, 0.0007176291546784341, 0.0008060715044848621, 0.0006479935254901648, 0.0017622893210500479, 0.0007235214579850435, 0.0008628179784864187, 0.0005992486258037388]",0
8746,"Antisuicidal Response Following Ketamine Infusion Is Associated With Decreased Nighttime Wakefulness in Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar Disorder.^\nOBJECTIVE: Insomnia and disrupted sleep are associated with increased risk of suicide. The N-methyl-d-aspartate antagonist ketamine has been associated with reduced suicidal thoughts, but the mechanism of action is unknown. This study sought to evaluate differences in nocturnal wakefulness in depressed individuals who did and did not have an antisuicidal response to ketamine. METHODS: Thirty-four participants with baseline suicidal ideation diagnosed with either DSM-IV major depressive disorder (n = 23) or bipolar depression (n = 11) between 2006 and 2013 completed nighttime electroencephalography (EEG) the night before and the night after a single ketamine infusion (0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes). Suicidal ideation was assessed at baseline and the morning after ketamine infusion via several measures, including the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale suicide item, the suicide item of the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and the first 5 items of the Scale for Suicide Ideation. A generalized linear mixed model evaluated differences in nocturnal wakefulness, as verified by EEG, between those who had an antisuicidal response to ketamine and those who did not, controlling for baseline nocturnal wakefulness. Results were also compared to the sleep of healthy controls (n = 22). RESULTS: After analyses adjusted for baseline sleep, participants with an antisuicidal response to ketamine showed significantly reduced nocturnal wakefulness the night after ketamine infusion compared to those without an antisuicidal response (F₁,₂₂ = 5.04, P = .04). Level of nocturnal wakefulness after antisuicidal response to ketamine did not differ significantly from nocturnal wakefulness in the control sample but did differ at a trend level (F₁,₄₀ = 3.15, P = .08). CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in wakefulness following ketamine may point to a biological mechanism underlying the effect of ketamine on suicidal ideation.

9525,"Influence of DNA methylation on the antidepressant effect of ketamine.^\nBackground: Ketamine is a high‐affinity non‐competitive NMDA (N‐methyl‐D‐aspartic, N‐methyl‐D‐aspartic) receptor antagonist. In recent years, studies have found that ketamine has rapid onset antidepressant effect. However, the use of ketamine for antidepressant treatment has the risk of causing adverse reactions such as psychiatric symptoms, addiction, and so on. The aim of this study is to find DNA methylation sites related to the efficacy of ketamine and screening‐related genes. It will be the foundation of the accurate use of ketamine for depression. Methods: This study included a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study of brain tumors with depression. The subjects received a small dose of ketamine intravenously (0.5mg/kg, 40 minutes) during the operation. The Montgomery‐ Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was used to assess depression. According to the improvement of depression on the third day after operation, patients were divided into an effective group (MADRS score reduction rate is greater than or equal to 50%) and an ineffective group (MADRS score reduction rate is less than 50%). Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC Bead Chip (850K DNA methylation chip) was used to carry out genomewide methylation of peripheral blood in two groups. The methylation sites with significant difference between the two groups (p < 0.05) were compared. According to the difference of methylation beta and the difference score, bioinformatics analysis was carried out using GO analysis and Pathway in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes to select chloramine. Ketone therapy is associated with different DNA methylation levels. Results: A total of 34 subjects using ketamine were included in this study, of who 20 were in the ineffective group and 14 were in the effective group. A total of 34,140 differentially methylated sites were identified by 850K DNA methylation chip screening. These differentially methylated sites were located on 13,209 genes. Through bioinformatics screening, we have identified 39 genes related to multiple pathways as the basis for subsequent research. Conclusion: It was found that many metabolic and signaling pathways were involved in the factors affecting the efficacy of ketamine. Through bioinformatics analysis and literature review, 39 anti‐ketamine drugs were screened out. Genes related to the efficacy of depression lay the foundation for future research.",3,"[0.001380764995701611, 0.0037215312477201223, 0.013817338272929192, 0.9288703799247742, 0.033481620252132416, 0.0007699676207266748, 0.005851111840456724, 0.0013720457209274173, 0.003936116583645344, 0.004161278251558542, 0.0026377858594059944]",3
6683,"Clinical experience using intranasal ketamine in the longitudinal treatment of juvenile bipolar disorder with fear of harm phenotype.^\nOBJECTIVES: Fear of Harm (FOH) is a pediatric onset phenotype of bipolar disorder (BD) characterized by BD plus treatment resistance, separation anxiety, aggressive obsessions, parasomnias, and thermal dysregulation. Intranasal ketamine (InK) in 12 youths with BD-FOH produced marked improvement during a two-week trial. Here we report on the open effectiveness and safety of InK in maintenance treatment of BD-FOH from the private practice of one author. METHODS: As part of a chart review, patients 18 years or older and parents of younger children responded to a clinical effectiveness and safety survey. Effectiveness was assessed from analysis of responses to 49 questions on symptomatology plus qualitative content analyses of written reports and chart review. Adverse events (AEs) were analyzed by frequency, duration and severity. Peak InK doses ranged from 20 to 360mg per administration. RESULTS: Surveys were completed on 45 patients treated with InK for 3 months to 6.5 years. Almost all patients were ""much"" to ""very much"" improved clinically and in ratings of social function and academic performance. Significant reductions were reported in all symptom categories. There were 13 reports of persistent AEs, none of which resulted in discontinuation. Acute emergence reactions were sporadically observed in up to 75%, but were mild and of brief duration. LIMITATIONS: Retrospective review from a single practice without placebo control with potential for response and recall bias. CONCLUSIONS: InK every 3-4 days at sub-anesthetic doses appeared to be a beneficial and well-tolerated treatment. Use of InK may be considered as a tertiary alternative in treatment refractory cases.

3002,"Influence of formulation and route of administration on ketamine's safety and tolerability: systematic review.^\nPURPOSE: Ketamine has rapid-onset antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. Common side effects include dissociation (a sense of detachment from reality) and increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The objective of this structured review was to examine the effect of ketamine formulation and route of administration on its pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability, to identify formulation characteristics and routes of administration that might minimise side effects. METHODS: This was a structured review of published ketamine pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability data for any ketamine formulation. The ratio of ketamine:norketamine was calculated from reported C(max) values, as a measure of first pass metabolism. The effect of formulation and route of administration on safety was evaluated by measuring mean changes in systolic blood pressure and tolerability by changes in dissociation ratings. Data were correlated using Spearman's method. RESULTS: A total of 41 treatment arms were identified from 21 publications, and included formulation development studies in healthy volunteers, and studies in clinical populations (patients undergoing anaesthesia, or being treated for pain or depression). Ketamine:norketamine ratios were strongly positively correlated with change in dissociation ratings (r = 0.89) and change in blood pressure (r = 0.96), and strongly negatively correlated with ketamine T(max) (r = - 0.87; p < 0.00001 for all). Ketamine T(max) strongly positively correlated with a change in dissociation ratings (r = - 0.96) and change in blood pressure (r = - 0.99; p < 0.00001 for all).

5997,"Comparison of the effect of low dose ketamine plus dexmedetomidine vs low dose ketamine plus midazolam on hemodynamic changes and pain in electroconvulsive therapy.^\nBackground: Currently, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is used as an effective treatment method in many psychiatric disorders. The basis of a successful electroshock session is to create a seizure with the precise intensity, quality and duration. In addition to the appropriate method of shock induction, appropriate anesthesia methods should be used to cause such seizures. The present study compared a combination of low-dose ketamine and dexmedetomidine (Ketodex) with a combination of low-dose ketamine and midazolam (Ketomid) on hemodynamic changes in electroshocks applied to patients referred from the psychiatric ward. Methodology: This study was a randomized triple-blind clinical trial performed after obtaining permission from the Medical Ethics Committee of the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. For this purpose, 70 patients were selected for electroshock therapy and randomly distributed into two groups of 35 people. In the first group, 0.04 mg/kg midazolam was combined with ketamine 0.1 mg/kg and in the second group, 0.5 μg/kg dexmedetomidine with 0.1 mg/kg ketamine. The patients were placed under complete cardiovascular monitoring. Hemodynamic changes of patients were measured and recorded before injection, after injection, after shock, and at 5 and 10 min after the end of seizures. Results: In this study, 70 patients who were candidates for receiving ECT were equally divided into two groups of 35: one group received a mixture of Ketodex and the second group a combination of Ketomid. The two study groups showed no significant difference in terms of systolic pressure (P = 0.883), diastolic (P = 0.443), mean arterial pressure (P = 0.443), oxygen saturation (P = 0.018), and heart rate (P = 0.286). Complications such as headache, muscular pain (P = 0.01), bradycardia, nausea and vomiting were reported in the dexmedetomidine and ketamine groups. Conclusion: Our study showed that although systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen saturation were significantly reduced in both study groups, no significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of hemodynamic changes and neither drug group in our study population was different from the other in terms of these parameters. In addition, neither option was superior to the other.

Within the next few years MDMA-assisted therapy is projected for approval by regulatory authorities. MDMA's primary mechanism of action includes modulation of monoamine signaling by increasing release and inhibiting reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and, to a lesser extent, dopamine. This pharmacology affects sympathomimetic physiology. In controlled trials, special attention has been given to cardiovascular adverse events (AEs), because transient increases in heart rate and blood pressure have been observed during the MDMA-assisted therapy sessions. Finding and quantifying the potential drivers of cardiac AEs in clinical trials is difficult since only a relatively small number of participants have been included in these studies, and a limited set of allowed concomitant drugs has been studied. In this study a more diverse set of reports from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System was surveyed. We found 17 cases of cardiovascular AEs, in which the individuals had taken one or more substances in addition to MDMA.

This case series examines serial ketamine infusions in reducing SI and depression scores in adults with MDD admitted to a tertiary care hospital. METHODS: Five inpatients with MDD and SI admitted to hospital in Toronto, Canada received six infusions of 0.5 mg/kg intravenous (IV) ketamine (n = 5) over approximately 12 days, in addition to treatment-as-usual. Suicide and depression rating scores (Scale for Suicidal Ideation, SSI; Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale, MADRS) were obtained at baseline, on treatment days, on days 14 and 42 (primary endpoint). RESULTS: All patients experienced benefit with ketamine. SSI scores diminished by 84% from 14.0 ± 4.5 at baseline to 2.2 ± 2.5 at study endpoint. MADRS scores diminished by 47% from 42.2 ± 5.3 at baseline to 22.4 ± 8.0. Two patients withdrew from the study, one to initiate electroconvulsive therapy and one due to an adverse event (dissociative effects) during the ketamine infusion. LIMITATIONS: The major limitation of this study is the small sample size. DISCUSSION: These preliminary pilot data are promising with a greater than two-fold reduction in SI following ketamine infusions.

Of 279 studies identified, 25 were included. Acute effects included excitation of frontolateral/frontomedial cortex, medial temporal lobe, and occipital cortex, and inhibition of the default mode network. Long-term use was associated with thinning of the posterior cingulate cortex, thickening of the anterior cingulate cortex, and decreased neocortical 5-HT2A receptor binding.

6158,"Comparative Acute Effects of LSD, Psilocybin and Mescaline.^\nLSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), psilocybin (the active substance in ""magic mushrooms"") and mescaline (the active substance in Peyote and San Pedro cacti) are serotonergic hallucinogens widely used for recreational and/or ethnomedical purposes. LSD, psilocybin and mescaline are thought to induce prototypical psychedelic effects primarily via stimulation of the 5‐HT2A receptor. However, there are differences in their molecular structures (LSD: ergoline, psilocybin: tryptamine; mescaline: phenethylamine)and receptor activation profiles which may induce different subjective effects. To date, there are no modern studies comparing these three substances directly within the same clinical study and research subjects using validated psychometric tools. Therefore, the LPM‐Study compares the acute effects of LSD, psilocybin, mescaline and placebo in a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, 4‐period cross‐over design with four treatment conditions: 1) 100 μg LSD, 2) 20 mg psilocybin, 3) 300 mg mescaline, and 4) placebo. The main objective of this study is to determine whether LSD, psilocybin and mescaline produce qualitatively similar subjective alterations of mind and associated brain activity patterns despite their unique receptor activation profiles. The study investigates psychological (psychometry), physiological and neuronal (magnetic resonance imaging) variables.

Groups were: drug-naive controls (n = 24); recent ecstasy/MDMA users, who had taken ecstasy/MDMA 2-3 days before the first testing session (n = 25), and abstinent users, who had not taken ecstasy/MDMA for at least 8 days before testing (n = 17). Procedural memory did not differ between groups, but greater lifetime consumption of ecstasy was associated with poorer procedural memory. Recent ecstasy/MDMA users who had taken other drugs (mainly cannabis) 48-24 h before testing exhibited poorer declarative memory than controls, but recent users who had not taken other drugs in this 48-24-h period did not differ from controls. Greater lifetime consumption of ecstasy, and of cocaine, were associated with greater deficits in declarative memory.

3181,"Acute ketamine challenge increases resting state prefrontal-hippocampal connectivity in both humans and rats.^\nRATIONALE: Aberrant prefrontal-hippocampal (PFC-HC) connectivity is disrupted in several psychiatric and at-risk conditions. Advances in rodent functional imaging have opened the possibility that this phenotype could serve as a translational imaging marker for psychiatric research. Recent evidence from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies has indicated an increase in PFC-HC coupling during working-memory tasks in both schizophrenic patients and at-risk populations, in contrast to a decrease in resting-state PFC-HC connectivity. Acute ketamine challenge is widely used in both humans and rats as a pharmacological model to study the mechanisms of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor hypofunction in the context of psychiatric disorders. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to establish whether acute ketamine challenge has consistent effects in rats and humans by investigating resting-state fMRI PFC-HC connectivity and thus to corroborate its potential utility as a translational probe. METHODS: Twenty-four healthy human subjects (12 females, mean age 25 years) received intravenous doses of either saline (placebo) or ketamine (0.5 mg/kg body weight). Eighteen Sprague-Dawley male rats received either saline or ketamine (25 mg/kg). Resting-state fMRI measurements took place after injections, and the data were analyzed for PFC-HC functional connectivity. RESULTS: In both species, ketamine induced a robust increase in PFC-HC coupling, in contrast to findings in chronic schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: This translational comparison demonstrates a cross-species consistency in pharmacological effect and elucidates ketamine-induced alterations in PFC-HC coupling, a phenotype often disrupted in pathological conditions, which may give clue to understanding of psychiatric disorders and their onset, and help in the development of new treatments.",4,"[0.004273454193025827, 0.005853540729731321, 0.009624024853110313, 0.16019032895565033, 0.7905409336090088, 0.002383101498708129, 0.007474871352314949, 0.00362020218744874, 0.006119041703641415, 0.0068709650076925755, 0.003049487015232444]",3

In some instances less, in a few more, was given. Included in the study were also a few psychotic patients, and one female patient who was to undergo lobotomy because of a psychotic illness. The volunteers, after having received LSD, were at first clinically observed, individually, in a hospital room with daylight, which excluded partial sensory restriction in a darkened room. Later, Dr. Hyde and his associates used sociological techniques to study the behavior of LSD volunteers in a group or among psychotic hospital patients (10, 23). Neurological signs were recorded whenever they occurred; the autonomic nervous system was systematically examined by pharmacological techniques and the use of the polygraph; verbalizations were often recorded by tape or wire recording machines. In general, the LSD-induced mental manifestations seemed to be similar to those observed in the acute schizophrenic turmoil state. Specifically outstanding were dissociation of thought processes, inappropriate affect and catatonic features. Disturbances in the functions of the autonomic nervous system were present in all LSD subjects.

7083,"Exploring the effect of microdosing psychedelics on creativity in an open-label natural setting.^\nINTRODUCTION: Taking microdoses (a mere fraction of normal doses) of psychedelic substances, such as truffles, recently gained popularity, as it allegedly has multiple beneficial effects including creativity and problem-solving performance, potentially through targeting serotonergic 5-HT(2A) receptors and promoting cognitive flexibility, crucial to creative thinking. Nevertheless, enhancing effects of microdosing remain anecdotal, and in the absence of quantitative research on microdosing psychedelics, it is impossible to draw definitive conclusions on that matter. Here, our main aim was to quantitatively explore the cognitive-enhancing potential of microdosing psychedelics in healthy adults. METHODS: During a microdosing event organized by the Dutch Psychedelic Society, we examined the effects of psychedelic truffles (which were later analyzed to quantify active psychedelic alkaloids) on two creativity-related problem-solving tasks: the Picture Concept Task assessing convergent thinking and the Alternative Uses Task assessing divergent thinking. A short version of the Ravens Progressive Matrices task assessed potential changes in fluid intelligence. We tested once before taking a microdose and once while the effects were expected to be manifested. RESULTS: We found that both convergent and divergent thinking performance was improved after a non-blinded microdose, whereas fluid intelligence was unaffected. CONCLUSION: While this study provides quantitative support for the cognitive-enhancing properties of microdosing psychedelics, future research has to confirm these preliminary findings in more rigorous placebo-controlled study designs. Based on these preliminary results, we speculate that psychedelics might affect cognitive metacontrol policies by optimizing the balance between cognitive persistence and flexibility. We hope this study will motivate future microdosing studies with more controlled designs to test this hypothesis.",9,"[0.001065121847204864, 0.002461665775626898, 0.0007741466397419572, 0.0032785902731120586, 0.001355148502625525, 0.0014856152702122927, 0.0008841739618219435, 0.0016287446487694979, 0.0007798913866281509, 0.9854267835617065, 0.0008601743611507118]",9
8554,"DMT Models the Near-Death Experience.^\nNear-death experiences (NDEs) are complex subjective experiences, which have been previously associated with the psychedelic experience and more specifically with the experience induced by the potent serotonergic, N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT). Potential similarities between both subjective states have been noted previously, including the subjective feeling of transcending one's body and entering an alternative realm, perceiving and communicating with sentient 'entities' and themes related to death and dying. In this within-subjects placebo-controled study we aimed to test the similarities between the DMT state and NDEs, by administering DMT and placebo to 13 healthy participants, who then completed a validated and widely used measure of NDEs. Results revealed significant increases in phenomenological features associated with the NDE, following DMT administration compared to placebo. Also, we found significant relationships between the NDE scores and DMT-induced ego-dissolution and mystical-type experiences, as well as a significant association between NDE scores and baseline trait 'absorption' and delusional ideation measured at baseline. Furthermore, we found a significant overlap in nearly all of the NDE phenomenological features when comparing DMT-induced NDEs with a matched group of 'actual' NDE experiencers.

In addition, a substantial proportion of the MDMA users has claimed to drive a car when under the influence of MDMA and/or other drugs. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of MDMA and alcohol, combined and alone, on actual driving performance and laboratory tasks related to driving. METHODS: Eighteen healthy subjects participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, six-way cross-over study. Treatments consisted of MDMA 0, 75, and 100 mg with and without alcohol, aiming at 0.06 mg/ml BAC. Laboratory tests (critical tracking task, object movement estimation task) were conducted between 1.5 and 2 h postdrug (0.5 and 1 h postalcohol). Actual driving tests (road tracking test, car-following test) were conducted between 3 and 5 h postdrug (2 and 4 h postalcohol). Subjects completed the addiction research center inventory (ARCI) and rated their driving quality and mental effort during driving. RESULTS: Alcohol alone impaired critical tracking performance, as well as a number of actual driving performance parameters [i.e., standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP), brake reaction time, and coherence]. MDMA alone reduced SDLP and standard deviation of speed. MDMA significantly moderated alcohol induced impairment of road tracking performance but did not affect alcohol impairments of car-following and laboratory task performance. Subjective data seemed to support objective data. CONCLUSION: MDMA moderated the impairing effects of a low dose of alcohol on road tracking performance but it could not overcome alcohol-induced impairment on other aspects of driving behavior or driving related performance.",0,"[0.9907979965209961, 0.0007768644718453288, 0.0005320382188074291, 0.0019189321901649237, 0.0007303738384507596, 0.0008658730075694621, 0.0006796438246965408, 0.0015471292426809669, 0.0007655741646885872, 0.0008056985680013895, 0.0005798875354230404]",0

We studied 44 LSD-induced HPPD subjects and 88 matched controls to search for spectral and evoked potential differences using quantitative EEG (qEEG). HPPD subjects demonstrated faster alpha frequency and shorter VER (visual evoked response) latency, consistent with prior animal and human data on response to acute LSD administration which suggest LSD-induced cortical disinhibition. AER (auditory evoked response) latency was prolonged consistent with a differential LSD effect upon visual and auditory systems. The exploratory T-statistic significance probability mapping (T-SPM) technique demonstrated HPPD-control differences mostly involving temporal and left parietal scalp regions, confirmed by a split-half analysis. Significant variables were all derived from the long latency flash VER and click AER. None were derived from spectral analyzed EEG data.

6470,"Distinct trajectories of antidepressant response to intravenous ketamine.^\nBACKGROUND: The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine is potentially effective in treatment resistant depression. However, its antidepressant efficacy is highly variable, and there is little information about predictors of response. METHODS: We employed growth mixture modeling (GMM) analysis to examine specific response trajectories to intravenous (IV) ketamine (three infusions; mean dose 0.63 mg/kg, SD 0.28, range 0.30 - 2.98 mg/kg over 40 min) in 328 depressed adult outpatients referred to a community clinic. The Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS-SR) assessed depression severity at baseline and before each infusion, up to three infusions for four total observations. RESULTS: GMM revealed three QIDS-SR response trajectories. There were two groups of severely depressed patients, with contrasting responses to ketamine. One group (n=135, baseline QIDS-SR=18.8) had a robust antidepressant response (final QIDS-SR=7.3); the other group (n=97, QIDS-SR=19.8) was less responsive (final QIDS-SR=15.6). A third group (n=96) was less severely depressed at baseline (QIDS-SR=11.7), with intermediate antidepressant response (final QIDS-SR=6.6). Comparisons of demographic and clinical characteristics between groups with severe baseline depression revealed higher childhood physical abuse in the group with robust ketamine response (p=0.01). LIMITATIONS: This was a retrospective analysis on a naturalistic sample. Patients were unblinded and more heterogenous than those included in most controlled clinical trial samples. Information pertaining to traumatic events occurring after childhood and pre-existing or concurrent medical conditions that may have affected outcomes was not available.

6072,"Antidepressant Effects of Ayahuasca: a Randomized Placebo Controlled Trial in Treatment Resistant Depression.^\n1) Background The therapeutic effectiveness of currently available antidepressant is low. Less than 50% of the patients achieve remission after single treatment, and about 30% after four different treatments. Besides low response rates, pharmacological treatment are associated with several side effects and response onset is usually long ( 2‐3 weeks). Thus, great effort has been made to the development of alternative antidepressants. For instance, ketamine, a N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, has rapid and potent antidepressant effects in treatment of major depressive and bipolar disorders. This proposal aims at testing the antidepressant effects of Ayahuasca, traditionally prepared by decoction of two plants: Psychotria viridis and Banisteriopsis caapi, long used by Amazonian Amerindians. P. viridis is a rich source of the serotonergic agonist N,N‐dimethyltryptamine (DMT), whereas B. caapi contains potent monoamine oxidase‐A inhibitors (MAOi‐A) such as harmine, harmaline, and tetrahydroharmine, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Common effects of Ayahuasca include sedation, gastrointestinal distress, changes of spatiotemporal scaling, dissociation, sense of well‐being, insights, feelings of apprehension, increased interoceptive attention and sensory pseudo‐hallucinations. Effects begin at 30‐40 min after oral intake, and last up to 4 hours. Previous studies suggest the absence of psychological, neuropsychological or psychiatric harm caused by prolonged Ayahuasca consumption, and it is not addictive, on the contrary, it also shows promise in treating addiction. Recently, two preliminary open label studies have tested tolerability, safety and the antidepressant effect of Ayahuasca in treatment‐resistant depression. In the first study, six patients were recruited, in the second, 17 patients. The results show significant decrease in depression severity (HAM‐D & MADRS scales) already at 2 hours after intake, which lasted for 21 days. Although the results are promising, they must be considered with caution, specially due to the lack of control of the placebo effect, which is generally high in clinical trials. Thus, the present study is a randomized placebo‐controlled trial in 50 patients with treatment resistant depression. Besides the Antidepressant effects of Ayahuasca, this study will also evaluate different biomarkers of depression, including anatomical and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), serum levels of BDNF, TNF‐a, cortisol, IL‐6, and IL‐10, polysomnography, neuropsychological and psychiatric scales and questionnaires. 2. Methods All 50 patients will undergo routine evaluation, including complete blood testing for individual glycemic profile, serum cholesterol and triglyceride, plasma sodium and potassium, urea and creatinine. Patients will undergo a wash‐out period, between 7 and 14 days prior to the experimental session, depending on the lifetime of the antidepressant in use. Experiments will take place at the Hospital Universitário Onofre Lopes, a tertiary university hospital affiliated to the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN), Brazil. In the treatment session, 25 patients will drink Ayahuasca, 25 will drink an inert placebo. Psychiatric scales (HAM‐D, MADRS, BPRS, CADSS and YMRS) will be completed during treatment session, day one before (‐D1), one day after (+D1), two days (+D2), seven days (+D7), fourteen days (+D14), one month (+M1), and up to six months (+M6) following the treatment session. The following exams will also be conducted at D‐1 and D+1: neuropsychological tests (watch test, trail test, and N‐back), structural and functional MRI, polysomnography and blood testing (BDNF, TNF‐a, cortisol, oxytocin, IL‐6, and IL‐10).",4,"[0.001839904231019318, 0.0018839073600247502, 0.003550142515450716, 0.009428766556084156, 0.966231107711792, 0.0018369053723290563, 0.004964393097907305, 0.00323127512820065, 0.0038620021659880877, 0.0020639197900891304, 0.001107600750401616]",4
5928,"Evidence that subanesthetic doses of ketamine cause sustained disruptions of NMDA and AMPA-mediated frontoparietal connectivity in humans.^\nFollowing the discovery of the antidepressant properties of ketamine, there has been a recent resurgence in the interest in this NMDA receptor antagonist. Although detailed animal models of the molecular mechanisms underlying ketamine’s effects have emerged, there are few MEG/EEG studies examining the acute subanesthetic effects of ketamine infusion in man. We recorded 275 channel MEG in two experiments (n = 25 human males) examining the effects of subanesthetic ketamine infusion. MEG power spectra revealed a rich set of significant oscillatory changes compared with placebo sessions, including decreases in occipital, parietal, and anterior cingulate alpha power, increases in medial frontal theta power, and increases in parietal and cingulate cortex high gamma power. Each of these spectral effects demonstrated their own set of temporal dynamics. Dynamic causal modeling of frontoparietal connectivity changes with ketamine indicated a decrease in NMDA and AMPA-mediated frontal-to-parietal connectivity. AMPA-mediated connectivity changes were sustained for up to 50 min after ketamine infusion had ceased, by which time perceptual distortions were absent. The results also indicated a decrease in gain of parietal pyramidal cells, which was correlated with participants’ self-reports of blissful state. Based on these results, we suggest that the antidepressant effects of ketamine may depend on its ability to change the balance of frontoparietal connectivity patterns.

4684,"Long-term outcome of patients who receive ketamine during research.^\nBACKGROUND: To comprehend the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and to facilitate drug discovery, animal and human models of schizophrenia are necessary. Ketamine, a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, has been used to probe glutamatergic function in normal and schizophrenic volunteers. These studies and others have provided data consistent with a putative involvement of a glutamatergic dysfunction in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia; however, these studies have also raised concerns about the distress inflicted on patients, the potential for adverse events, and the serious long-term effects that could possibly be induced by symptom-simulating action. METHODS: For all patient volunteers (n = 30) who participated in these studies, we reviewed the acute safety during and in the immediate postketamine administration. Patients available for long-term follow-up (n = 25) were matched to a group of patients (n = 25) who participated in research but did not receive ketamine. We compared their long-term outcome in terms of psychopathology, the need for psychiatric care, and the amount of antipsychotic medication required for optimal therapeutic response. RESULTS: There were no serious adverse events in more than 90 ketamine interviews. Distress to patients was minimal, which is shown by the lack of anxiety ratings. Over a mean follow-up period of 8 months, we found no differences between patients who did and did not receive ketamine on any measures of psychopathology, psychiatric care, or the amount of antipsychotic medication.

METHODS: Data were pooled from five clinical ketamine trials. Treatment-resistant inpatients (n = 128) with DSM-IV-TR-diagnosed major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar depression received one subanesthetic (0.5 mg/kg) ketamine infusion over 40 min. Composite SI variable scores were analyzed using growth mixture modeling to generate SI response classes, and class membership predictors were evaluated using multinomial logistic regressions. Putative predictors included demographic variables and various peripheral plasma markers. RESULTS: The best-fitting growth mixture model comprised three classes: Non-Responders (29%), Responders (44%), and Remitters (27%). For Responders and Remitters, maximal improvements were achieved by Day 1. Improvements in SI occurred independently of improvements in a composite Depressed Mood variable for Responders, and partially independently for Remitters. Indicators of chronic SI and self-injury were associated with belonging to the Non-Responder group. Higher levels of baseline plasma interleukin-5 (IL-5) were linked to Remitters rather than Responders. LIMITATIONS: Subjects were not selected for active suicidal thoughts; findings only extend to Day 3; and plasma, rather than CSF, markers were used. CONCLUSION: The results underscore the heterogeneity of SI response to ketamine and its potential independence from changes in Depressed Mood. Individuals reporting symptoms suggesting a longstanding history of chronic SI were less likely to respond or remit post-ketamine.",1,"[0.0031763019505888224, 0.9673991203308105, 0.0026130161713808775, 0.0034849157091230154, 0.0015353449853137136, 0.0024124658666551113, 0.001923050731420517, 0.006240785121917725, 0.0012886665062978864, 0.004627927206456661, 0.00529846316203475]",1
4404,"The Effects of Ecstasy (MDMA) on Brain Serotonin Transporters Are Dependent on Age-of-First Exposure in Recreational Users and Animals.^\nRationale and Objective: Little is known on the effects of ecstasy (MDMA, a potent 5-HT-releaser and neurotoxin) exposure on brain development in teenagers. The objective of this study was to investigate whether in humans, like previous observations made in animals, the effects of MDMA on the 5-HT system are dependent on age-of-first exposure. Methods: 5-HT transporter (SERT) densities in the frontal cortex and midbrain were assessed with [123I]β-CIT single photon emission computed tomography in 33 users of ecstasy. Subjects were stratified for early-exposed users (age-at-first exposure 14-18 years; developing brain), and late-exposed users (age-at-first exposure 18-36 years; mature brain). In parallel, we investigated the effects of age experimentally with MDMA in early-exposed (adolescent) rats and late-exposed (adult) rats using the same radioligand. Results: On average, five years after first exposure, we found a strong inverse relationship, wherein age-at-first exposure predicted 79% of the midbrain SERT variability in early (developing brain) exposed ecstasy users, whereas this was only 0.3% in late (mature brain) exposed users (p = 0.007). No such effect was observed in the frontal cortex. In rats, a significant age-BY-treatment effect (p<0.01) was observed as well, however only in the frontal cortex. Conclusions: These age-related effects most likely reflect differences in the maturational stage of the 5-HT projection fields at age-at-first exposure and enhanced outgrowth of the 5-HT system due to 5-HT's neurotrophic effects. Ultimately, our findings stress the need for more knowledge on the effects of pharmacotherapies that alter brain 5-HT levels in the pediatric population. © 2012 Klomp et al.",3,"[0.0018156004371121526, 0.005583199672400951, 0.009813404642045498, 0.7831741571426392, 0.16583476960659027, 0.0014849727740511298, 0.00944106001406908, 0.0026159186381846666, 0.004210900980979204, 0.012886395677924156, 0.0031396904960274696]",3
6629,"Trends in drug use among electronic dance music party attendees in New York City, 2016-2019.^\nOBJECTIVE: Electronic dance music (EDM) party attendees are a high-risk population for drug use and associated adverse effects. We examined trends in past-year drug use within this population to better inform prevention and harm reduction efforts. METHODS: Each summer from 2016 through 2019, we used time-space sampling to survey a cross-section of adults entering EDM parties at randomly selected nightclubs and at dance festivals in New York City. Ns ranged from 504 (2019) to 1,087 (2016). We estimated log-linear trends in past-year use of 16 different synthetic drugs or drug classes. RESULTS: Between 2016 and 2019, estimated past-year prevalence of use of ketamine increased from 5.9% to 15.3% (a 157.6% relative increase; P = .007), LSD use increased from 9.9% to 16.6% (a 67.7% relative increase, P < .001), powder cocaine use increased from 17.3% to 35.2% (a 103.5% relative increase, P < .001), and GHB use increased from 1.0% to 4.2% (a 311.8% relative increase; P = .002). Past-year use of >3 drugs increased from 12.7% to 20.5% (a 61.4% relative increase; P = .013); however, estimated past-year use of unknown powders decreased from 2.0% to 1.1% (a relative 44.7% decrease; P = .038) and ecstasy/MDMA/Molly use was stable across years (at 25.0 to 28.5 %; P = .687). CONCLUSIONS: Reports of powder cocaine, LSD, ketamine, and GHB are becoming more prevalent among EDM party attendees. Prevention and harm reduction efforts are needed to address increasing use. Research is also needed to examine whether increasing media coverage of medical use of ketamine and other psychedelics affects prevalence of recreational use.",10,"[0.002665151609107852, 0.008780715987086296, 0.010378541424870491, 0.004218193702399731, 0.001942700007930398, 0.023569593206048012, 0.0018727779388427734, 0.002079050289466977, 0.004382198676466942, 0.004469109233468771, 0.9356419444084167]",10
5705,"D-serine plasma concentration is a potential biomarker of (R,S)-ketamine antidepressant response in subjects with treatment-resistant depression.^\nRATIONALE: (R,S)-ketamine is a rapid and effective antidepressant drug that produces a response in two thirds of patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The underlying biochemical differences between a (R,S)-ketamine responder (KET-R) and non-responder (KET-NR) have not been definitively identified but may involve serine metabolism. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between baseline plasma concentrations of D-serine and its precursor L-serine and antidepressant response to (R,S)-ketamine in TRD patients. METHODS: Plasma samples were obtained from 21 TRD patients at baseline, 60 min before initiation of the (R,S)-ketamine infusion. Patients were classified as KET-Rs (n = 8) or KET-NRs (n = 13) based upon the difference in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores at baseline and 230 min after infusion, with response defined as a ≥50 % decrease in MADRS score. The plasma concentrations of D-serine and L-serine were determined using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Baseline D-serine plasma concentrations were significantly lower in KET-Rs (3.02 ± 0.21 μM) than in KET-NRs (4.68 ± 0.81 μM), p < 0.001. A significant relationship between baseline D-serine plasma concentrations and percent change in MADRS at 230 min was determined using a Pearson correlation, r = 0.77, p < 0.001, with baseline D-serine explaining 60 % of the variance in (R,S)-ketamine response. The baseline concentrations of L-serine (L-Ser) in KET-Rs were also significantly lower than those measured in KET-NRs (66.2 ± 9.6 μM vs 242.9 ± 5.6 μM, respectively; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that the baseline D-serine plasma concentrations were significantly lower in KET-Rs than in KET-NRs and suggest that this variable can be used to predict an antidepressant response following (R,S)-ketamine administration.",3,"[0.0014299395261332393, 0.0014789109118282795, 0.0021619535982608795, 0.9810694456100464, 0.0064752958714962006, 0.00036976259434595704, 0.0020095345098525286, 0.0005069295293651521, 0.0012783963466063142, 0.0017838756320998073, 0.001435968792065978]",3
4729,"A randomized controlled trial of intranasal ketamine in major depressive disorder.^\nBACKGROUND: The N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor antagonist ketamine, delivered via an intravenous route, has shown rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The current study was designed to test the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of intranasal ketamine in patients with depression who had failed at least one prior antidepressant trial. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study, 20 patients with major depression were randomly assigned, and 18 completed 2 treatment days with intranasal ketamine hydrochloride (50 mg) or saline solution. The primary efficacy outcome measure was change in depression severity 24 hours after ketamine or placebo, measured using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale. Secondary outcomes included persistence of benefit, changes in self-reports of depression, changes in anxiety, and proportion of responders. Potential psychotomimetic, dissociative, hemodynamic, and general adverse effects associated with ketamine were also measured. RESULTS: Patients showed significant improvement in depressive symptoms at 24 hours after ketamine compared to placebo (t = 4.39, p < .001; estimated mean Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale score difference of 7.6 ± 3.7; 95% confidence interval, 3.9-11.3). Response criteria were met by 8 of 18 patients (44%) 24 hours after ketamine administration compared with 1 of 18 (6%) after placebo (p = .033). Intranasal ketamine was well tolerated with minimal psychotomimetic or dissociative effects and was not associated with clinically significant changes in hemodynamic parameters. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first controlled evidence for the rapid antidepressant effects of intranasal ketamine. Treatment was associated with minimal adverse effects.

2800,"Visits to the emergency department due to ecstasy (MDMA) and amphetamine derivative consumption: Epidemiological, clinical and evolutional profile.^\nObjectives: To describe clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of emergency department visits related with ecstasy usage, determine the rate of re-visits of the patients and their related factors. Material and methods: The clinical histories of the patients coming to the Emergency Department for ecstasy-related problems were reviewed during 89 consecutive months in order to define the epidemiological and clinical profile. The computerized system of admission was used to study re-visits to the emergency department, reviewing the clinical history of the re-visits to see if they were related with drug consumption. Results: The study included 498 cases (71% male, mean age 26.5 years). The majority of the patients were attended on the weekend (66.6%) and at night (57%). Main complaints were anxiety or altered thoughts (32.8%), agitation (17.2%), impaired awareness level (7.2%) and convulsions or abnormal movements (5.6%). A total of 81% of the patients had consumed other substances besides ecstasy, mainly ethanol (53%), cocaine (36%) and gammahydroxibutirate (liquid ecstasy, 25%). Twenty six patients (5%) required admission to hospital (6 in the intensive care unit) and 4 died (0.8%). Fifteen percent of the patients were re-attended in the same ED for drug-related problems after a mean follow-up of 3 years, the new visit being more frequent during the first months. The need for an urgent psychiatric visit (OR: 6.3; 95% CI: 2.912.8) and hospital admission (OR: 3.5; 95% CI: 1.58.4) during their first ED attendance were independently associated with a greater risk of re-attendance. Conclusions: Ecstasy consumption frequently leads to an ED visit, sometimes due to severe medical complications, and at least 15% of patients will need urgent care again for drug-related problems within the next 3 years. This likelihood increases along with increased severity of the index episode (need of psychiatric consultation or hospital admission). © 2009 ElsevierEspaña, S.L.Todoslosderechosreservados.",5,"[0.0063002039678394794, 0.004941355437040329, 0.10278516262769699, 0.0024132304824888706, 0.02249232865869999, 0.7810676693916321, 0.031150460243225098, 0.011093700304627419, 0.010821993462741375, 0.010392640717327595, 0.016541289165616035]",2
6345,"The effects of MDMA-assisted therapy on alcohol and substance use in a phase 3 trial for treatment of severe PTSD.^\nBACKGROUND: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is commonly associated with alcohol and substance use disorders (ASUD). A randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial demonstrated the safety and efficacy of MDMA-assisted therapy (MDMA-AT) for the treatment of severe PTSD. This analysis explores patterns of alcohol and substance use in patients receiving MDMA-AT compared to placebo plus therapy (Placebo+Therapy). METHODS: Adult participants with severe PTSD (n = 90) were randomized to three blinded trauma-focused therapy sessions with either MDMA-AT or Placebo+Therapy. Eligible participants met DSM-5 criteria for severe PTSD and could meet criteria for mild (current) or moderate (early remission) alcohol or cannabis use disorder; other SUDs were excluded. The current analyses examined outcomes on standardized measures of hazardous alcohol (i.e., Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test; AUDIT) and drug (i.e., Drug Use Disorder Identification Test; DUDIT) use at baseline prior to randomization and at study termination. RESULTS: There were no treatment group differences in AUDIT or DUDIT scores at baseline. Compared to Placebo+therapy, MDMA-AT was associated with a significantly greater reduction in mean (SD) AUDIT change scores (Δ = -1.02 (3.52) as compared to placebo (Δ = 0.40 (2.70), F (80, 1) = 4.20, p = 0.0436; Hedge's g= .45). Changes in DUDIT scores were not significantly different between treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: MDMA-AT for severe PTSD may also lead to subclinical improvements in alcohol use.

Given the recent evidence that psychedelics induce neuroplasticity, this explorative study aimed at investigating the potential of psychedelics to sub-acutely change cognition. For this, we applied a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study with 24 healthy volunteers receiving 50 μg lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) or an inactive placebo. Sub-acute changes in cognition were measured 24 h after dosing, including memory (Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure, ROCF; 2D Object-Location Memory Task, OLMT; Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test, RAVLT), verbal fluency (phonological; semantic; switch), design fluency (basic; filter; switch), cognitive flexibility (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, WCST), sustained and switching attention (Trail Making Test, TMT), inhibitory control (Stroop Task) and perceptual reasoning (Block Design Test, BDT). The results show that when compared to placebo and corrected for Body Mass Index (BMI) and abstinence period from psychedelics, LSD sub-acutely improved visuospatial memory (ROCF immediate recall points and percentage, OLMT consolidation percentage) and phonological verbal fluency and impaired cognitive flexibility (WCST: fewer categories achieved; more perseveration, errors and conceptual level responses).

In light of recent evidence suggesting a significant impact of the glutamatergic system on key symptoms of schizophrenia, we assessed whether modulation of the glutamatergic system via blockage of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor might lead to changes of thalamic functional connectivity. METHODS: Based on the ketamine model of psychosis, we investigated changes in cortico-thalamic functional connectivity by intravenous ketamine challenge during a 55-minute resting-state scan. Thirty healthy volunteers were measured with pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design. RESULTS: Functional connectivity analysis revealed significant ketamine-specific changes within the thalamus hub network, more precisely, an increase of cortico-thalamic connectivity of the somatosensory and temporal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that changes of thalamic functioning as described for schizophrenia can be partly mimicked by NMDA-receptor blockage.

6016,"Interaction Between Reboxetine and 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine: pharmacodynamics (PD) and Pharmacokinetics (PK).^\nThe study will use a randomized double‐blind cross‐over design with four experimental sessions. Reboxetine (8 mg) or placebo will be administered the night before the experimental session and 1 h before the administration of MDMA (125 mg) or placebo to 16 healthy volunteers. Subjective and cardiovascular responses and plasma samples for pharmacokinetics will be repeatedly assessed throughout the experiments. We hypothesize that the highly selective norepinephrine uptake inhibitor reboxetine will attenuate subjective and especially heart rate and blood pressure responses to MDMA.

7048,"Altered Prediction-Error Processing May Underlie Psilocybin-Induced Changes in Self-Processing.^\nBackground: Psychedelic substances induce subjective alterations in our sense of body and sense of self. Despite the importance of altered bodily self‐perception in disorders such as anorexia nervosa or depression, the neural mechanisms underlying these changes are poorly understood. Methods: Fifteen healthy humans participated in a randomized, placebo‐controlled, within‐subject study. Participants received Placebo or Psilocybin (0.2 mg/kg body weight). A Roving Somatosensory Oddball Task was conducted while participants underwent simultaneous EEG/fMRI scanning. FMRI images were analyzed using a general linear model. Global field power and event‐related potentials were analyzed. Results: Psilocybin reduced the BOLD signal in the Deviant > Standard contrast in the prefrontal cortex (p<0.05, FWE corrected). A significant interaction between treatment condition and stimulus type was revealed for the frontal electrode AF2 (F(1, 14) = 5.129, p < 0.05) with a significant difference between Standard and Deviant in the Placebo condition, but not in the Psilocybin condition. A significant positive correlation was found between Psilocybin‐induced “Disembodiment” and the mean amplitude of the EEG difference wave in the Psilocybin condition (r = 0.630, p = 0.012). Conclusions: These results show that a disruption of tactile prediction error processing in the medial prefrontal cortex may underlie changes in bodily self‐perception. This seems to be driven by increased salience attribution to non‐salient stimuli under psilocybin. Together these results shed light on the mechanistic underpinnings of altered bodily self‐perception and may therefore highlight important therapeutic targets for psychiatric disorders characterized by altered bodily self‐perception body perception such as anorexia nervosa and depression.

9565,"Comparative effectiveness of repeated ketamine infusions in treating anhedonia in bipolar and unipolar depression.^\nObjectives: Anhedonia is a common, persistent, and disabling phenomenon in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar depression (BD). This study was conducted to investigate the comparative effectiveness of repeated ketamine infusions in treating anhedonia in Chinese individuals suffering from MDD and BD. Methods: Ninety-seven individuals suffering from MDD (n = 77) or BD (n = 20) were treated with six intravenous infusions of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) administered over 40 min. Anhedonia was measured through the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). The antianhedonic response and remission were defined as ≥ 50% and ≥ 75% reduction in MADRS anhedonia subscale score one day after the sixth infusion, respectively. Results: Anti-anhedonic response and remission rates after the sixth ketamine infusion were 48.5% (95% confidence interval = 38.3%–58.6%) and 30.9% (95% confidence interval = 21.6%–40.3%), respectively. When compared to baseline, a significant reduction in the MADRS anhedonia subscale score was observed at 4 h after the first infusion and was maintained with repeated infusions at any time point (all Ps < 0.05). The anti-anhedonic effect of ketamine did not differ between the MDD and BD groups. Conclusion: This preliminary study found that repeated ketamine infusions appeared to be effective at rapidly ameliorating anhedonia, with similar efficacy in MDD and BD.

8387,"Midazolam attenuates ketamine-induced abnormal perception and thought process but not mood changes.^\nPURPOSE: To determine the effects of midazolam, 30 ngxmL(-1), on altered perception, mood, and cognition induced by ketamine. METHODS: After ketamine was administered to achieve target concentrations of 50, 100, or 150 ngxmL in 11 volunteers, perception, mood, and thought process were assessed by a visual analog scale. Mini-Mental State examination (MMSE) assessed cognition. Boluses of midazolam, 30, 14.5, and 12 microgxkg(-1), were injected every 30 min to maintain the plasma concentration at 30 ngxmL(-1), which was reached 30 min after each injection. RESULTS: Ketamine produced changes in perception about the body (P < 0.01, 0.001, and 0.0001 at 30, 60, and 90 min), surroundings (P < 0.01 and 0.0001 at 60 and 90 min), time (P < 0.002 and 0.0001 at 60 and 90 min), reality (P < 0.001 and 0.0001 at 60 and 90 min), sounds (P < 0.002 at 90 min), and meaning (P < 0.05 at 90 min). Subjects felt less energetic and clearheaded (P < 0.02 and 0.05) during ketamine, midazolam, and their co-administration. Ketamine impaired thought process (P < 0.003 and 0.0001 at 60 and 90 min). Ketamine and midazolam decreased mean total MMSE and recall scores (P < 0.001 for both). Co-administration reduced the number of subjects with perceptual (body, P < 0.01 and 0.001 at 30 and 60 min) and thought process abnormalities.

7460,"Microdosing psychedelics: Demographics, practices, and psychiatric comorbidities.^\nRATIONALE: Microdosing psychedelics - the practice of consuming small, sub-hallucinogenic doses of substances such as LSD or psilocybin - is gaining attention in popular media but remains poorly characterized. Contemporary studies of psychedelic microdosing have yet to report the basic psychiatric descriptors of psychedelic microdosers. OBJECTIVES: To examine the practices and demographics of a population of psychedelic microdosers - including their psychiatric diagnoses, prescription medications, and recreational substance use patterns - to develop a foundation on which to conduct future clinical research. METHODS: Participants (n = 909; M(age) = 26.9, SD = 8.6; male = 83.2%; White/European = 79.1%) recruited primarily from the online forum Reddit completed an anonymous online survey. Respondents who reported using LSD, psilocybin, or both for microdosing were grouped and compared with non-microdosing respondents using exploratory odds ratio testing on demographic variables, rates of psychiatric diagnoses, and past-year recreational substance use. RESULTS: Of microdosers, most reported using LSD (59.3%; M(dose) = 13 mcg, or 11.3% of one tab) or psilocybin (25.9%; M(dose) = 0.3 g of dried psilocybin mushrooms) on a one-day-on, two-days-off schedule. Compared with non-microdosers, microdosers were significantly less likely to report a history of substance use disorders (SUDs; OR = 0.17 (95% CI: 0.05-0.56)) or anxiety disorders (OR = 0.61 (95% CI: 0.41-0.91)). Microdosers were also more likely to report recent recreational substance use compared with non-microdosers (OR = 5.2 (95% CI: 2.7-10.8)).

4755,"Serotonergic neurotransmission in emotional processing: New evidence from long-term recreational poly-drug ecstasy use.^\nThe brain's serotonergic system plays a crucial role in the processing of emotional stimuli, and several studies have shown that a reduced serotonergic neurotransmission is associated with an increase in amygdala activity during emotional face processing. Prolonged recreational use of ecstasy (3,4-methylene-dioxymethamphetamine [MDMA]) induces alterations in serotonergic neurotransmission that are comparable to those observed in a depleted state. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we investigated the responsiveness of the amygdala to emotional face stimuli in recreational ecstasy users as a model of long-term serotonin depletion. Fourteen ecstasy users and 12 non-using controls underwent fMRI to measure the regional neural activity elicited in the amygdala by male or female faces expressing anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or no emotion. During fMRI, participants made a sex judgement on each face stimulus. Positron emission tomography with 11C-DASB was additionally performed to assess serotonin transporter (SERT) binding in the brain. In the ecstasy users, SERT binding correlated negatively with amygdala activity, and accumulated lifetime intake of ecstasy tablets was associated with an increase in amygdala activity during angry face processing. Conversely, time since the last ecstasy intake was associated with a trend toward a decrease in amygdala activity during angry and sad face processing. These results indicate that the effects of long-term serotonin depletion resulting from ecstasy use are dose-dependent, affecting the functional neural basis of emotional face processing.",3,"[0.0059798965230584145, 0.003011463675647974, 0.0012934141559526324, 0.9723016023635864, 0.007605253718793392, 0.0003989586839452386, 0.0025798955466598272, 0.001082875649444759, 0.0015640993369743228, 0.002344069303944707, 0.001838459400460124]",3
6325,"Ketamine and Other NMDA Antagonists: Early Clinical Trials and Possible Mechanisms in Depression.^\nOBJECTIVE: The authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of ketamine and other N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists in the treatment of major depression. METHOD: Searches of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and other databases were conducted for placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trials of NMDA antagonists in the treatment of depression. Primary outcomes were rates of treatment response and transient remission of symptoms. Secondary outcomes included change in depression symptom severity and the frequency and severity of dissociative and psychotomimetic effects. Results for each NMDA antagonist were combined in meta-analyses, reporting odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes and standardized mean differences for continuous outcomes. RESULTS: Ketamine (seven trials encompassing 147 ketamine-treated participants) produced a rapid, yet transient, antidepressant effect, with odds ratios for response and transient remission of symptoms at 24 hours equaling 9.87 (4.37-22.29) and 14.47 (2.67-78.49), respectively, accompanied by brief psychotomimetic and dissociative effects. Ketamine augmentation of ECT (five trials encompassing 89 ketamine-treated participants) significantly reduced depressive symptoms following an initial treatment (Hedges' g=0.933) but not at the conclusion of the ECT course. Other NMDA antagonists failed to consistently demonstrate efficacy; however, two partial agonists at the NMDA coagonist site, d-cycloserine and rapastinel, significantly reduced depressive symptoms without psychotomimetic or dissociative effects. CONCLUSIONS: The antidepressant efficacy of ketamine, and perhaps D-cycloserine and rapastinel, holds promise for future glutamate-modulating strategies; however, the ineffectiveness of other NMDA antagonists suggests that any forthcoming advances will depend on improving our understanding of ketamine's mechanism of action. The fleeting nature of ketamine's therapeutic benefit, coupled with its potential for abuse and neurotoxicity, suggest that its use in the clinical setting warrants caution.",1,"[0.002212516963481903, 0.8831039667129517, 0.06982099264860153, 0.002511383965611458, 0.002444447949528694, 0.006707737222313881, 0.0031990644056349993, 0.004420778248459101, 0.0046263281255960464, 0.004104367457330227, 0.01684846729040146]",1
7035,"A Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)-Guided Dashboard to Review Psilocybin Target Domains: A Systematic Review.^\nBACKGROUND: Preliminary results from randomized controlled studies as well as identified molecular, cellular, and circuit targets of select psychedelics (e.g., psilocybin) suggest that their effects are transdiagnostic. In this review, we exploit the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) transdiagnostic framework, to synthesize extant literature on psilocybin. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify RDoC-based effects of psilocybin and vistas for future mechanistic and interventional research. METHODS: A systematic search in electronic databases (i.e., PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Web of Science) performed in January and February 2021 identified English articles published between 1990 and 2020 reporting the effects of psilocybin on mental health measures. Data from included articles were retrieved and organized according to the RDoC bio-behavioral matrix and its constituent six main domains, namely: positive valence systems, negative valence systems, cognitive systems, social processes, sensorimotor systems, and arousal and regulatory systems. RESULTS: The preponderance of research with psilocybin has differentially reported beneficial effects on positive valence systems, negative valence system, and social process domains. The data from the included studies support both short-term (23 assessments) and long-term (15 assessments) beneficial effects of psilocybin on the positive valence systems. While 12 of the extracted outcome measures suggest that psilocybin use is associated with increases in the ""fear"" construct of the negative valence systems domain, 19 findings show no significant effects on this construct, and seven parameters show lowered levels of the ""sustained threat"" construct in the long term. Thirty-four outcome measures revealed short-term alterations in the social systems' construct namely, ""perception and understanding of self,"" and ""social communications"" as well as enhancements in ""perception and understanding of others"" and ""affiliation and attachment"". The majority of findings related to the cognitive systems' domain reported dyscognitive effects. There have been relatively few studies reporting outcomes of psilocybin on the remaining RDoC domains. Moreover, seven of the included studies suggest the transdiagnostic effects of psilocybin. The dashboard characterization of RDoC outcomes with psilocybin suggests beneficial effects in the measures of reward, threat, and arousal, as well as general social systems. CONCLUSIONS: Psilocybin possesses a multi-domain effectiveness. The field would benefit from highly rigorous proof-of-mechanism research to assess the effects of psilocybin using the RDoC framework.

8087,"A single-infusion of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine improves fatigue scores in patients with bipolar disorder compared to placebo.^\nBackground: Fatigue is a highly prevalent residual symptom of depression that is difficult to treat with current monoaminergic antidepressants. Research has shown that ketamine, an N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that manipulates the glutamate system, produces rapid, robust, and moderately sustained improvements in depressive symptoms. However, there is a dearth of literature examining the effects of ketamine on fatigue specifically. We hypothesized that ketamine would rapidly improve fatigue symptoms in treatment‐resistant bipolar depressed patients. Methods: In a double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled, crossover study, 36 participants with treatment‐resistant bipolar depression (maintained on therapeutic levels of lithium or valproate) received a single intravenous infusion of ketamine hydrochloride at a dose of 0.5mg/kg over 40 minutes or placebo on 2 experimental days separated by 2 weeks. A post‐hoc analysis compared fatigue scores on ketamine vs. placebo from 40 minutes through 14 days using a novel scale (based on questions from validated rating scales). Results: A linear mixed model showed that patients had significantly lower fatigue scores following ketamine compared to placebo from 40 minutes (p=.002) through day 3 (p<.001). The drug difference was not significant at day 7 (p=.10), but it was at day 10 (p=.03) and 14 (p=.004). The largest difference was at day 2 (p<.001; d=.58). Conclusions: Ketamine rapidly and significantly improved fatigue symptoms relative to placebo in a group of treatment‐resistant bipolar depressed patients.

2490,"Real-world effectiveness of repeated ketamine infusions for treatment-resistant bipolar depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Clinical trials have demonstrated rapid antidepressant effects with intravenous (IV) ketamine for major depressive disorder, with relatively less research specifically for bipolar depression. Herein, we describe the real-world effectiveness of repeated ketamine infusions for treatment-resistant bipolar depression. METHODS: This study was conducted in a community clinic in Mississauga, Ontario (Canadian Rapid Treatment Centre of Excellence; Braxia Health). In this observational study (NCT04209296), patients with treatment-resistant bipolar I/II depression (n = 66) received four sub-anesthetic doses of IV ketamine (0.5-0.75 mg/kg) over a two-week period. Symptoms of depression, suicidality, anxiety, and functioning were assessed with validated self-report measures. RESULTS: Statistically and clinically significant antidepressant effects were observed in the overall sample, as measured by the Quick Inventory for Depression Symptomatology-Self Report-16 (QIDS-SR(16) ) with further reductions in depressive symptoms observed after each subsequent infusion (n = 66; mean QIDS-SR(16) reduction of 6.08+/-1.39; p < 0.0001). Significant reductions of suicidal thoughts (QIDS-SR(16) -Suicide Item) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) were also observed with functional improvements on the Sheehan Disability Scale (p < 0.0001 on all measures). Moreover, the response rate (QIDS-SR(16) total score decrease ≥50% from baseline) was 35% and remission rate (QIDS-SR(16) total score ≤5) was 20% after four infusions.

8247,"Acute and chronic effects of ketamine on semantic priming: modeling schizophrenia?.^\nAcute administration of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine induces schizophrenia-like symptoms in healthy volunteers; furthermore, a window on ketamine's chronic effects is provided by regular recreational users. The current study utilized both acute ketamine administration in healthy volunteers and chronic ketamine abusers to investigate semantic processing, one of the key cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. Semantic processing was examined using a semantic priming paradigm. In experiment 1, acute effects of low (75 ng/mL) and high (150 ng/mL) ketamine doses were compared in a placebo-controlled double-blind independent group design with 48 participants. In experiment 2, 19 regular recreational ketamine users were compared with 19 ketamine-naive polydrug controls and 26 non-drug-using controls. In both experiments, semantic priming parameters were manipulated to distinguish between ketamine's effects on (1) automatic and strategic processing and (2) the facilitation and inhibition components of semantic priming for strongly (directly) related primes and targets. Acute effects of ketamine on semantic priming for weakly (indirectly) related primes and targets were also assessed in experiment 1. Acutely, ketamine impaired the employment of strategic mechanisms but not automatic processing within both the direct and indirect semantic priming tasks. Acute ketamine administration also induced clear schizophrenia-like symptoms. Schizotypy traits in the cognitive and perceptual domains tended to correlate with increased semantic priming in long-term ketamine users. In summary, acute and chronic ketamine-induced changes partially mirrored the findings on semantic priming in schizophrenia.",4,"[0.0019568155985325575, 0.004103795625269413, 0.008164653554558754, 0.003251792164519429, 0.9395375847816467, 0.004172959364950657, 0.024405252188444138, 0.005275188013911247, 0.004871258977800608, 0.002403484657406807, 0.0018571026157587767]",1
4876,"The association between stage of treatment-resistant depression and clinical utility of ketamine/esketamine: A systematic review.^\nOBJECTIVE: Ketamine has demonstrated rapid and significant antidepressant effects in patients with treatment resistant depression (TRD). Herein, we conducted a systematic review to determine ketamine's efficacy as a function of the stage of treatment resistance (e.g., number of failed treatments) among individuals with TRD. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed and Scopus from inception to August 2021 was conducted. Where applicable, the studies were categorized into low and high stages of resistance, where low category included studies where the mean number of failed antidepressants was <3 or had a higher proportion of subjects with ≤2 antidepressant trials. Reported indicators of treatment resistance and efficacy were extracted from randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) assessing ketamine or esketamine for TRD. RESULTS: In total, 18 RCTs were included in the current review. There was variability across reported indicators of disease severity, definition of treatment resistance, as well as treatment protocols, preventing clear direct and indirect comparison of relative efficacy of ketamine at different stages of treatment resistance. Ketamine was effective in reducing depressive symptoms in RCTs at both lower and higher stages of treatment resistance; however, the effect size and duration of effects was greater in RCTs of lower stage of treatment resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that ketamine has antidepressant efficacy across all identified stages of treatment resistance, however with increasing failed treatment trials, treatment might be less efficacious. At this time, the comparative efficacy as a function of resistance stage remains to be well-established. Evaluation of participant level data is required to more clearly determine the association between level of treatment resistance and likelihood of response.",8,"[0.001999463653191924, 0.0007484803791157901, 0.0036153269466012716, 0.0015560585306957364, 0.0036096270196139812, 0.002308012917637825, 0.0025868555530905724, 0.0027778076473623514, 0.9754971265792847, 0.002032242948189378, 0.0032690907828509808]",8

5794,"Neural correlates of the severity of cocaine, heroin, alcohol, MDMA and cannabis use in polysubstance abusers: A resting-PET brain metabolism study.^\nIntroduction: Functional imaging studies of addiction following protracted abstinence have not been systematically conducted to look at the associations between severity of use of different drugs and brain dysfunction. Findings from such studies may be relevant to implement specific interventions for treatment. The aim of this study was to examine the association between resting-state regional brain metabolism (measured with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) and the severity of use of cocaine, heroin, alcohol, MDMA and cannabis in a sample of polysubstance users with prolonged abstinence from all drugs used. Methods: Our sample consisted of 49 polysubstance users enrolled in residential treatment. We conducted correlation analyses between estimates of use of cocaine, heroin, alcohol, MDMA and cannabis and brain metabolism (BM) (using Statistical Parametric Mapping voxel-based (VB) whole-brain analyses). In all correlation analyses conducted for each of the drugs we controlled for the co-abuse of the other drugs used. Results: The analysis showed significant negative correlations between severity of heroin, alcohol, MDMA and cannabis use and BM in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and temporal cortex. Alcohol use was further associated with lower metabolism in frontal premotor cortex and putamen, and stimulants use with parietal cortex. Conclusions: Duration of use of different drugs negatively correlated with overlapping regions in the DLPFC, whereas severity of cocaine, heroin and alcohol use selectively impact parietal, temporal, and frontal-premotor/basal ganglia regions respectively. The knowledge of these associations could be useful in the clinical practice since different brain alterations have been associated with different patterns of execution that may affect the rehabilitation of these patients. © 2012 Moreno-López et al.",4,"[0.0017703714547678828, 0.0030181247275322676, 0.008173340931534767, 0.003582475008442998, 0.9571040272712708, 0.0035673188976943493, 0.008624313399195671, 0.004191518295556307, 0.005426103249192238, 0.0029045622795820236, 0.0016378241125494242]",4

In the last decade, it has been suggested that subdissociative-dose ketamine is a fast-acting antidepressant. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of low-dose ketamine administered during caesarean section in preventing postpartum depression. METHODS: Using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, 330 parturients who were scheduled to undergo caesarean section were enrolled in this trial. The parturients were randomly assigned to receive intravenous ketamine (0.25 mg/kg diluted to 10 mL with 0.9% saline) or placebo (10 mL of 0.9% saline) within 5 min following clamping of the neonatal umbilical cord. The primary outcome was the degree of depression, which was evaluated using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) (a threshold of 9/10 was used) at 3 days and 6 weeks after delivery. The secondary outcome was the numeric rating scale score of pain at 3 day and 6 week postpartum. RESULTS: No significant differences were found in the prevalence of postpartum depression between the two groups at 3 days and 6 weeks after delivery. The pain scores measured at 3 days postoperatively were not significantly different between the groups, whereas the scores measured at 6 week postpartum were significantly reduced in the treatment group compared with the saline group (P = 0.014).

2998,"Ketamine's dose-related effects on anxiety symptoms in patients with treatment refractory anxiety disorders.^\nThe N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine has rapid onset activity in treatment-resistant depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. Due to similarities in brain network activity in depression and anxiety disorders, we hypothesized that ketamine might also be active in other refractory anxiety disorders. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of ketamine in 12 patients with refractory generalized anxiety disorder and/or social anxiety disorder who were not currently depressed, using an ascending single dose study design (0.25, 0.5, 1 mg/kg administered subcutaneously) at weekly intervals. Within 1 h of dosing, patients reported reduced anxiety, which persisted for up to seven days. A dose-response profile was noted for anxiolytic effects, dissociative side effects, and changes in blood pressure and heart rate, with minor changes at 0.25 mg/kg, and progressively greater and more durable changes at the higher doses. Ten of 12 patients were treatment responders at 0.5-1 mg/kg. Ketamine was safe and well tolerated in this population. Ketamine may be a potential therapeutic alternative for patients with refractory generalized anxiety disorder/social anxiety disorder. Along with its demonstrated effectiveness in patients with treatment-resistant depression, obsessive compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, these data raise the intriguing possibility that ketamine may have broad efficacy in disorders characterized by negative emotional states, and that these disorders may share a common precipitating neurobiology.",0,"[0.9904388785362244, 0.0008527032914571464, 0.0005771665601059794, 0.0013873209245502949, 0.000802811817266047, 0.0008712898124940693, 0.0007514767348766327, 0.0020300247706472874, 0.0008033521589823067, 0.0008413588511757553, 0.0006437257397919893]",0
8143,"The use of classic psychedelics among adults: a Danish online survey study.^\nBACKGROUND: Clinical studies report preliminary therapeutic effects of classic psychedelic drugs in several psychiatric conditions and international drug trends show increased use of these compounds. However, the epidemiology of classic psychedelic drug use in Scandinavian countries remains sparsely investigated. To this end, we investigated the patterns of use and the subjectively perceived acute and persisting effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin, N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), and mescaline, among Danish adults. METHODS: An anonymous online survey with 152 items was conducted using the secure survey web application REDCap. Results were presented descriptively and as comparisons between psychedelic drugs. RESULTS: Five-hundred participants (30.0% female, mean age 34.5 years) were included. Classic psychedelics were mostly used with therapeutic (28.0%) or spiritual (27.2%) intentions. Sixty-seven per cent used classic psychedelics once a year or less. Most participants (56.4%) preferred using psilocybin. Classic psychedelic use was for some individuals, associated with hazardous use of alcohol (39.4%). Among participants with a psychiatric treatment history, 80.9% reported subjective improvements in symptoms following classic psychedelic use. Participants' most memorable experiences were moderate-to-strong mystical-type experiences (MEQ30 mean ± SD 3.4 ± 1.0; range 1-5) and had positive persisting effects on well-being (mean ± SD 2.1 ± 1.0), social relationships (mean ± SD 1.7 ± 1.2), meaning of life (mean ± SD 1.9 ± 1.1), and mood (mean ± SD 1.8 ± 1.1); range -3 to 3. DMT users experienced significantly greater subjective positive effects.

2669,"Modulation of simultaneously collected hemodynamic and electrophysiological functional connectivity by ketamine and midazolam.^\nThe pharmacological modulation of functional connectivity in the brain may underlie therapeutic efficacy for several neurological and psychiatric disorders. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides a noninvasive method of assessing this modulation, however, the indirect nature of the blood-oxygen level dependent signal restricts the discrimination of neural from physiological contributions. Here we followed two approaches to assess the validity of fMRI functional connectivity in developing drug biomarkers, using simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG)/fMRI in a placebo-controlled, three-way crossover design with ketamine and midazolam. First, we compared seven different preprocessing pipelines to determine their impact on the connectivity of common resting-state networks. Independent components analysis (ICA)-denoising resulted in stronger reductions in connectivity after ketamine, and weaker increases after midazolam, than pipelines employing physiological noise modelling or averaged signals from cerebrospinal fluid or white matter. This suggests that pipeline decisions should reflect a drug's unique noise structure, and if this is unknown then accepting possible signal loss when choosing extensive ICA denoising pipelines could engender more confidence in the remaining results. We then compared the temporal correlation structure of fMRI to that derived from two connectivity metrics of EEG, which provides a direct measure of neural activity. While electrophysiological estimates based on the power envelope were more closely aligned to BOLD signal connectivity than those based on phase consistency, no significant relationship between the change in electrophysiological and hemodynamic correlation structures was found, implying caution should be used when making cross-modal comparisons of pharmacologically-modulated functional connectivity.",9,"[0.0012064229231327772, 0.0025692095514386892, 0.0007682428695261478, 0.0020741538610309362, 0.0013705861056223512, 0.002119585871696472, 0.0009224286768585443, 0.0022356032859534025, 0.0008700803737156093, 0.9847905039787292, 0.0010732405353337526]",9

8913,"5-HT modulation of dopamine release in basal ganglia in psilocybin-induced psychosis in man--a PET study with [11C]raclopride.^\nThe modulating effects of serotonin on dopamine neurotransmission are not well understood, particularly in acute psychotic states. Positron emission tomography was used to examine the effect of psilocybin on the in vivo binding of [11C]raclopride to D2-dopamine receptors in the striatum in healthy volunteers after placebo and a psychotomimetic dose of psilocybin (n = 7). Psilocybin is a potent indoleamine hallucinogen and a mixed 5-HT2A and 5-HT1A receptor agonist. Psilocybin administration (0.25 mg/kg p.o.) produced changes in mood, disturbances in thinking, illusions, elementary and complex visual hallucinations and impaired ego-functioning. Psilocybin significantly decreased [11C]raclopride receptor binding potential (BP) bilaterally in the caudate nucleus (19%) and putamen (20%) consistent with an increase in endogenous dopamine. Changes in [11C]raclopride BP in the ventral striatum correlated with depersonalization associated with euphoria. Together with previous reports of 5-HT receptor involvement in striatal dopamine release, it is concluded that stimulation of both 5-HT2A and 5-HT1A receptors may be important for the modulation of striatal dopamine release in acute psychoses. The present results indirectly support the hypothesis of a serotonin-dopamine dysbalance in schizophrenia and suggest that psilocybin is a valuable tool in the analysis of serotonin-dopamine interactions in acute psychotic states.",0,"[0.9897554516792297, 0.0006614472367800772, 0.0004959767102263868, 0.0024636031594127417, 0.0011223176261410117, 0.0008489138563163579, 0.0008690763497725129, 0.0015543263871222734, 0.0008165010949596763, 0.0008806550758890808, 0.0005316640017554164]",0

4885,"HOPE: A Pilot Study of Psilocybin Enhanced Group Psychotherapy in Patients With Cancer.^\nCONTEXT/OBJECTIVES: Psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy shows promise in treating depression and existential distress in people with serious medical illness. However, its individual-based methodology poses challenges for scaling and resource availability. The HOPE trial (A Pilot Study of Psilocybin Enhanced Group Psychotherapy in Patients with Cancer) is an Institutional Review Boards-approved open-label feasibility and safety pilot study examining psilocybin-assisted group therapy in cancer patients with a DSM-5 depressive disorder (including major depressive disorder as well as adjustment disorder with depressed mood). We report here the safety and clinical outcome measures including six-months follow up data. METHODS: Outcome measures were collected at baseline, two-weeks and 26-weeks postintervention. The study involved three group preparatory sessions, one high-dose (25 mg) group psilocybin session, and three group integration sessions with cohorts of four participants over a three-week intervention. RESULTS: Twelve participants completed the trial. no serious adverse events attributed to psilocybin occurred. The primary clinical outcome measures of change in symptoms of depression on the clinician administered 17-item-HAM-D showed clinically substantial decrease in HAM-D scores from baseline to the two-week timepoint (21.5-10.09, P < 0.001) and the 26-week timepoint (21.5-14.83, P = 0.006). Six out of 12 participants met criteria for remission at two weeks, as defined by HAM-D < 7, three out 12 demonstrated a clinically significant change (4-6 points), and eight out of twelve demonstrated a clinically substantial change (7-12 points). CONCLUSION: This pilot study demonstrated the safety, feasibility, and possible efficacy of psilocybin-assisted group therapy for cancer patients dealing with depressive symptoms. Based on demonstrated efficacy and significant reductions in therapist time, future investigations with the group therapy model are warranted.",0,"[0.9905555844306946, 0.000864856643602252, 0.0005328880506567657, 0.001685462542809546, 0.0007418068707920611, 0.0008010757737793028, 0.0006682086968794465, 0.0018743880791589618, 0.0007842660415917635, 0.0008883779519237578, 0.0006031258380971849]",0

Esketamine administration (0.5 mg/kg, IV or SC) took 40 minutes, followed by an observation time of 2 hours. Blood pressure and emergent side effects were constantly monitored by a trained psychiatrist. The Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was used to assess the severity of depressive symptoms (total score) and SI (item 10) before esketamine administration and after 24 hours. Records from 10 patients were included. Eight patients receive SC esketamine, whereas the remaining received IV. The mean age of the sample was 15.5 years. There was a significant reduction in depressive symptoms (mean total MADRS score) from baseline to 24-hour postadministration (39.1 ± 6.30 to 26.8 ± 8.40; mean difference = 12.3; t = 4.22; p = 0.002; d = 1.33). In addition, we found a significant decrease in SI (mean MADRS item 10 score) when comparing baseline and 24-hour results (5.0 ± 1.16 to 2.7 ± 1.95; mean difference = 2.3; t = 3.14; p = 0.011; d = 0.99). Most patients reported side effects only during esketamine ad ministration or following the observational period. Dissociation was the most frequently self-reported symptom (50%), followed by dizziness (40%) and drowsiness (30%). Side effects were considered mild to moderate since they were short-lived, and no patients had treatment-emergent SI or suicidal behavior. This is the first report of a rapid onset antidepressant and antisuicidal effect of esketamine in depressed adolescents. The few studies that investigated the antisuicidal effects of ketamine in this population used the racemate and were restricted to single case reports. Nonetheless, repeated ketamine infusions in adolescents with treatment-resistant depression appear to improve depressive symptoms and SI. The results suggest that a single dose of parenteral esketamine can rapidly reduce the severity of depression and SI symptoms in adolescents with MDD and SI. Regardless, larger adequately controlled studies are needed, in addition to the investigation of multiple administrations of esketamine, and its long-term safety for this age group in different aspects, such as cognitive impairment and risk of recreational use.

5641,"A retrospective naturalistic study comparing the efficacy of ketamine and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for treatment-resistant depression.^\nDepression is a common mental disorder that affects many people worldwide, while a significant proportion of patients remain non-responsive to antidepressant medications. Alternative treatment options such as ketamine therapy and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) therapy are offered nowadays. This study aims to describe and compare the acute antidepressive efficacy of both, intramuscular ketamine and rTMS in depression patients seeking help in a naturalistic clinical mental health setting. The clinical records of 24 patients with treatment resistant depression were collected from the clinical base of a real life clinic. Twelve patients were treated with intramuscular ketamine, twice weekly for 8 sessions, and twelve patients were treated with 30 sessions of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex—intermittent theta-burst stimulation (DLPFC-iTBS). Using three clinical assessments (HDRS, HAM-A, BDI-II), our data reveal that both therapies led to significant improvement in symptoms from pre- to post-treatment, as well as that the two experimental groups did not differ significantly with respect to pre- to post-depressive and anxiety symptoms, indicating that the effect of both experimental groups in our sample was equally effective. Furthermore, our results showed high remission and response rates in both groups, with no statistical differences between the patients of ketamine group and rTMS group in remission and response rates. We show a significant pre- to post-treatment reduction in depressive and anxiety symptoms, with no significant differences between the two experimental groups, indicating that the effect of both therapies was equally effective in our limited sample.

2784,"MDMA increases recruitment of social brain areas when interacting with cooperative players during an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma.^\nIntroduction: The iterated Prisoner's Dilemma is used to investigate trust, cooperation and responses to violations of these concepts; one among a number of social decision‐making tasks which are increasingly being used to study social cognition. The psychopharmacology of the processes underlying behaviour in these tasks is poorly understood. To address this, we carried out a functional neuroimaging study investigating the effect of the potent serotonergic compound, 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), on cooperation and trust in an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (iPD). Methods: Twenty, healthy, male participants were enrolled in to this double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study. 100mg MDMA or placebo was administered prior to playing an iPD during fMRI scanning. Participants played repeated rounds with 'trustworthy' (mostly cooperative) and 'untrustworthy' (mostly uncooperative) opponents, as well as a non‐social control. On each round participants were asked to Compete or Cooperate, received feedback as to the other player's decision, and were asked to rate their trust in the other player. Results: MDMA increased cooperation when playing the trustworthy opponents (OR = 2.01 (1.46 ‐ 2.96), p < 0.001), but not when playing untrustworthy opponents (OR = 1.25 (0.73 ‐ 2.13)) or the non‐social control (OR = 1.05 (0.72 ‐ 1.54)). There was no effect of MDMA on trust ratings. When receiving feedback of the trustworthy players' decisions, MDMA increased activity in regions involved with social cognition, including the mid‐cingulate gyrus, supplementary motor area, superior temporal sulcus, and bilateral insula. Restricting the analysis to just cooperative feedback from trustworthy players did not appreciably alter the results but revealed increased bilateral putamen activation. No other contrasts showed statistically significant results. Discussion: Increased engagement of social brain regions on MDMA underlies greater tolerance for untrustworthy behaviour of cooperative partners. Furthermore, higher activation of the putamen in response to cooperative behaviour suggests greater social reward processing on MDMA. These results provide evidence for some opponent and process dependent specificity in the role of serotonin in social interactions.",0,"[0.9901816248893738, 0.0007365611381828785, 0.0005139595596119761, 0.0026842865627259016, 0.0007870495319366455, 0.0007488772971555591, 0.000690180400852114, 0.0015497800195589662, 0.0007242420106194913, 0.0008111628703773022, 0.0005722604691982269]",0

In Brazil, harmful use and dependence on alcohol reach about 10% of the population, with alcohol being one of the main factors of disease and mortality. Although the medications currently used have some efficacy, the adverse effects and relatively long time of treatment are factors that may reduce patients' motivation to continue taking the medication correctly. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct research with new drugs for the treatment of alcoholism. Ibogaine is an alkaloid present in the bush Tabernanthe iboga (iboga), a plant from Central Africa traditionally used in countries such as Gabon and Cameroon. Animal studies and case series suggest that one or a few doses of ibogaine significantly reduce withdrawal symptoms and the intensity of use of various drugs, including opioids, psychostimulants, and alcohol. However, there are no controlled clinical studies that have explored these effects. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of increasing doses of ibogaine in 12 alcoholic patients. Each patient will be hospitalized for 20 days and receive 3 increasing doses of ibogaine. The first 3 patients will receive oral doses of 20 to 400 mg of ibogaine in an open‐label design.

591,"Prediction of repeated-dose intravenous ketamine response in major depressive disorder using the GWAS-based machine learning approach.^\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common psychiatric disorders. Various clinical studies have shown that the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine has rapid, robust, and sustained antidepressant effects. However, given the concerns about the adverse effects of ketamine on patients, it would be important to identify a set of biomarkers that could be used to predict clinical outcomes for its treatment. A total of 83 MDD patients received treatment with six ketamine infusions for up to 2 weeks and were classified into ""responders"" or ""non-responders"" based on an average change in the HAMD score >50% from baseline. A nested cross-validation approach was applied to prevent information leakage and overestimation of model performance. The initial dataset was divided randomly into training and test sets in a nested six-fold cross-validation. We first performed genome-wide logistic regression to find potentially significant variants related to treatment response and then selected the top SNPs based on the genetic association results using the random forests algorithm. Subsequently, six machine learning models were employed to construct prediction models by using ten-fold cross-validation. A series of model comparisons showed that the best performing fold was characterized by accuracy of 0.85, precision of 0.75, and a sensitivity of 1.00 with the support vector machine algorithm. Together, these findings demonstrated that the machine learning approach can predict the treatment outcomes of multiple ketamine infusions on the basis of the genotyping information of each participant.",7,"[0.009624435566365719, 0.013721891678869724, 0.0050954255275428295, 0.0031471967231482267, 0.005453622434288263, 0.016692163422703743, 0.34292733669281006, 0.5846744775772095, 0.0068090856075286865, 0.007436541840434074, 0.004417855758219957]",7
5760,"Self reported sleep quality and cognitive performance in ecstasy users.^\nObjectives: Research suggests that ecstasy users exhibit psychobiological changes relative to nonusers such as altered sleep patterns and cognitive deficits. In turn, it has been suggested that sleep quality may be a mediator of such cognitive deficits in ecstasy users. The present study sought to investigate this proposed relationship. Methods: Aspects of cognitive functioning in 104 ecstasy users and 103 nonusers obtained from our previous studies were reanalysed to explore the extent to which ecstasy-related group differences were attributable to differences in sleep quality. Cognitive function was assessed via the computation span test, consonant updating, paired associate learning, syllogistic reasoning and word fluency. Sleep quality was measured via the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). Results: Ecstasy users performed worse than nonusers on all cognitive measures. While no differences were observed on the ESS, ecstasy users reported greater tiredness at the beginning of testing than nonusers. When the sleep variables were included as covariates, the effects of ecstasy on all cognitive measures remained significant. Conclusions: The results of the present study suggest little evidence for the mediating effects of sleep on cognitive function in ecstasy users.

4236,"The efficacy of oral ketamine in severely depressed patients at high risk of suicide.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is most easily and inexpensively administered by the oral route and in racemic form. Oral racemic ketamine may be an important approach to the emergency management of suicide risk in clinical settings, especially in third world countries, that have a limited range of available healthcare resources. METHODS: In a prospective, uncontrolled, open-label investigation, we studied 30 severely depressed inpatients who consented to participate in a pilot hospital service offering ketamine for management of high suicide risk. Patients sipped a solution of racemic ketamine (150 mg) across 10-15 min in 3 alternate day sessions. Patients were assessed using the Modified Scale for Suicidal Ideation (MSSI), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and Clinical Global Improvement-Severity (CGI-S) scale at baseline and 1 day after the last ketamine session. RESULTS: There was statistically and clinically significant improvement on all outcomes. Mean (standard deviation) MSSI scores dropped from 25.1(1.8) to 17.3(5.6), MADRS scores from 28.8(3.4) to 21.9(3.6), and CGI-S scores from 6.0(0.2) to 3.6(0.9). At endpoint, MSSI scores had dropped from severe to low or mild-to-moderate in 67% of patients. The 90 ketamine sessions were uneventful; the treatment was well tolerated and no patient dropped out.

3719,"Turn on, Tune in, and Drop out: Predictors of Attrition in a Prospective Observational Cohort Study on Psychedelic Use.^\nBACKGROUND: The resurgence of research and public interest in the positive psychological effects of psychedelics, together with advancements in digital data collection techniques, have brought forth a new type of research design, which involves prospectively gathering large-scale naturalistic data from psychedelic users; that is, before and after the use of a psychedelic compound. A methodological limitation of such studies is their high attrition rate, particularly owing to participants who stop responding after initial study enrollment. Importantly, study dropout can introduce systematic biases that may affect the interpretability of results. OBJECTIVE: Based on a previously collected sample (baseline n=654), here we investigated potential determinants of study attrition in web-based prospective studies on psychedelic use. METHODS: Logistic regression models were used to examine demographic, psychological trait and state, and psychedelic-specific predictors of dropout. Predictors were assessed 1 week before, 1 day after, and 2 weeks after psychedelic use, with attrition being defined as noncompletion of the key endpoint 4 weeks post experience. RESULTS: Predictors of attrition were found among demographic variables including age (β=0.024; P=.007) and educational levels, as well as personality traits, specifically conscientiousness (β=-0.079; P=.02) and extraversion (β=0.082; P=.01). Contrary to prior hypotheses, neither baseline attitudes toward psychedelics nor the intensity of acute challenging experiences were predictive of dropout. CONCLUSIONS: The baseline predictors of attrition identified here are consistent with those reported in longitudinal studies in other scientific disciplines, suggesting their transdisciplinary relevance. Moreover, the lack of an association between attrition and psychedelic advocacy or negative drug experiences in our sample contextualizes concerns about problematic biases in these and related data.",5,"[0.0054647475481033325, 0.006114813033491373, 0.012783657759428024, 0.001691660494543612, 0.005571725312620401, 0.8852465748786926, 0.03684927895665169, 0.018146825954318047, 0.005067308899015188, 0.00908668339252472, 0.013976624235510826]",5
4826,"Differential effects of rumination and distraction on ketamine induced modulation of resting state functional connectivity and reactivity of regions within the default-mode network.^\nDistraction and rumination are distinct response styles that determine how an individual deals with negative thoughts and feelings. Rumination is accompanied by an elevated self-focus, which is associated with increased resting state functional connectivity and decreased reactivity within the default mode network. Interestingly, the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine reduces functional connectivity in this network, while its effects on blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses during stimulus perception are not known. Ketamine might lead to a more variable processing of the external world with an attenuated self-focus by reducing the resting state connectivity. Here, we used an emotional picture-viewing task in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging to test the hypothesis that a single ketamine administration to healthy subjects increases BOLD reactivity to negative stimuli. We found a region specific increase in BOLD reactivity in the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex and not in a posterior control region after ketamine compared with placebo administration. Moreover, a linear regression revealed that the increase in BOLD reactivity was more pronounced for subjects with a low ability to apply distraction during negative experiences. Our results implicate that ketamine attenuates a potentially pathological increased self-focus during negative experiences.

7381,"Effects of Ayahuasca on the Recognition of Facial Expressions of Emotions in Naive Healthy Volunteers: A Pilot, Proof-of-Concept, Randomized Controlled Trial.^\nBACKGROUND: The recognition of emotions in facial expressions (REFE) is a core aspect of social cognition. Previous studies with the serotonergic hallucinogens lysergic acid diethylamide and psilocybin showed that these drugs reduced the recognition of negative (fear) faces in healthy volunteers. This trial assessed the acute and prolonged effects of a single dose of ayahuasca on the REFE. METHODS: Twenty-two healthy volunteers participated in a pilot, proof-of-concept, randomized trial. Study variables included a REFE task performed before and 4 hours after drug intake, subjective effects (self-reports/observer impressions), tolerability measures (cardiovascular measures, self-reports), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor plasma levels. The REFE task was applied again 1, 7, 14, and 21 days and 3 months after drug intake. Stability of ayahuasca alkaloids during the study was also assessed (room temperature, 18 months). FINDINGS: Compared with placebo, ayahuasca did not modify the REFE. No significant effects were observed on cardiovascular measures and brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels. Volunteers reported visual effects, tranquility/relaxation, and well-being, with few reports of transient anxiety/confusion. Ayahuasca was well tolerated, producing mainly nausea, gastrointestinal discomfort, and vomiting. A significant time-dependent deterioration of alkaloids was observed, especially for dimethyltryptamine. CONCLUSIONS: Absence of significant effects on the REFE task could be due to lack of effects of ayahuasca (at the doses used), alkaloid degradation, learning effects, and the high educational level of the sample. Further trials with different samples are needed to better understand the effects of ayahuasca and other serotonergic hallucinogens on the REFE. Future trials should improve methods to guarantee the stability of ayahuasca alkaloids.",3,"[0.0018366932636126876, 0.0010262116556987166, 0.0014336943859234452, 0.9863924384117126, 0.004054700955748558, 0.00030367408180609345, 0.0012099497253075242, 0.00046789689804427326, 0.0009680238435976207, 0.0013579436345025897, 0.0009488160139881074]",3

This pharmacologically complex tea, commonly obtained from Banisteriopsis caapi and Psychotria viridis, combines N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), an orally labile psychedelic agent showing 5-hydroxytryptamine2A agonist activity, with monoamine oxidase (MAO)-inhibiting beta-carboline alkaloids (harmine, harmaline, and tetrahydroharmine). Eighteen volunteers with prior experience in the use of psychedelics received single oral doses of encapsulated freeze-dried ayahuasca (0.6 and 0.85 mg of DMT/kg of body weight) and placebo. Ayahuasca produced significant subjective effects, peaking between 1.5 and 2 h, involving perceptual modifications and increases in ratings of positive mood and activation. Diastolic blood pressure showed a significant increase at the high dose (9 mm Hg at 75 min), whereas systolic blood pressure and heart rate were moderately and nonsignificantly increased. Cmax values for DMT after the low and high ayahuasca doses were 12.14 ng/ml and 17.44 ng/ml, respectively. Tmax (median) was observed at 1.5 h after both doses. The Tmax for DMT coincided with the peak of subjective effects. Drug administration increased urinary normetanephrine excretion, but, contrary to the typical MAO-inhibitor effect profile, deaminated monoamine metabolite levels were not decreased. This and the negligible harmine plasma levels found suggest a predominantly peripheral (gastrointestinal and liver) site of action for harmine. MAO inhibition at this level would suffice to prevent first-pass metabolism of DMT and allow its access to systemic circulation and the central nervous system.",0,"[0.9909102320671082, 0.0007539791404269636, 0.0005010159802623093, 0.0018977316794916987, 0.0007196890073828399, 0.0008404970285482705, 0.0006333154742605984, 0.001602926291525364, 0.0007151102181524038, 0.0008546730387024581, 0.0005708526587113738]",0

These reports have generated several questions with respect to who might respond to ketamine, how, and for how long. To start answering these questions. We used PubMed.gov and ClinicalTrials.gov to perform a systematic review of all available published data on the antidepressant effects of ketamine and of all recently completed, ongoing, and planned studies. To date, 163 patients, primarily with treatment-resistant depression, have participated in case studies, open-label investigations, or controlled trials. All controlled trials have used a within-subject, crossover design with an inactive placebo as the control.

1077,"Deficits of long-term memory in ecstasy users are related to cognitive complexity of the task.^\nRationale: Despite animal evidence that methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy) causes lasting damage in brain regions related to long-term memory, results regarding human memory performance have been variable. This variability may reflect the cognitive complexity of the memory tasks. However, previous studies have tested only a limited range of cognitive complexity. Furthermore, comparisons across different studies are made difficult by regional variations in ecstasy composition and patterns of use. Objectives: The objective of this study is to evaluate ecstasy-related deficits in human verbal memory over a wide range of cognitive complexity using subjects drawn from a single geographical population. Materials and methods: Ecstasy users were compared to non-drug using controls on verbal tasks with low cognitive complexity (stem completion), moderate cognitive complexity (stem-cued recall and word list learning) and high cognitive complexity (California Verbal Learning Test, Verbal Paired Associates and a novel Verbal Triplet Associates test). Where significant differences were found, both groups were also compared to cannabis users. Results: More cognitively complex memory tasks were associated with clearer ecstasy-related deficits than low complexity tasks. In the most cognitively demanding task, ecstasy-related deficits remained even after multiple learning opportunities, whereas the performance of cannabis users approached that of non-drug using controls. Ecstasy users also had weaker deliberate strategy use than both non-drug and cannabis controls. Conclusions: Results were consistent with the proposal that ecstasy-related memory deficits are more reliable on tasks with greater cognitive complexity. This could arise either because such tasks require a greater contribution from the frontal lobe or because they require greater interaction between multiple brain regions. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",9,"[0.0008964005392044783, 0.004128591623157263, 0.0012903970200568438, 0.0012953388504683971, 0.0013598351506516337, 0.0027962764725089073, 0.001196720520965755, 0.0026479880325496197, 0.0010934675810858607, 0.9817343950271606, 0.0015606496017426252]",9

2539,"Efficacy of intravenous ketamine for treatment of chronic posttraumatic stress disorder: a randomized clinical trial.^\nIMPORTANCE: Few pharmacotherapies have demonstrated sufficient efficacy in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a chronic and disabling condition. OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy and safety of a single intravenous subanesthetic dose of ketamine for the treatment of PTSD and associated depressive symptoms in patients with chronic PTSD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Proof-of-concept, randomized, double-blind, crossover trial comparing ketamine with an active placebo control, midazolam, conducted at a single site (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York). Forty-one patients with chronic PTSD related to a range of trauma exposures were recruited via advertisements. INTERVENTIONS: Intravenous infusion of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) and midazolam (0.045 mg/kg). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was change in PTSD symptom severity, measured using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised. Secondary outcome measures included the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, the Clinical Global Impression-Severity and -Improvement scales, and adverse effect measures, including the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, and the Young Mania Rating Scale. RESULTS: Ketamine infusion was associated with significant and rapid reduction in PTSD symptom severity, compared with midazolam, when assessed 24 hours after infusion (mean difference in Impact of Event Scale-Revised score, 12.7 [95% CI, 2.5-22.8]; P = .02). Greater reduction of PTSD symptoms following treatment with ketamine was evident in both crossover and first-period analyses, and remained significant after adjusting for baseline and 24-hour depressive symptom severity. Ketamine was also associated with reduction in comorbid depressive symptoms and with improvement in overall clinical presentation. Ketamine was generally well tolerated without clinically significant persistent dissociative symptoms. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study provides the first evidence for rapid reduction in symptom severity following ketamine infusion in patients with chronic PTSD. If replicated, these findings may lead to novel approaches to the pharmacologic treatment of patients with this disabling condition.

612,"MDMA and metabolite disposition in expectorated oral fluid after controlled oral MDMA administration.^\nINTRODUCTION: The use of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is increasing, enhancing the need for its detection in clinical, workplace, pain management, and driving under the influence of drugs testing programs. Oral fluid is an important alternative matrix for drug testing, but little is known about MDMA detection windows in oral fluid. AIMS: The aim was to characterize MDMA and metabolite disposition in expectorated oral fluid after controlled MDMA administration. METHODS: Placebo, low (1.0 mg/kg), and high (1.6 mg/kg) oral MDMA doses were given double-blind in random order in separate sessions to 29 healthy adults with histories of MDMA use. One thousand two hundred eighty-six expectorated oral fluid specimens collected up to 7 days after dosing were analyzed for MDMA, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine (HMMA), and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine (HMA) by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The limits of quantification were 5 ng/mL for MDMA and MDA and 10 ng/mL for HMA and HMMA. RESULTS: MDMA was the primary analyte detected, with concentrations up to 12,000 ng/mL in 872 specimens (67.8%). MDA was quantified in 656 specimens (51.0%) at concentrations <403 ng/mL and was never present without concurrent MDMA. HMA and HMMA were not detected. Of the specimens, 59.8%, 58.6%, and 54.9% were found to be MDMA positive at the Talloires (20 ng/mL), Driving under the Influence of Drugs, Alcohol, and Medicines (25 ng/mL) and proposed US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (50 ng/mL) confirmation cutoffs, respectively. MDMA was first observed in oral fluid 0.25-1.25 hours after dosing; MDA was initially detected at 0.5-1.75 hours. In general, the windows of detection for MDMA and MDA were 47 and 29 hours, respectively, although a few specimens were positive up to 71 and 47 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Oral fluid monitoring efficiently detects single, recreational 70-150 mg of MDMA use for 1-2 days. These controlled administration data provide a scientific basis for interpreting MDMA oral fluid test results.",10,"[0.007488437928259373, 0.11915098875761032, 0.05044272541999817, 0.0028953547589480877, 0.0027748499996960163, 0.3568897247314453, 0.004216792527586222, 0.014289784245193005, 0.004544150549918413, 0.013675869442522526, 0.42363134026527405]",3
