1951,"Neurotoxic effects of ecstasy on the thalamus.^
Background Neurotoxic effects of ecstasy have been reported, although it remains unclear whether effects can be attributed to ecstasy, other recreational drugs or a combination of these. Aims To assess specific/independent neurotoxic effects of heavy ecstasy use and contributions of amphetamine, cocaine and cannabis as part of The Netherlands XTC Toxicity (NeXT) study. Method Effects of ecstasy and other substances were assessed with 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, diffusion tensor imaging, perfusion weighted imaging and [123I]2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl)-tropane ([ 123I]β-CIT) single photon emission computed tomography (serotonin transporters) in a sample (n=71) with broad variation in drug use, using multiple regression analyses. Results Ecstasy showed specific effects in the thalamus with decreased [123I]β-ClT binding, suggesting serotonergic axonal damage; decreased fractional anisotropy, suggesting axonal loss; and increased cerebral blood volume probably caused by serotonin depletion. Ecstasy had no effect on brain metabolites and apparent diffusion coefficients. Conclusions Converging evidence was found for a specific toxic effect of ecstasy on serotonergic axons in the thalamus.",1,"[0.0036491097416728735, 0.996350884437561]",1
4160,"Recreational 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA) or 'ecstasy' and self-focused compassion: Preliminary steps in the development of a therapeutic psychopharmacology of contemplative practices.^
3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA) produces diverse pro-social effects. Cognitive training methods rooted in Eastern contemplative practices also produce these effects through the development of a compassionate mindset. Given this similarity, we propose that one potential mechanism of action of MDMA in psychotherapy is through enhancing effects on intrapersonal attitudes (i.e. pro-social attitudes towards the self). We provide a preliminary test of this idea. Recreational MDMA (ecstasy) users were tested on two occasions, having consumed or not consumed ecstasy. Self-critical and self-compassionate responses to self-threatening scenarios were assessed before (T1) and after (T2) ecstasy use (or non-use), and then after compassionate imagery (T3). Moderating roles of dispositional self-criticism and avoidant attachment were examined. Separately, compassionate imagery and ecstasy produced similar sociotropic effects, as well as increases in self-compassion and reductions in self-criticism. Higher attachment-related avoidance was associated with additive effects of compassionate imagery and ecstasy on self-compassion. Findings were in line with MDMA's neuropharmacological profile, its phenomenological effects and its proposed adjunctive use in psychotherapy. However, although conditions were balanced, the experiment was non-blind and MDMA dose/purity was not determined. Controlled studies with pharmaceutically pure MDMA are still needed to test these effects rigorously.",1,"[0.0036516853142529726, 0.9963483214378357]",0

8157,"Exploring the therapeutic potential of Ayahuasca: acute intake increases mindfulness-related capacities.^
BACKGROUND: Ayahuasca is a psychotropic plant tea used for ritual purposes by the indigenous populations of the Amazon. In the last two decades, its use has expanded worldwide. The tea contains the psychedelic 5-HT2A receptor agonist N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), plus β-carboline alkaloids with monoamine-oxidase-inhibiting properties. Acute administration induces an introspective dream-like experience characterized by visions and autobiographic and emotional memories. Studies of long-term users have suggested its therapeutic potential, reporting that its use has helped individuals abandon the consumption of addictive drugs. Furthermore, recent open-label studies in patients with treatment-resistant depression found that a single ayahuasca dose induced a rapid antidepressant effect that was maintained weeks after administration. Here, we conducted an exploratory study of the psychological mechanisms that could underlie the beneficial effects of ayahuasca. METHODS: We assessed a group of 25 individuals before and 24 h after an ayahuasca session using two instruments designed to measure mindfulness capacities: The Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) and the Experiences Questionnaire (EQ). RESULTS: Ayahuasca intake led to significant increases in two facets of the FFMQ indicating a reduction in judgmental processing of experiences and in inner reactivity. It also led to a significant increase in decentering ability as measured by the EQ. These changes are classic goals of conventional mindfulness training, and the scores obtained are in the range of those observed after extensive mindfulness practice. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings support the claim that ayahuasca has therapeutic potential and suggest that this potential is due to an increase in mindfulness capacities.",1,"[0.004108912777155638, 0.9958910942077637]",1
4703,"Differences in substance abuse patterns: Multiple drug abuse alone versus schizophrenia with multiple drug abuse.^
Objective: To compare the lifetime consumption patterns of patients with schizophrenia and multiple substance abuse and multiple substance abusers without schizophrenia. Method: Two hundred and thirty in-patients of a specialized rehabilitation facility for young drug abusers were assessed with regard to their lifetime consumption patterns of 16 different classes of psychoactive drugs. While 110 patients had no diagnosis of a schizophrenic disorder, 120 patients had a comorbidity of multiple substance abuse and schizophrenia. Results: Comorbid patients reported a higher lifetime consumption of hallucinogens, whereas multiple substance abusers without schizophrenia showed a higher lifetime consumption rate of cocaine. Conclusion: The differences found in lifetime consumption patterns between comorbid patients and substance abusers without psychotic disorder do not support the so-called self-medication hypothesis. Instead, the differences in lifetime consumption of certain drugs might be a result of lower social competence and standing in schizophrenic patients and lower ability to procure certain illicit drugs.",0,"[0.980102002620697, 0.01989796943962574]",0
8269,"Development and validation of an LC-MS/MS method after chiral derivatization for the simultaneous stereoselective determination of methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) and its phase I and II metabolites in human blood plasma.^
3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) is a racemic drug of abuse and its two enantiomers are known to differ in their dose-response curves. The S-enantiomer was shown to be eliminated at a higher rate than the R-enantiomer. The most likely explanation for this is a stereoselective metabolism also claimed in in vitro studies. Urinary excretion studies showed that the main metabolites in humans are 4-hydroxy 3-methoxymethamphetamine (HMMA) 4-sulfate, HMMA 4-glucuronide and 3,4-dihydroxymethamphetamine (DHMA) 3-sulfate. For stereoselective pharmacokinetic analysis of phase I and phase II metabolites in human blood plasma useful analytical methods are needed. Therefore the aim of the presented study was the development and validation of a stereoselective liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous quantification of MDMA, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, DHMA, DHMA 3-sulfate, HMMA, HMMA 4-glucuronide, HMMA 4-sulfate, and 4-hydroxy 3-methoxyamphetamine in blood plasma for evaluation of the stereoselective pharmacokinetics in humans. Blood plasma samples were prepared by simple protein precipitation and afterwards all analytes were derivatized using N-(2,4-dinitro-5-fluorophenyl) L-valinamide resulting in the formation of diastereomers which were easily separable on standard reverse phase stationary phases. This simple and fast method was validated according to international guidelines including specificity, recovery, matrix effects, accuracy and precision, stabilities, and limits of quantification. The method proved to be selective, sensitive, accurate and precise for all tested analytes except for DHMA.",1,"[0.0035148283932358027, 0.9964851140975952]",1
7362,"Electrophysiological evidence of atypical processing underlying mental set shifting in ecstasy polydrug and polydrug users.^
Executive functioning deficits are reported in ecstasy users. However research into mental set switching has been equivocal, with behavioral studies suggesting the function is preserved. The current study sought to address the issue of switching deficits in ecstasy users by combining behavioral performance with electrophysiological correlates (electroencephalography; EEG). Twenty ecstasy polydrug users, 20 nonecstasy polydrug users, and 20 drug naive controls were recruited. Participants completed questionnaires about their drug use, sleep quality, fluid intelligence, and current mood state. Each participant completed a mental set switching task (the number-letter task) while EEG measures were recorded. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed no between-group differences on performance of the task; however a regression suggested that ecstasy use was a significant predictor for performance, after controlling for cannabis use. Mixed ANOVA revealed a significant effect of group on the P3, with significant differences between both drug groups and naives. There was also an interaction between electrode and group on the P2 component, with ecstasy users differing from both other groups. On the P3 component the results suggest a reduction in positivity at parieto-occipital electrodes for drug users compared to controls. Furthermore a significant increase in negativity in ecstasy users compared to control groups could be observed in several occipito-parietal electrodes at an N2 component as well as observable atypicalities in early processing (P2) displayed by ecstasy users and polydrug controls. The present study provides evidence of atypical processing of attentional shifting in ecstasy and polydrug users. Deficits in this executive function could reflect cognitive inflexibility and paucity of rapid behavioral adjustment, which may be problematic in real world situations.",1,"[0.0027692702133208513, 0.9972307085990906]",1
486,"Intraoperative ketamine for prevention of postoperative delirium or pain after major surgery in older adults: an international, multicentre, double-blind, randomised clinical trial.^
BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common and serious postoperative complication. Subanaesthetic ketamine is often administered intraoperatively for postoperative analgesia, and some evidence suggests that ketamine prevents delirium. The primary purpose of this trial was to assess the effectiveness of ketamine for prevention of postoperative delirium in older adults. METHODS: The Prevention of Delirium and Complications Associated with Surgical Treatments [PODCAST] study is a multicentre, international randomised trial that enrolled adults older than 60 years undergoing major cardiac and non-cardiac surgery under general anaesthesia. Using a computer-generated randomisation sequence we randomly assigned patients to one of three groups in blocks of 15 to receive placebo (normal saline), low-dose ketamine (0·5 mg/kg), or high dose ketamine (1·0 mg/kg) after induction of anaesthesia, before surgical incision. Participants, clinicians, and investigators were blinded to group assignment. Delirium was assessed twice daily in the first 3 postoperative days using the Confusion Assessment Method. We did analyses by intention-to-treat and assessed adverse events. This trial is registered with clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT01690988. FINDINGS: Between Feb 6, 2014, and June 26, 2016, 1360 patients were assessed, and 672 were randomly assigned, with 222 in the placebo group, 227 in the 0·5 mg/kg ketamine group, and 223 in the 1·0 mg/kg ketamine group. There was no difference in delirium incidence between patients in the combined ketamine groups and the placebo group (19·45% vs 19·82%, respectively; absolute difference 0·36%, 95% CI -6·07 to 7·38, p=0·92). There were more postoperative hallucinations (p=0·01) and nightmares (p=0·03) with increasing ketamine doses compared with placebo. Adverse events (cardiovascular, renal, infectious, gastrointestinal, and bleeding), whether viewed individually (p value for each >0·40) or collectively (36·9% in placebo, 39·6% in 0·5 mg/kg ketamine, and 40·8% in 1·0 mg/kg ketamine groups, p=0·69), did not differ significantly across groups. INTERPRETATION: A single subanaesthetic dose of ketamine did not decrease delirium in older adults after major surgery, and might cause harm by inducing negative experiences.

3943,"Classical psychedelics in psychiatry-renaissance of interest and therapeutic perspectives.^
Substances that change the states of consciousness have been used in the therapeutics of traditional cultures for hundreds of years. In the Western cultural circle, scientific curiosity and hope for a breakthrough in the treatment of various mental disorders constituted the basis of the first wave of research on humans with the use of psychedelics. After synthesizing LSD, psychedelic substances aroused intense but short-term interest among mental health specialists at the beginning of the second half of the 20th century. In the preliminary studies, substances such as psilocybin or LSD, used as a supplement to psychotherapy, showed promising therapeutic effects, however, due to legal and political reasons, all research work was stopped in the 1970s. The last two decades have been a period of renaissance in the interest in using psychedelic substances in psychiatry. Despite the early stage of work, the clinical research conducted so far has indicated the potential benefits of using psychedelics in the treatment of anxiety, affective disorders, or addictions. Moreover, so far, no serious side effects of this form of therapy have been reported. However, due to a number of barriers of both medical and legal nature, the creation of the first psychiatric drug with psychedelic properties appears to be extremely complicated. Further, precisely constructed studies on large groups of patients are needed to determine whether psychedelics can find practical applications in psychiatric therapy (or even become a long-awaited breakthrough in the treatment of mental disorders).",0,"[0.9930450320243835, 0.006954954005777836]",0

8330,"A university system drug profile.^
This study was undertaken to determine current patterns of drug usage and related behavior of college, university, and junior college students in the University System of Georgia. A maximum saturation survey technique, utilizing a 112 item questionnaire as the primary research tool, resulted in a usable sample of 24,609 student respondents. The focus of attention was on student usage patterns of tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, LSD, glue, narcotics, stimulants, hallucinogens and depressants. An attempt is made to determine patterns of drug use (estimates of current use, history of use, and plans for future use); attitudes, beliefs, and drug use (attitudes toward drug use, and legal controls, and informed sources about drugs); and demographic variables and drug use (sex, age, religion, marital status, spending money, race, parental drug use and attitudes, student living group, and class standing). If one were inclined to construct a profile of a typical university system drug user from the relative frequencies of drug use reported in this paper, it would appear as follows. The student would be a Caucasian, senior male, 21 years of age or older, divorced, Jewish, residing in a commune or on-campus married housing/Greek housing, with access to more spending money than his average peer. The value of the University System of Georgia drug study lies in the representativeness and size of the sample, number of items in the questionnaire, and the resulting base-line data which enables the system to know the level of usage among its current student population.

3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""Ecstasy"") releases serotonin and dopamine. The role for dopamine in mediating the effects of MDMA has not yet been examined in humans. We investigated the effect of pretreatment with the dopamine D(2) antagonist haloperidol (1.4 mg i.v.) on psychological and physiological responses to MDMA (1.5 mg/kg p.o.) in 14 healthy volunteers using a double-blind placebo-controlled within-subject design. Subjective peak effects were rated using standardised scales. The physiological effects measured were blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature. Side effects were assessed during the session, and after 1 and 3 days. Haloperidol attenuated MDMA-induced positive and mania-like mood but had no reducing effect on other subjective changes or on cardiovascular effects. Results are consistent with a partial dopaminergic mediation of the euphoriant effects of MDMA. In contrast, dopamine does not seem to contribute to the physiological effects of MDMA, indicating a role for serotonin and norepinephrine.",1,"[0.002822000766173005, 0.9971779584884644]",1

3189,"Psilocybin treatment for anxiety in patients with advanced-stage cancer.^
Background: From the late 1950s to the early 1970s clinical research was conducted exploring the use of hallucinogens to treat the existential anxiety, despair and isolation often associated with advanced‐stage cancer. These reports described critically ill individuals undergoing psycho spiritual epiphanies, frequently with sustained improvement in anxiety, mood and quality of life. While these promising investigations were halted because of political and cultural pressures, after a thirty year hiatus the development of hallucinogen treatment research for patients with anxiety reactive to advanced‐stage cancer has resumed. Methods: This presentation examines the rationale, methodology and results of a pilot investigation using psilocybin to treat the existential anxiety associated with advanced‐stage cancer. Psilocybin, the active alkaloid in hallucinogenic mushrooms and a 5‐HT2A and 5‐HT2C agonist, was administered to 12 screened subjects diagnosed with advanced‐stage cancer and anxiety. A double‐blind, placebo‐controlled methodology was employed, utilizing a moderate dosage of psilocybin, 0.2 mg/kg. Treatment sessions were conducted on the Clinical Research Unit at Harbor‐UCLA Medical Center. Results: Safe physiological and psychological responses were documented during treatment sessions. There were no clinically significant adverse events with psilocybin. The State‐Trait Anxiety Inventory trait anxiety subscale demonstrated a significant reduction in anxiety at 1 and 3 months after treatment. The Beck Depression Inventory revealed an improvement of mood that reached significance at 6 months; the Profile of Mood States identified mood improvement after treatment with psilocybin that approached but did not reach significance. Conclusions: This study establishes the feasibility and safety of administering moderate doses of psilocybin to patients with advanced‐stage cancer and anxiety. Some of the data revealed a positive trend toward improved mood and anxiety. These results support the need for more research in this long‐neglected field. To that end, two new studies using psilocybin to treat cancer anxiety, at Johns Hopkins and New York University, are currently on‐going. Both of these investigations are evaluating higher doses than used in the Harbor‐UCLA study, allowing for greater exploration of the role of psycho‐spiritual or transcendent states of consciousness in facilitating therapeutic outcomes.",1,"[0.0028289949987083673, 0.9971709847450256]",1

Studies of the chronic effects of MDMA, or 'ecstasy', in humans have been largely inconsistent. We explored whether study-level characteristics are associated with the effect size estimate reported. We based our analyses on the recent systematic review by Rogers and colleagues, focusing on those meta-analyses within this report where there was a relatively large number of studies contributing to each individual meta-analysis. Linear regression was used to investigate the association between study level variables and effect size estimate, weighted by the inverse of the SE of the effect size estimate, with cluster correction for studies which contributed multiple estimates. This indicated an association between effect size estimate and both user group, with smaller estimates among studies recruiting former users compared with those recruiting current users, and control group, with smaller estimates among studies recruiting polydrug user controls compared with those recruiting drug-naïve controls. In addition, increasing year of publication was associated with reduced effect size estimate, and there was a trend level association with prevalence of ecstasy use, reflecting smaller estimates among studies conducted in countries with higher prevalence of ecstasy use. Our data suggest a number of study-level characteristics which appear to influence individual study effect size estimates.

6707,"Is ecstasy MDMA? A review of the proportion of ecstasy tablets containing MDMA, their dosage levels, and the changing perceptions of purity.^
AIMS: Not every tablet sold as ""ecstasy"" contains MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine). The historical origins and evolution of this mismatch will be reviewed, in order to estimate the proportions of ecstasy tablets containing MDMA at different periods over the past 30 years. METHODS: Surveys into the pharmacological constituents of ecstasy tablets, dosage levels, and empirical reports of their perceived purity, provide the main data for this review. RESULTS: During the 1980s and early 1990s there were few problems with the purity of ecstasy tablets, and the biochemical evidence shows that they nearly always contained MDMA. During the mid-1990s, the majority of ecstasy tablets continued to contain MDMA, while many others comprised MDA (3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine), MDEA (3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine), or amphetamine drug mixtures. However, a small proportion (4-20% according to survey, time and place), comprised non-amphetamine drugs such as caffeine, ephedrine, ketamine, paracetamol, or placebo. During the late 1990s, the proportion of ecstasy tablets containing MDMA increased to around 80-90%. The latest reports suggest that non-MDMA tablets are now very infrequent, with purity levels between 90% and 100%. Dosage levels of tablets are also highly variable, with low dose tablet often encountered during the mid-1990s, and high dose tablets now seen more frequently. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings will be debated. CONCLUSIONS: The ecstasy purity problem was predominantly a phenomenon of the mid to late 1990s, when many tablets contained substances other than MDMA. Before and since then, the proportion of ecstasy tablets containing MDMA has been very high.",0,"[0.9726291298866272, 0.027370896190404892]",1
9261,"Microdosing with classical psychedelics: Research trajectories and practical considerations.^
Microdosing-the intermittent ingestion of minute, sub-hallucinogenic amounts of psychedelic substances, repeatedly and over time-has become a widespread, albeit largely understudied, phenomenon. Regulations around using psychedelics at any dose-micro, mini, macro, or mega-pose all sorts of difficulties for those who wish to systematically study the effects of Schedule I drugs, especially in the United States. Microdosers commonly claim that taking a sub-hallucinogenic (pre-hallucinogenic or sub-perceptual) dose improves higher brain functions, including creativity, productivity, and mood. If true, these results would provide an important experimental edge in distinguishing psychosocial effects (e.g. caused by expectation) from those related to the active psychedelic ingredient. In this critical integrative synthesis, we explore the psychobiological science of dose amounts and how it informs microdosing with classical psychedelics (e.g. lysergic acid diethylamide [LSD] and psilocybin) to highlight and fuel research into questions (e.g. in cognitive neuroscience, consciousness studies, and metacognition).

2608,"Drug, sex and age differentials in the use of Australian publicly funded treatment services.^
Context: Little is known about the proportion of the Australian population using alcohol or other drugs who may seek treatment. There is a need to have some additional estimates of population morbidity which reflect harms associated with use. Objective: To determine Australian population rates of publicly funded community based specialised alcohol and other drug treatment and in-patient hospital care by those 'at risk', by drug type, sex and age. Design and setting: The design is secondary data analysis of publicly available datasets. We use the latest available complete data on Australian general population incidence of alcohol, cannabis amphetamines and ecstasy use (2007 National Drug Strategy House hold Survey) and nationally collected administrative data on publicly funded specialised alcohol and other drug treatment services (2006-2007 Alcohol and Other Drug Treatment Services National Minimum Dataset) and public hospitals (2006-2007 National Hospital Morbidity Minimum Dataset) to calculate rates of drug treatment and in-patient hospital care per 1000 Australians. 'At risk' for alcohol is defined as being at risk of short term harm, as defined by the National Health and Medical Research Council (2001). 'At risk' for illicit drugs is defined as those exposed to potential harm through at least weekly use of cannabis, amphetamines and ecstasy use. Results: Risky alcohol consumption followed by recent cannabis use appears to lead to most harm. Greater harm seems to be experienced by males rather than females. Younger adults (15-19 years) and older adults (40+ years) seem also to experience the highest rates of harm. Conclusions: It is possible to derive population estimates of harms associated with licit and illicit drugs use. Treatment rates vary across drug type, gender and age. Alcohol and cannabis are the substances whose use leads to the greatest demand for services. Ecstasy appears to generate few presentations for treatment. Publicly available data can be used to estimate harms associated with the use of particular substances. Such estimates are best interpreted in the light of other ways of estimating harms. © the author(s), publisher and licensee Libertas Academica Ltd.",0,"[0.9755824208259583, 0.024417616426944733]",0
6006,"Psychopharmacology of Psilocybin in Cancer Patients.^
This research is being done to study the psychological effects of psilocybin in cancer patients. Psilocybin is a naturally occurring substance found in some mushrooms that some cultures have used for centuries in religious practices. Psilocybin has not been approved for general medical use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Its use in this study is investigational. Psilocybin is a mood‐altering drug with effects similar to other hallucinogens like LSD and mescaline. Mescaline is the main psychoactive component of the peyote cactus used in Native American religious practices. Such substances have been used for centuries in some cultures as a way of inducing non‐ordinary states of consciousness for religious and spiritual purposes. An earlier study that was done in our lab with healthy participants found that psilocybin, given in a comfortable and supportive setting, can provide an experience that is personally and spiritually meaningful for the participant. This study is being done to find out if psilocybin can also produce personally and spiritually meaningful experiences in cancer patients. This could be important because spirituality has been associated with increased psychological coping and decreased depression in serious illness. People with a diagnosis of cancer between the ages of 21 and 80 years old and who meet the medical requirements may join. About 44 people are expected to take part in this study.",1,"[0.02102530002593994, 0.9789746999740601]",1
5688,"MDMA-assisted therapy for severe PTSD: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study.^
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) presents a major public health problem for which currently available treatments are modestly effective. We report the findings of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-site phase 3 clinical trial (NCT03537014) to test the efficacy and safety of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted therapy for the treatment of patients with severe PTSD, including those with common comorbidities such as dissociation, depression, a history of alcohol and substance use disorders, and childhood trauma. After psychiatric medication washout, participants (n = 90) were randomized 1:1 to receive manualized therapy with MDMA or with placebo, combined with three preparatory and nine integrative therapy sessions. PTSD symptoms, measured with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5, the primary endpoint), and functional impairment, measured with the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS, the secondary endpoint) were assessed at baseline and at 2 months after the last experimental session. Adverse events and suicidality were tracked throughout the study. MDMA was found to induce significant and robust attenuation in CAPS-5 score compared with placebo (P < 0.0001, d = 0.91) and to significantly decrease the SDS total score (P = 0.0116, d = 0.43). The mean change in CAPS-5 scores in participants completing treatment was -24.4 (s.d. 11.6) in the MDMA group and -13.9 (s.d. 11.5) in the placebo group. MDMA did not induce adverse events of abuse potential, suicidality or QT prolongation. These data indicate that, compared with manualized therapy with inactive placebo, MDMA-assisted therapy is highly efficacious in individuals with severe PTSD, and treatment is safe and well-tolerated, even in those with comorbidities. We conclude that MDMA-assisted therapy represents a potential breakthrough treatment that merits expedited clinical evaluation.",1,"[0.0034281474072486162, 0.9965718984603882]",1
593,"Effects of psilocybin versus escitalopram on rumination and thought suppression in depression.^
BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder is often associated with maladaptive coping strategies, including rumination and thought suppression. AIMS: To assess the comparative effect of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor escitalopram, and the serotonergic psychedelic psilocybin (COMP360), on rumination and thought suppression in major depressive disorder. METHOD: Based on data derived from a randomised clinical trial (N = 59), we performed exploratory analyses on the impact of escitalopram versus psilocybin (i.e. condition) on rumination and thought suppression from 1 week before to 6 weeks after treatment inception (i.e. time), using mixed analysis of variance. Condition responder versus non-responder subgroup analyses were also done, using the standard definition of ≥50% symptom reduction. RESULTS: A time×condition interaction was found for rumination (F(1, 56) = 4.58, P = 0.037) and thought suppression (F(1,57) = 5.88, P = 0.019), with post hoc tests revealing significant decreases exclusively in the psilocybin condition. When analysing via response, a significant time×condition×response interaction for thought suppression (F(1,54) = 8.42, P = 0.005) and a significant time×response interaction for rumination (F(1,54) = 23.50, P < 0.001) were evident. Follow-up tests revealed that decreased thought suppression was exclusive to psilocybin responders, whereas rumination decreased in both responder groups. In the psilocybin arm, decreases in rumination and thought suppression correlated with ego dissolution and session-linked psychological insight. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide further evidence on the therapeutic mechanisms of psilocybin and escitalopram in the treatment of depression.",1,"[0.0030961905140429735, 0.9969038367271423]",1

1548,"Animal models of schizophrenia: The case for LSD-25.^
Some of the difficulties of trying to establish an animal model of schizophrenia are first considered. Then, after a review of the evidence on the experimental psychopathology of schizophrenia, particularly that concerned with attention and arousal, it is concluded that the core feature which needs to be modeled in animals is some aspect of 'input dysfunction'. It is argued that, of the pharmacological strategies, LSD-25 comes nearest to meeting that requirement, for 2 reasons. First, the phenomenology of an LSD 'model psychosis' closely parallels that of the natural disease. Secondly, the experimental effects of the drug, both in animals and man, are very similar to or can be closely aligned theoretically with those of schizophrenia. An example is quoted from work in the author's laboratory where LSD was found to produce psychophysiological effects virtually identical to those observed occurring naturally in acute psychotic patients and in normal subjects high in 'psychotic' personality traits. It is suggested that the rejection of LSD as a drug model was premature, especially as the currently popular preference for amphetamine has not been vindicated, either by the latter's ability to mimic an important central feature of the psychotic state or by work on dopamine as a specific common mediator of amphetamine psychosis and of schizophrenia.",0,"[0.9917364716529846, 0.008263477124273777]",0
3625,"Imaging the effect of ketamine on synaptic density (SV2A) in the living brain.^
The discovery of ketamine as a rapid and robust antidepressant marks the beginning of a new era in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Ketamine is thought to produce rapid and sustained antidepressant effects through restoration of lost synaptic connections. We investigated this hypothesis in humans for the first time using positron emission tomography (PET) and [11C]UCB-J—a radioligand that binds to the synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) and provides an index of axon terminal density. Overall, we did not find evidence of a measurable effect on SV2A density 24 h after a single administration of ketamine in non-human primates, healthy controls (HCs), or individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) and/or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), despite a robust reduction in symptoms. A post-hoc, exploratory analysis suggests that patients with lower SV2A density at baseline may exhibit increased SV2A density 24 h after ketamine. This increase in SV2A was associated with a reduction in depression severity, as well as an increase in dissociative symptoms. These initial findings suggest that a restoration of synaptic connections in patients with lower SV2A at baseline may underlie ketamine’s therapeutic effects, however, this needs replication in a larger sample. Further work is needed to build on these initial findings and further establish the nuanced pre- and post-synaptic mechanisms underpinning ketamine’s therapeutic effects.",1,"[0.08603812009096146, 0.9139618873596191]",0
7027,"Structure-Activity Assessment and In-Depth Analysis of Biased Agonism in a Set of Phenylalkylamine 5-HT2A Receptor Agonists.^
Serotonergic psychedelics are described to have activation of the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2A) as their main pharmacological action. Despite their relevance, the molecular mechanisms underlying the psychedelic effects induced by certain 5-HT2A agonists remain elusive. One of the proposed hypotheses is the occurrence of biased agonism, defined as the preferential activation of certain signaling pathways over others. This study comparatively monitored the efficiency of a diverse panel of 4-position-substituted (and N-benzyl-derived) phenylalkylamines to induce recruitment of β-arrestin2 (βarr2) or miniGαq to the 5-HT2A, allowing us to assess structure-activity relationships and biased agonism. All test compounds exhibited agonist properties with a relatively large range of both EC50 and Emax values. Interestingly, the lipophilicity of the 2C-X phenethylamines was correlated with their efficacy in both assays but yielded a stronger correlation in the miniGαq- than in the βarr2-assay. Molecular docking suggested that accommodation of the 4-substituent of the 2C-X analogues in a hydrophobic pocket between transmembrane helices 4 and 5 of 5-HT2A may contribute to this differential effect. Aside from previously used standard conditions (lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) as a reference agonist and a 2 h activation profile to assess a compound’s activity), serotonin was included as a second reference agonist, and the compounds’ activities were also assessed using the first 30 min of the activation profile. Under all assessed circumstances, the qualitative structure-activity relationships remained unchanged. Furthermore, the use of two reference agonists allowed for the estimation of both “benchmark bias” (relative to LSD) and “physiology bias” (relative to serotonin).",0,"[0.9898629188537598, 0.010137050412595272]",0
4177,"Effect of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) on reinforcement learning in humans.^
BACKGROUND: The non-selective serotonin 2A (5-HT(2A)) receptor agonist lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) holds promise as a treatment for some psychiatric disorders. Psychedelic drugs such as LSD have been suggested to have therapeutic actions through their effects on learning. The behavioural effects of LSD in humans, however, remain incompletely understood. Here we examined how LSD affects probabilistic reversal learning (PRL) in healthy humans. METHODS: Healthy volunteers received intravenous LSD (75 μg in 10 mL saline) or placebo (10 mL saline) in a within-subjects design and completed a PRL task. Participants had to learn through trial and error which of three stimuli was rewarded most of the time, and these contingencies switched in a reversal phase. Computational models of reinforcement learning (RL) were fitted to the behavioural data to assess how LSD affected the updating ('learning rates') and deployment of value representations ('reinforcement sensitivity') during choice, as well as 'stimulus stickiness' (choice repetition irrespective of reinforcement history). RESULTS: Raw data measures assessing sensitivity to immediate feedback ('win-stay' and 'lose-shift' probabilities) were unaffected, whereas LSD increased the impact of the strength of initial learning on perseveration. Computational modelling revealed that the most pronounced effect of LSD was the enhancement of the reward learning rate. The punishment learning rate was also elevated. Stimulus stickiness was decreased by LSD, reflecting heightened exploration. Reinforcement sensitivity differed by phase. CONCLUSIONS: Increased RL rates suggest LSD induced a state of heightened plasticity. These results indicate a potential mechanism through which revision of maladaptive associations could occur in the clinical application of LSD.",1,"[0.0024978872388601303, 0.9975021481513977]",1

The effects of stimulant drugs on risk-taking behavior vary across individuals, even in healthy samples. These differences could relate to personality, which may share common mechanisms with drug effects or impulsive, risk-taking behavior.

Forty healthy men and women, aged 18 to 35, completed the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART; Lejuez et al., 2002) with three reward values after ingesting placebo or d-amphetamine (10, 20 mg). They completed the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire Brief Form (MPQ-BF; Patrick et al., 2002), with three main scales: Trait reward sensitivity (Agentic Positive Emotionality; AgPEM), impulsivity (Constraint; CON), and negative affect (Negative Emotionality; NEM). d-Amphetamine (20 mg) decreased risk behavior in low AgPEM males, but increased risk behavior in high AgPEM males, producing positive correlations with AgPEM in men (r >= +.55, p <.05). The drug did not affect risk-taking in women. There was evidence of discriminant validity between the AgPEM, NEM, and CON dimensions and behavioral responses to amphetamine.

Objective To systematically review published research studies and ongoing clinical trials investigating nitrous oxide (N2O) in psychiatric disorders, providing an up-to-date snapshot of the clinical research landscape. Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted for studies published until June 2021 using the OVID databases (MEDLINE, Embase, APA PsycInfo) and the clinical trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP). Results In total, five relevant published articles were identified, among which four investigated N2O for depression. One single-dose randomized controlled trial (RCT) for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), one triple crossover RCT comparing 50% vs. 25% N2O for TRD, and one repeated-dose RCT for major depressive disorder (MDD) suggest that N2O has preliminary feasibility with rapid-acting effects on symptoms of depression. From the public registries, 10 relevant ongoing clinical trials were identified. They aim to explore the use of N2O for MDD, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and suicidal ideation. To date, the typical treatment protocol parameters were a single session of 50% N2O delivered for 60 min, although the concentration of 25% is also being explored. Projected enrolment numbers for ongoing trials (M = 55.0) were much higher than sample sizes for published studies (M = 13.0), suggesting that there potentially will be more large-scale RCTs published in the next few years.

BACKGROUND: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is prevalent in military personnel and first responders, many of whom do not respond to currently available treatments. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy for treating chronic PTSD in this population. METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, dose-response, phase 2 trial at an outpatient psychiatric clinic in the USA. We included service personnel who were 18 years or older, with chronic PTSD duration of 6 months or more, and who had a Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-IV) total score of 50 or greater. Using a web-based randomisation system, we randomly assigned participants (1:1:2) to three different dose groups of MDMA plus psychotherapy: 30 mg (active control), 75 mg, or 125 mg. We masked investigators, independent outcome raters, and participants until after the primary endpoint. MDMA was administered orally in two 8-h sessions with concomitant manualised psychotherapy. The primary outcome was mean change in CAPS-IV total score from baseline to 1 month after the second experimental session. Participants in the 30 mg and 75 mg groups subsequently underwent three 100-125 mg MDMA-assisted psychotherapy sessions in an open-label crossover, and all participants were assessed 12 months after the last MDMA session. Safety was monitored through adverse events, spontaneously reported expected reactions, vital signs, and suicidal ideation and behaviour. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01211405. FINDINGS: Between Nov 10, 2010, and Jan 29, 2015, 26 veterans and first responders met eligibility criteria and were randomly assigned to receive 30 mg (n=7), 75 mg (n=7), or 125 mg (n=12) of MDMA plus psychotherapy. At the primary endpoint, the 75 mg and 125 mg groups had significantly greater decreases in PTSD symptom severity (mean change CAPS-IV total scores of -58·3 [SD 9·8] and -44·3 [28·7]; p=0·001) than the 30 mg group (-11·4 [12·7]). Compared with the 30 mg group, Cohen's d effect sizes were large: 2·8 (95% CI 1·19-4·39) for the 75 mg group and 1·1 (0·04-2·08) for the 125 mg group. In the open-label crossover with full-dose MDMA (100-125 mg), PTSD symptom severity significantly decreased in the group that had previously received 30 mg (p=0·01), whereas no further significant decreases were observed in the group that previously achieved a large response after 75 mg doses in the blinded segment (p=0·81). PTSD symptoms were significantly reduced at the 12-month follow-up compared with baseline after all groups had full-dose MDMA (mean CAPS-IV total score of 38·8 [SD 28·1] vs 87·1 [16·1]; p<0·0001). 85 adverse events were reported by 20 participants. Of these adverse events, four (5%) were serious: three were deemed unrelated and one possibly related to study drug treatment.

6394,"Palliative care provider attitudes toward existential distress and treatment with psychedelic-assisted therapies.^
BACKGROUND: Existential distress is a significant source of suffering for patients facing life-threatening illness. Psychedelic-Assisted Therapies (PAT) are novel treatments that have shown promise in treating existential distress, but openness to providing PAT may be limited by stigma surrounding psychedelics and the paucity of education regarding their medical use. How PAT might be integrated into existing treatments for existential distress within palliative care remains underexplored. METHODS: The present study aimed to elucidate the attitudes of palliative care clinicians regarding treatments for existential distress, including PAT. We recruited palliative care physicians, advanced practice nurses, and spiritual and psychological care providers from multiple US sites using purposive and snowball sampling methods. Attitudes toward PAT were unknown prior to study involvement. Semi-structured interviews targeted at current approaches to existential distress and attitudes toward PAT were analyzed for thematic content. RESULTS: Nineteen respondents (seven physicians, four advanced practice nurses, four chaplains, three social workers, and one psychologist) were interviewed. Identified themes were 1) Existential distress is a common experience that is frequently insufficiently treated within the current treatment framework; 2) Palliative care providers ultimately see existential distress as a psychosocial-spiritual problem that evades medicalized approaches; 3) Palliative care providers believe PAT hold promise for treating existential distress but that a stronger evidence base is needed; 4) Because PAT do not currently fit existing models of existential distress treatment, barriers remain. CONCLUSIONS: PAT is seen as a potentially powerful tool to treat refractory existential distress. Larger clinical trials and educational outreach are needed to clarify treatment targets and address safety concerns. Further work to adapt PAT to palliative care settings should emphasize collaboration with spiritual care as well as mental health providers and seek to address unresolved concerns about equitable access.",0,"[0.9811728596687317, 0.018827103078365326]",1

BACKGROUND: Surgery induces high rates of cognitive disorders, persisting for up to 12 months in elderly adults. This review aimed to assess the currently debated preventive effect of perioperative ketamine on postoperative delirium and postoperative neurocognitive disorders (POND). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis including all randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of perioperative ketamine administration in adult patients compared to placebo or no intervention on postoperative delirium and/or POND between January 2007 and April 2022. Database searches were conducted in PubMed, Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Central. Random effects models were used to pool overall estimates. The GRADE approach was used to assess the quality of the evidence. RESULTS: From 1379 records screened, 14 randomized controlled trials with 1618 patients randomized met our inclusion criteria with a high level of consensus among reviewers, amongst whom 50% were at low-moderate risk of bias. There was no between-group difference in postoperative delirium [8 trials, 1265 patients, odds ratio (OR) 0.93, 95% CI (0.51-1.70), I2 =28%] and POND [5 trials, 494 patients, OR 0.52, 95% CI (0.15-1.80); I2 =78%]. There was no significant between-group difference in postoperative psychological adverse effects, level of pain, hospital length of stay, or mortality. Between-group subgroup analyses showed no difference in delirium or POND incidence according to surgical setting, ketamine dose, mode of administration, combination or not with other drug(s), and assessment timing or definition of cognitive disorders. CONCLUSION: Perioperative ketamine does not prevent postoperative delirium or POND. Significant study heterogeneity suggests that standardized measures for POND assessment and a specific focus on patients at high risk for POND should be used to improve the comparability of future studies.",1,"[0.02603844366967678, 0.9739615321159363]",1

7833,"USE OF VIRTUAL REALITY IN FACILITATING MOVEMENT THROUGH PHASES OF PSYCHEDELICASSISTED PSYCHOTHERAPY.^
Background: Psychedelic research shows promising outcomes, while highlighting limitations and challenges previously uncommon in psychiatry. Transition into and out of an altered state of consciousness requires support and guidance that may not be met with traditional methods. In contrast, the ineffable world of virtual reality (VR) effortlessly inspires the sense of surrender, mindful self‐exploration and supports consolidation of peak experiences. Objectives: To best use contextual design to support psychedelic treatment. VR's unique ability to take the patient out of the laboratory environment and carefully control exposure to stimuli is examined in its capacity to catalyse the process of healing and mitigate potential adverse effects. Method: Bespoke VR scenarios were designed to target unique needs that emerge as a result of an altered state of consciousness. A novel protocol maps out methods of injecting VR experiences into psychedelic treatment across preparation, dosing and integration sessions. The protocol and VR designs are explored with a randomised, controlled trial conducted by Enosis Therapeutics and Centre for Human Psychopharmacology at Swinburne University of Technology. Expected findings: VR models are expected to increase mindful, relaxed engagement throughout the entire treatment. It is also anticipated that immersion in VR scenarios will deepen mystical experiences, which are known for their beneficial effects. Finally, VR is expected to increase the comfort of patient‐therapist exchange and promote consolidation of self‐generated memories during the integration process. Conclusion: While research into VR and psychedelics shows efficacy of those treatments independently, a synergistic approach may have unprecedented benefits for patient experiences of an altered state of consciousness and of psychedelic‐psychotherapy at large.",0,"[0.9834242463111877, 0.016575735062360764]",0
7278,"Reduced N-acetylaspartate levels in the frontal cortex of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy) users: Preliminary results.^
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The perceived safety of the recreational drug methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), or Ecstasy, conflicts with animal evidence indicating that MDMA damages cortical serotonin (5-HT) neurons at doses similar to those used by humans. Few data are available about the effects of MDMA on the human brain. This study was designed to evaluate MDMA-related alterations in metabolite ratios with single-voxel proton (1H) MR spectroscopy. METHODS: Fifteen male MDMA users (mean lifetime exposure, 723 tablets; mean time since last tablet, 12.0 weeks) and 12 age-matched control subjects underwent single-voxel 1H MR spectroscopy. N-Acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr), NAA/Choline (Cho), and myoinositol (MI)/Cr ratios were measured in midfrontal gray matter, midoccipital gray matter, and right parietal white matter. Data were analyzed with linear model-based multivariate analysis of variance. RESULTS: NAA/Cr (P = .04) and NAA/Cho (P = .03) ratios, markers associated with neuronal loss or dysfunction, were reduced in the frontal cortex of MDMA users. Neither NAA/Cr (P = .72) nor NAA/Cho (P = .12) ratios were different between both groups in occipital gray matter and parietal white matter (P = .18). Extent of previous MDMA use and frontal cortical NAA/Cr (ρ = -.50, P = .012) or NAA/Cho (ρ = -.550, P < .01) ratios were significantly associated. CONCLUSION: Reduced NAA/Cr and NAA/Cho ratios at 1H MR spectroscopy provide evidence for neuronal abnormality in the frontal cortex of MDMA users; these are correlated with the degree of MDMA exposure. These data suggest that MDMA may be a neurotoxin in humans, as it is in animals.",1,"[0.002432270674034953, 0.9975677132606506]",1
2518,"Ketamine metabolites with antidepressant effects: Fast, economical, and eco-friendly enantioselective separation based on supercritical-fluid chromatography (SFC) and single quadrupole MS detection.^
Increasing evidence accumulates that metabolites of the dissociative anesthetic ketamine contribute considerably to the biological effects of this drug and could be developed as next generation antidepressants, especially for acute treatment of patients with therapy-refractory major depression. Analytical methods for the simultaneous determination of the plethora of hydroxylated, dehydrogenated and/or demethylated compounds formed after administration of ketamine hydrochloride are a prerequisite for future clinical investigations and a deeper understanding of the individual role of the isomers of these metabolites. In this study, we present development and validation of a method based on supercritical-fluid chromatography (SFC) coupled to single quadrupole MS detection that allows the separation of ketamine as well as all of its relevant metabolites detected in urine of healthy volunteers. Inherently to SFC methods, the run times of the novel protocol are four times shorter than in a comparable HPLC method, the use of organic solvents is reduced and we were able to demonstrate and validate the successful enantioselective separation and quantification of R- and S-ketamine, R- and S-norketamine, R- and S-dehydronorketamine and (2R,6R)- and (2S,6S)-hydroxynorketamine isomers differing in either constitution, stereochemistry, or both, in one run.

360,"Twenty percent better with 20 micrograms? A qualitative study of psychedelic microdosing self-rapports and discussions on YouTube.^
BACKGROUND: Psychedelic microdosing is the trending practice of using tiny repeated doses of psychedelic substances to facilitate a range of supposed benefits. With only a few published studies to date, the subject is still under-researched, and more knowledge is warranted. Social media and internet discussion forums have played a vital role in the growing visibility of the microdosing phenomenon, and the present study utilized YouTube contents to improve comprehension of the microdosing practice as well as the social interactions and discussions around microdosing. METHODS: Microdosing self-disclosure in YouTube videos and their following comments were qualitatively analyzed by inductive thematic analysis. Various software was utilized to enable gathering and sorting relevant data. RESULTS: Microdosing of psychedelic substances, primarily LSD and psilocybin, was used for therapeutic and enhancement purposes, and predominantly beneficial effects were reported. Many different applications and outcomes were discussed, and therapeutic effects for depression appeared especially noteworthy. Intentions for use were recognized as an influencing factor for the progression and outcomes of microdosing. The function of social interactions was mainly to discuss views on the microdosing phenomenon, strategies for optimal results, minimize risks, and share emotional support. CONCLUSIONS: Potentially, microdosing could provide some of the same benefits (for certain conditions) as full-dose interventions with less risk of adverse reactions related to the sometimes intense experiences of higher doses. Microdosing may well also mean additional benefits, as well as risks, through the repeated exposure over extended periods.",1,"[0.07811463624238968, 0.9218853116035461]",0
4330,"The Role of Glutamate Underlying Treatment-resistant Depression.^
The monoamine hypothesis has significantly improved our understanding of mood disorders and their treatment by linking monoaminergic abnormalities to the pathophysiology of mood disorders. Even 50 years after the monoamine hypothesis was established, some patients do not respond to treatments for depression, including selective serotonin reuptake drugs. Accumulating evidence shows that patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) have severe abnormalities in the neuroplasticity and neurotrophic factor pathways, indicating that different treatment approaches may be necessary. Therefore, the glutamate hypothesis is gaining attention as a novel hypothesis that can overcome monoamine restrictions. Glutamate has been linked to structural and maladaptive morphological alterations in several brain areas associated with mood disorders. Recently, ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, has shown efficacy in TRD treatment and has received the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, revitalizing psychiatry research. However, the mechanism by which ketamine improves TRD remains unclear. In this review, we re-examined the glutamate hypothesis, bringing the glutamate system onboard to join the modulation of the monoamine systems, emphasizing the most prominent ketamine antidepressant mechanisms, such as NMDAR inhibition and NMDAR disinhibition in GABAergic interneurons. Furthermore, we discuss the animal models used in preclinical studies and the sex differences in the effects of ketamine.",0,"[0.9909101128578186, 0.009089911356568336]",0
5136,"Ketamine Alters Electrophysiological Responses to Emotional Faces in Major Depressive Disorder.^
BACKGROUND: The glutamatergic modulator ketamine rapidly reduces depressive symptoms in individuals with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD). However, ketamine's effects on emotional processing biases remain largely unknown, and understanding these processes may help elucidate ketamine's mechanism of action. METHODS: Magnetoencephalography (MEG) was used to investigate ketamine's effects on early visual responses to affective stimuli in individuals with MDD (n=31) and healthy volunteers (HVs; n=24). Participants were enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial and were assessed at baseline and after subanesthetic-dose ketamine and placebo-saline infusions. During MEG recording, participants completed an emotional evaluation task in which they indicated the sex or emotional valence (happy-neutral or sad-angry) of facial stimuli. Source-localized event-related field (ERF) M100 and M170 amplitudes and latencies were extracted from regions of interest. Linear fixed effects models examined interactions between diagnosis, stimulus valence, and drug session for behavioral and MEG data. RESULTS: In baseline behavioral analyses, MDD participants exhibited higher accuracy for sad-angry than happy-neutral faces, and HVs responded faster to happy-neutral than sad-angry faces. In the MEG post-infusion analyses, calcarine M100 amplitudes were larger in MDD than HV participants post-placebo but became more similar post-ketamine. Finally, fusiform M170 amplitudes were associated with antidepressant response in MDD participants. LIMITATIONS: The modest sample size and the need to collapse across responses to happy and neutral faces to increase statistical power limit the generalizability of the findings. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine rapidly altered emotional stimulus processing in MDD, laying the groundwork for future investigations of biomarkers of antidepressant treatment response.

3195,"Pilot study of psilocybin treatment for anxiety in patients with advanced-stage cancer.^
CONTEXT: Researchers conducted extensive investigations of hallucinogens in the 1950s and 1960s. By the early 1970s, however, political and cultural pressures forced the cessation of all projects. This investigation reexamines a potentially promising clinical application of hallucinogens in the treatment of anxiety reactive to advanced-stage cancer. OBJECTIVE: To explore the safety and efficacy of psilocybin in patients with advanced-stage cancer and reactive anxiety. DESIGN: A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of patients with advanced-stage cancer and anxiety, with subjects acting as their own control, using a moderate dose (0.2 mg/kg) of psilocybin. SETTING: A clinical research unit within a large public sector academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Twelve adults with advanced-stage cancer and anxiety. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: In addition to monitoring safety and subjective experience before and during experimental treatment sessions, follow-up data including results from the Beck Depression Inventory, Profile of Mood States, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory were collected unblinded for 6 months after treatment. RESULTS: Safe physiological and psychological responses were documented during treatment sessions. There were no clinically significant adverse events with psilocybin. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory trait anxiety subscale demonstrated a significant reduction in anxiety at 1 and 3 months after treatment. The Beck Depression Inventory revealed an improvement of mood that reached significance at 6 months; the Profile of Mood States identified mood improvement after treatment with psilocybin that approached but did not reach significance. CONCLUSIONS: This study established the feasibility and safety of administering moderate doses of psilocybin to patients with advanced-stage cancer and anxiety. Some of the data revealed a positive trend toward improved mood and anxiety. These results support the need for more research in this long-neglected field.

Following a decades long period of investigational dormancy, there is renewed interest in employing psychedelics as psychiatric treatments. The academic journals, institutions, and countries that have helped sustain clinical psychedelic research and the evolution of the literature on clinical studies of psychedelics have only recently begun to be investigated. To expand upon this work, we conducted a bibliometric analysis of clinical studies of 5-methoxy-N, N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT), ayahuasca, dimethyltryptamine (DMT), lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), ibogaine, mescaline, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), and psilocybin published from 1965-2021. Our search revealed 394 relevant articles. After a lull from the 1970s-1990s, publications in this area have resurged. Studies most frequently focused on MDMA (49%), LSD (19%), psilocybin (18%), and ayahuasca (7%). A subanalysis of studies from 1965 to 2009 (""Older cohort"") compared to 2010-2021 (""Recent cohort"") revealed that the Recent cohort had a higher proportion of studies investigating psychedelics' therapeutic applications and a lower proportion of studies investigating the effects of psychedelics on people using them in non-research settings. Compared to the Older cohort, psilocybin studies increased proportionally in the Recent cohort, while DMT and mescaline studies decreased.

5674,"A retrospective study of ketamine administration and the development of acute or post-traumatic stress disorder in 274 war-wounded soldiers.^
The objective of this study was to explore whether ketamine prevents or exacerbates acute or post-traumatic stress disorders in military trauma patients. We conducted a retrospective study of a database from the French Military Health Service, including all soldiers surviving a war injury in Afghanistan (2010-2012). The diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder was made by a psychiatrist and patients were analysed according to the presence or absence of this condition. Analysis included the following covariables: age; sex; acute stress disorder; blast injury; associated fatality; brain injury; traumatic amputation; Glasgow coma scale; injury severity score; administered drugs; number of surgical procedures; physical, neurosensory or aesthetic sequelae; and the development chronic pain. Covariables related to post-traumatic and acute stress disorders with a p ≤ 0.10 were included in a multivariable logistic regression model. The data from 450 soldiers were identified; 399 survived, of which 274 were analysed. Among these, 98 (36%) suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and 89 (32%) had received ketamine. Fifty-four patients (55%) in the post-traumatic stress disorder group received ketamine vs. 35 (20%) in the no PTSD group (p < 0.001). The 89 injured soldiers who received ketamine had a median (IQR [range]) injury severity score of 5 (3-13 [1-26]) vs. 3 (2-4 [1-6] in the 185 patients who did not (p < 0.001).

9436,"Psilocybin for End-of-Life Anxiety Symptoms: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.^
OBJECTIVE: To systematically examine the effectiveness and tolerability of psilocybin for treating end-of-life anxiety symptoms. METHODS: The Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, and PsycINFO databases were searched up to November 25, 2020. We enrolled clinical trials investigating psilocybin for treating end-of-life anxiety symptoms. Meta-analysis was conducted using random-effects model. RESULTS: Overall, five studies were included, revealing that psilocybin was superior to the placebo in treating state anxiety at 1 day (Hedges' g, -0.70; 95% confidence interval, -1.01 to -0.39) and 2 weeks (-1.03; -1.47 to -0.60) after treatment. Psilocybin was more effective than placebo in treating trait anxiety at 1 day (-0.71; -1.15 to -0.26), 2 weeks (-1.08; -1.80 to -0.36), and 6 months (-0.84; -1.37 to -0.30) after treatment. Psilocybin was associated with transient elevation in systolic (19.00; 13.58-24.41 mm Hg) and diastolic (8.66; 5.18-12.15 mm Hg) blood pressure compared with placebo. The differences between psilocybin and placebo groups with regard to allcause discontinuation, serious adverse events, and heart rates were nonsignificant. CONCLUSION: Psilocybin-assisted therapy could ameliorate end-of-life anxiety symptoms without serious adverse events.

657,"Neuropsychological Functioning in Users of Serotonergic Psychedelics - A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.^
Background: Serotonergic psychedelics (SPs) like LSD, psilocybin, DMT, and mescaline are a heterogeneous group of substances that share agonism at 5-HT2a receptors. Besides the ability of these substances to facilitate profoundly altered states of consciousness, persisting psychological effects have been reported after single administrations, which outlast the acute psychedelic effects. In this review and meta-analysis, we investigated if repeated SP use associates with a characteristic neuropsychological profile indicating persisting effects on neuropsychological function. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of studies investigating the neuropsychological performance in SP users, searching studies in Medline, Web of Science, embase, , and EudraCT. Studies were included if they reported at least one neuropsychological measurement in users of SPs. Studies comparing SP users and non-users that reported mean scores and standard deviations were included in an exploratory meta-analysis. Results: 13 studies (N = 539) published between 1969 and 2020 were included in this systematic review. Overall, we found that only three SPs were specifically investigated: ayahuasca (6 studies, n = 343), LSD (5 studies, n = 135), and peyote (1 study, n = 61). However, heterogeneity of the methodological quality was high across studies, with matching problems representing the most important limitation. Across all SPs, no uniform pattern of neuropsychological impairment was identified. Rather, the individual SPs seemed to be associated with distinct neuropsychological profiles. For instance, one study (n = 42) found LSD users to perform worse in trials A and B of the Trail-Making task, whereas meta-analytic assessment (5 studies, n = 352) of eleven individual neuropsychological measures indicated a better performance of ayahuasca users in the Stroop incongruent task (p = 0.03) and no differences in the others (all p > 0.05). Conclusion: The majority of the included studies were not completely successful in controlling for confounders such as differences in non-psychedelic substance use between SP-users and non-users. Our analysis suggests that LSD, ayahuasca and peyote may have different neuropsychological consequences associated with their use. While LSD users showed reduced executive functioning and peyote users showed no differences across domains, there is some evidence that ayahuasca use is associated with increased executive functioning.",1,"[0.0036352076567709446, 0.9963647723197937]",1
8429,"Dose-Dependent Effects of Psilocybin on Language Produced Under Natural Conditions.^
Background: While the effects of low and high doses of psilocybin have been investigated in laboratory settings using standardized tasks and questionnaires, the validity of this approach can be questioned due to the influence of contextual factors. We report the results of two studies conducted under natural conditions based on the analysis of free unconstrained speech: a study of language produced during the effects of a psilocybin microdose (study 1) and a study of verbal interactions between a group of participants who consumed psilocybin during a retreat (study 2). Methods: Study 1 followed a double‐blind placebo‐controlled design (N = 35, 0.5 g of dried psilocybin mushrooms or an inert placebo). Natural language was recorded during the acute effects, when participants answered a series of questions about different topics. Study 2 was a single blind randomized study (N = 100 participants divided into two matched groups, receiving 1 g or 3 g of dried psilocybin mushrooms, administered by a facilitator in the context of a retreat). Natural language was recorded during group interactions after the acute effects. Both studies included male and female participants. Language samples were analyzed in terms of verbosity, sentiment analysis, semantic coherence, and topic detection. Pairwise comparisons were conducted using Wilcoxon (Study 1) or Mann‐Whitney (Study 2) non‐parametric tests. Mushroom samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography‐mass spectrometry. Results: In Study 1 we found that a low dose of psilocybin (close to 1 mg of psilocybin) resulted in enhanced positive sentiment and higher verbosity. In Study 2 we found that a higher dose of psilocybin (in the range of 10 mg) resulted in both positive sentiment and higher verbosity (with longer turns taken by participants in the conversation), and decreased semantic coherence, but with smaller effect sizes than those reported in a previous study of LSD. The prevalence of topics related to visual perception and ego dissolution was significantly increased in the high vs. low dose condition. Conclusions: We conclude that natural language is sensitive to the reported effects of low and high doses of psilocybin consumed in different contexts. Natural language analysis should be further explored as a potentially valuable tool to quantify the contents of unconstrained reports after psychedelic experiences.",1,"[0.0025841775350272655, 0.9974157810211182]",1
6426,"Effects of experimental acute tryptophan depletion on acoustic startle response in females.^
Previous studies suggest an important role for serotonergic (5-HT) modulation of the acoustic startle reflex (ASR) and prepulse inhibition (PPI). Acute challenge of brain serotonin by means of tryptophan depletion test (TDT) represents an established human challenge tool for temporary reduction of tryptophan (-TRP) levels and central nervous serotonin. Under these experimental conditions, PPI was found attenuated in males, but greater biochemical effects of TDT in the central nervous system of females are known. Therefore, in order to explore influence of 5-HT on various standard startle parameters in females, 16 young healthy females participated in a double-blind, cross-over TDT study. Acoustic stimuli were presented in 15 pulse-alone trials (100 dB, 40 ms) randomly followed by 25 pulse-alone or prepulse (70 dB, 30 ms; 120 ms interval) trials alongside electromyographic eyeblink recordings and mood state assessments. During 81% depletion of free plasma TRP, mean ASR magnitudes were significantly reduced compared to control (+TRP) condition while there were no differences in habituation or PPI nor did startle parameters correlate with mood states. Changes of plasma TRP and mood states correlated in tendency negatively in (-TRP) for depression and positively in (+TRP) for fatigue. In conclusion, this first study of startle parameters after TDT in a homogenous female population demonstrates that depletion of brain 5-HT in women only influences ASR.",0,"[0.9908248782157898, 0.009175112470984459]",0
8839,"The changing outlook of psychedelic drugs: The importance of risk assessment and occupational exposure limits.^
Serotonergic psychedelics, such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin, dimethyltryptamine (DMT), and 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT), are currently being investigated for the treatment of psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety. Clinical trials with psilocybin and LSD have shown improvement in emotional and psychological scores. Although these drugs are reported to be safe in a controlled environment (such as clinical trials), exposure to low doses of these drugs can result in psychedelic effects, and therefore, occupational safety is an important consideration to prevent adverse effects in the workplace from low daily exposure. This article will discuss the factors involved in the derivation of occupational exposure limits (OELs) and risk assessment of these psychedelic drugs. To support the OEL derivations of psychedelic drugs, information regarding their mechanism of action, adverse effect profiles, pharmacokinetics, clinical effects, and nonclinical toxicity were considered. Additionally, psilocybin and LSD, which are the most extensively researched psychedelic substances, are employed as illustrative examples in case studies. The OELs derived for psilocybin and for LSD are 0.05 and 0.002 μg/m(3) , respectively, which indicates that these are highly hazardous compounds, and it is important to take into account suitable safety measures and risk-management strategies in order to minimize workplace exposure.",0,"[0.9943004846572876, 0.005699537228792906]",0

7258,"Case report: Maintaining altered states of consciousness over repeated ketamine infusions may be key to facilitate long-lasting antidepressant effects: some initial lessons from a personalized-dosing single-case study.^
BackgroundThe interest in psychoactive agents for treating mental disorders has gathered a growing body of scientific interest. However, research on the relationship between altered states of consciousness (ASCs) and ketamine's antidepressant properties is still limited. Likewise, approaches to sustain early treatment success for the long-term are needed. Taking both aspects into account, the question arises whether the persistence of recurrent ASCs during the subsequent infusion sessions is crucial for the preservation of antidepressant effects during prolonged continued ketamine therapy.AimIn this case study we explored whether recurrent ASC experiences across a large number of infusions are associated with improved antidepressant effects in a single case study.MethodsA 62-year-old patient with treatment-resistant depression, who has been suffering from depressive episodes for over 20 years, was observed for 12 consecutive infusions across 16 weeks. ASCs during ketamine sessions were measured with the 5D-ASC, and pre/post-infusion depression scores with the BDI-II questionnaire. To emphasize psychoactive experiences a personalized antidepressant dose regimen was used.ResultsWe found a strong correlation between the experienced ASCs during ketamine infusions and the antidepressant effect: the stronger the ASCs overall, the stronger the resulting antidepressant effect. This correlation was consistently observed throughout the infusion series, independent of the number of ketamine sessions completed before. However, despite a personalized dose regimen, neither peri-infusion ASCs nor antidepressant effects could be established on a regular basis, leading overall to no improvement in treatment outcome.ConclusionMaintaining psychoactive effects over repeated ketamine infusions may be key to facilitate long-lasting antidepressant effects. However, for some depressed individuals maintenance of antidepressant effects and/or peri-infusion ASCs might not be achieved, even when personalized dosing is used.",1,"[0.0038921963423490524, 0.9961077570915222]",1
6637,"Shifts in Unintentional Exposure to Drugs Among People Who Use Ecstasy in the Electronic Dance Music Scene, 2016-2019.^
Background and Objectives: Electronic dance music (EDM) party attendees who use ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine [MDMA], Molly) are at high risk for ingesting adulterant drugs, but little is known regarding trends in exposure. We sought to determine whether adulteration has shifted in recent years. Methods: Adults entering EDM events at nightclubs and dance festivals in NYC were surveyed in 2016 and 2019. We tested hair samples from a subsample of those reporting past-year ecstasy use using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography—tandem mass spectrometry. Differences in unreported drug exposure and suspected adulteration were compared between 2016 (n = 90) and 2019 (n = 72). Results: MDMA detection was stable at 72-74%. We detected decreases in unreported use of methamphetamine (from 22.2% to 5.6% [P =.003], an 74.8% decrease), new psychoactive substances (from 31.1% to 2.8% [P <.001], a 91.0% decrease), and synthetic cathinones in particular (from 27.8% to 2.8% (P <.001, an 89.9% decrease). Unreported ketamine exposure increased from 18.9% to 34.7% (P =.022, an 83.6% increase). We also detected decreases in participantsʼ suspicion of their ecstasy being adulterated with methamphetamine (from 20.0% to 5.6% [P =.010], an 72.0% decrease) and “bath salts” (synthetic cathinones, from 8.9% to 1.4% [P =.044], an 84.3% decrease). Discussion and Conclusions: Unknown exposure to adulterants among people who use ecstasy in the EDM scene is shifting. Monitoring of exposure to adulterants is needed to inform harm reduction. Scientific Significance: This was among the first studies to examine unintentional exposure to drugs over time in this population and unintentional exposure to synthetic cathinones in particular appears to be declining.

1869,"Survey of entity encounter experiences occasioned by inhaled N,N-dimethyltryptamine: Phenomenology, interpretation, and enduring effects.^
Background: Experiences of having an encounter with seemingly autonomous entities are sometimes reported after inhaling N,N-dimethyltryptamine. Aim: The study characterized the subjective phenomena, interpretation, and persisting changes that people attribute to N,N-dimethyltryptamine-occasioned entity encounter experiences. Methods: Two thousand, five hundred and sixty-one individuals (mean age 32 years; 77% male) completed an online survey about their single most memorable entity encounter after taking N,N-dimethyltryptamine. Results: Respondents reported the primary senses involved in the encounter were visual and extrasensory (e.g. telepathic). The most common descriptive labels for the entity were being, guide, spirit, alien, and helper. Although 41% of respondents reported fear during the encounter, the most prominent emotions both in the respondent and attributed to the entity were love, kindness, and joy. Most respondents endorsed that the entity had the attributes of being conscious, intelligent, and benevolent, existed in some real but different dimension of reality, and continued to exist after the encounter. Respondents endorsed receiving a message (69%) or a prediction about the future (19%) from the experience. More than half of those who identified as atheist before the experience no longer identified as atheist afterwards. The experiences were rated as among the most meaningful, spiritual, and psychologically insightful lifetime experiences, with persisting positive changes in life satisfaction, purpose, and meaning attributed to the experiences. Conclusion: N,N-dimethyltryptamine-occasioned entity encounter experiences have many similarities to non-drug entity encounter experiences such as those described in religious, alien abduction, and near-death contexts. Aspects of the experience and its interpretation produced profound and enduring ontological changes in worldview.",0,"[0.975239098072052, 0.02476087026298046]",1
2631,"Driving Under the Influence of Cannabis: Impact of Combining Toxicology Testing with Field Sobriety Tests.^
BACKGROUND: Cannabis is increasingly used both medically and recreationally. With widespread use, there is growing concern about how to identify cannabis-impaired drivers. METHODS: A placebo-controlled randomized double-blinded protocol was conducted to study the effects of cannabis on driving performance. One hundred ninety-one participants were randomized to smoke ad libitum a cannabis cigarette containing placebo or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (5.9% or 13.4%). Blood, oral fluid (OF), and breath samples were collected along with longitudinal driving performance on a simulator (standard deviation of lateral position [SDLP] and car following [coherence]) over a 5-hour period. Law enforcement officers performed field sobriety tests (FSTs) to determine if participants were impaired. RESULTS: There was no relationship between THC concentrations measured in blood, OF, or breath and SDLP or coherence at any of the timepoints studied (P > 0.05). FSTs were significant (P < 0.05) for classifying participants into the THC group vs the placebo group up to 188 minutes after smoking. Seventy-one minutes after smoking, FSTs classified 81% of the participants who received active drug as being impaired. However, 49% of participants who smoked placebo (controls) were also deemed impaired at this same timepoint. Combining a 2 ng/mL THC cutoff in OF with positive findings on FSTs reduced the number of controls classified as impaired to zero, 86 minutes after smoking the placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Requiring a positive toxicology result in addition to the FST observations substantially improved the classification accuracy regarding possible driving under the influence of THC by decreasing the percentage of controls classified as impaired.",0,"[0.9867430925369263, 0.013256910257041454]",0
215,"Safety, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of multiple oral doses of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol in older persons with dementia.^
RATIONALE: Data on safety, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are lacking in dementia patients. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, we evaluated the safety, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of THC in ten patients with dementia (mean age 77.3 ± 5.6). For 12 weeks, participants randomly received oral THC (weeks 1-6, 0.75 mg; weeks 7-12, 1.5 mg) or placebo twice daily for 3 days, separated by a 4-day washout period. RESULTS: Only 6 of the 98 reported adverse events were related to THC. Visual analog scale (VAS) feeling high, VAS external perception, body sway-eyes-open, and diastolic blood pressure were not significantly different with THC. After the 0.75-mg dose, VAS internal perception (0.025 units; 95% CI 0.010-0.040) and heart rate (2 beats/min; 95% CI 0.4-3.8) increased significantly. Body sway-eyes-closed increased only after 1.5 mg (0.59°/s; 95% CI 0.13-1.06). Systolic blood pressure changed significantly after both doses of THC (0.75 mg, -7 mmHg, 95% CI -11.4, -3.0; 1.5 mg, 5 mmHg, 95% CI 1.0-9.2). The median T max was 1-2 h, with THC pharmacokinetics increasing linearly with increasing dose, with wide interindividual variability (CV% up to 140%). The mean C max (ng/mL) after the first dose (0-6 h) was 0.41 (0.18-0.90) for the 0.75-mg dose and 1.01 (0.53-1.92) for the 1.5-mg dose. After the second dose (6-24 h), the C max was 0.50 (0.27-0.92) and 0.98 (0.46-2.06), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: THC was rapidly absorbed and had dose-linear pharmacokinetics with considerable interindividual variation. Pharmacodynamic effects, including adverse events, were minor. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the pharmacodynamics and efficacy of higher THC doses in older persons with dementia.",0,"[0.9847753643989563, 0.015224646776914597]",0
4843,"Does getting high hurt? Characterization of cases of LSD and psilocybin-containing mushroom exposures to national poison centers between 2000 and 2016.^
Background: Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin are serotonergic hallucinogens that are used primarily for recreational abuse. Small studies evaluated the efficacy of LSD and psilocybin for several psychiatric conditions. There are limited safety or toxicity data for either of these substances, especially in large populations. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of single-substance exposures of LSD or psilocybin-containing mushrooms (PcMs) reported to United States poison centers from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2016. The study describes the most frequent toxicities, management sites, and medical outcomes. Results: A total of 5883 PcM and 3554 LSD exposures were included. Most patients were between 13 and 29 years of age (83.9% PcM, 88.9% LSD) and primarily male (77.9% PcM, 74.1% LSD). Most common clinical effects were hallucinations (45.8% PcM, 37.4% LSD), agitation (24.1% PcM, 42.4% LSD), and tachycardia (18.0% PcM, 38.6% LSD). Serious clinical effects were infrequent, but included hyperthermia, seizures, coma, increased serum creatinine, and cardiac arrest. Most patients were treated and released from the emergency department. More LSD patients were admitted to critical care and non-critical care units than PcM patients. Moderate effect was the most frequent outcome for both substances (61.0% PcM, 62.3% LSD). Conclusion: These data find that LSD and PcM use occurs primarily in adolescents and young adults, who experience mild to moderate adverse effects. Serious effects are infrequent but can occur. While most LSD and PcM users require only emergency department management, LSD use is more likely to require medical admission.",1,"[0.0039251684211194515, 0.9960748553276062]",1

Individuals who call research staff will undergo an initial telephone screen that will determine eligibility. Week 1: Baseline Intake Appointment. Those who are eligible to participate on the basis of the telephone screen and provide informed consent will then complete a standard demographic questionnaire, a detailed psychiatric interview, and provide a urine sample for confirmation of substance abstinence and pregnancy status. Participants will then be administered a detailed medical history interview and physical examination including EKG and blood panel. Week 2: Orientation. Participants who are medically eligible to participate will be scheduled for a psychoeducational orientation session that further explains the rationale of the study, and summarizes the study logistics. Participants will complete a number of baseline questionnaires and neuropsychological assessments at this time. Week 3: Drug administration #1. In a betweenâ€groups design, participants will be randomized to receive 0 mg, 1 mg, 2.5 mg, or 5 mg of psilocybin at five weekly 6â€hour long drug administration sessions. Dose will remain constant for each participant at each drug administration session. At Drug Administration #1 and all subsequent drug administration sessions, participants will complete visual analogue scale (VAS) questions drawn from different sources that include drug abuse liability measures. These VAS questions will be administered at drug administration baseline and every 30 minutes thereafter through the end of acute effects at 6â€hrs postâ€baseline. Research staff will complete a number of observational assessments at similar intervals. Blood pressure will be assessed at regular intervals via automatic blood pressure monitor (i.e., at baseline and at 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, and 360 min postâ€baseline), and medication for the treatment of acute hypertension will be administered should blood pressure exceed 200 systolic and/or 110 diastolic. At peak drug effects (2 hr postâ€baseline), a number of measures will be administered, each differing by drug administration session. At Drug Administration #1, participants will undergo two electroencephalogram (EEG) tasks (with assessments at baseline serving as preâ€drug control values). At 6â€hr postâ€baseline, participants will complete selfâ€report measures assessing the subjective experience. These questionnaires will be administered at the conclusion of each drug administration session. Participants will then be administered a brief semiâ€structured qualitative interview designed to probe the nature of their experience. All participants will be required to arrange for transportation home from the CRU; participants will not be allowed to drive themselves after drug administration sessions. Week 4: Drug Administration #2. This session will be identical to Drug Administration #1, however, at peak drug effects, participants will complete two new EEG tasks (with assessments at baseline serving as preâ€drug control values). Week 5: Drug Administration #3. This session will be identical to prior drug administration sessions, however, at peak drug effects, a neuropsychological measure will be administered. Week 6: Drug Administration #4. This session will be identical to prior drug administration sessions, however, at peak drug effects, participants will complete another neuropsychological measure. Week 7: Drug Administration #5. This session will be identical to prior drug administration sessions, however, at peak drug effects, participants will complete another neuropsychological measure. At the conclusion of this measure, subjects will undergo an EEG assessment (with an assessment at baseline serving as a preâ€drug control value). Week 8: Study Termination. This session will comprise completion of the same questionnaires that were previously completed at baseline as well as a semiâ€structured qualitative interview.

5092,"Effects of cannabinoids on resting state functional brain connectivity: A systematic review.^
Cannabis products are widely used for medical and non-medical reasons worldwide and vary in content of cannabinoids such as delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). Resting state functional connectivity offers a powerful tool to investigate the effects of cannabinoids on the human brain. We systematically reviewed functional neuroimaging evidence of connectivity during acute cannabinoid administration. A pre-registered (PROSPERO ID: CRD42020184264) systematic review of 13 studies comprising 318 participants (mean age of 25 years) was conducted and reported using the PRISMA checklist. During THC and THCv exposure vs placebo reduced connectivity with the NAcc was widely reported. Limited evidence shows that such effects are offset by co-administration of CBD. NAcc-frontal region connectivity was associated with intoxication levels. Cannabis intoxication vs placebo was associated with lower striatal-ACC connectivity. CBD and CBDv vs placebo were associated with both higher and lower connectivity between striatal-prefrontal/other regions. Overall, cannabis and cannabinoids change functional connectivity in the human brain during resting state as a function of the type of cannabinoid examined.",0,"[0.988807737827301, 0.011192291975021362]",0
7167,"High-potency marijuana impairs executive function and inhibitory motor control.^
Human performance studies have usually relied on low-potency marijuana (4% THC) for determining THC-induced impairment. The present study was designed to assess the effects of high-potency marijuana (13% THC) on human performance. In all, 20 recreational users of marijuana participated in a double-blind, placebo controlled, three way cross-over study. The treatments consisted of single doses of 0, 250, and 500 microg/kg THC. Performance tests were conducted at regular intervals between 15 min and 6 h postsmoking and included measures of motor control (Critical tracking task), executive function (Tower of London) motor impulsivity (Stop signal task), and risk taking (Iowa gambling task). THC significantly impaired performance in the Critical tracking task and decreased the number of correct decisions in the Tower of London task. In addition, THC significantly increased stop reaction time and the proportions of commission and omission errors in the Stop signal task. THC-induced impairments lasted up to 6 h postsmoking as indicated by the absence of a THC x Time after smoking interaction. Effect sizes for performance impairments produced by THC 250 microg/kg were relatively low but generally increased by a factor of two in case of THC 500 microg/kg. These data suggest that high potency marijuana consistently impairs executive function and motor control. Use of higher doses of THC in controlled studies may offer a reliable indication of THC induced impairment as compared to lower doses of THC that have traditionally been used in performance studies.",0,"[0.9908677339553833, 0.009132219478487968]",0
1714,"A field evaluation of five on-site drug-testing devices.^
A field study was performed at two police agencies to evaluate the utility and accuracy of five on-site urine analysis drug-testing devices when used to test driving under the influence (DUI) arrestees. The devices evaluated were AccuSign, Rapid Drug Screen, TesTcup-5, TesTstik, and Triage. Standard workplace screening cut-off concentrations were used and samples were tested for marijuana, cocaine and metabolites, amphetamine(s), opiates, and PCP (except opiates 300 ng/mL). Four-hundred arrestees were recruited at each site, informed consent was obtained, and urine specimens were collected from each subject for analysis. Police officers conducted the testing with one device, and trained technicians performed testing with the other four devices. The device used by the officers was rotated. All positive and 5% of the negative samples were confirmed in a laboratory using mass spectrometry. Laboratory cut-off concentrations were 4 ng/mL for carboxy-THC; 50 ng/mL for benzoylecgonine; 100 ng/mL for amphetamines; 50 ng/mL for opiates; and 5 ng/mL for PCP. Approximately one-third (36%) of the subjects tested positive for at least one drug. No randomly selected sample, that tested negative on the devices, tested positive at the laboratory. Based on 800 specimens, the false-negative rate for each device was < 1% for all drug classes. A false positive was defined as testing positive with the device, but the specimen did not contain detectable drug, given the study reporting criteria. For marijuana, benzoylecgonine, and opiates, all devices had < or = 0.25% false-positive rates. For PCP, the false-positive rates were all < or = 1.5%. For amphetamine(s), the false-positive rates were all < or = 1.75%. These rates were adjusted because study confirmation batteries included methylenedioxyamphetamine, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), additional over-the-counter sympathomimetic amines, hydromorphone, and hydrocodone. Without the expanded confirmation battery, false-positive rates approached 4% (Triage) for amphetamines and were > or = 2.25% for opiates. Fifty to 90% of the positive amphetamine(s) samples contained MDMA. A similar percentage of the opiate-positive samples contained hydromorphone or hydrocodone. When additional drugs were included in the confirmation testing, it was concluded that the on-site urine analysis drug-testing results were useful in DUI investigations.",0,"[0.9841552972793579, 0.015844767913222313]",0

The abuse of ecstasy-type drugs such as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) is generally associated with young adults attending ""Rave"" parties. Little toxicological information has been reported regarding ecstasy usage by individuals undergoing monitoring in other settings in the United States. The goal of this study was to determine the prevalence and patterns of licit and illicit drugs in urine specimens of ecstasy users. A survey of laboratory data over the years 2005-2007 revealed that 198 urine specimens were confirmed positive (cutoff concentration 100 ng/mL) for MDMA and/or MDA from the following types of donors (# positive specimens): Correctional (159); Sports (19); Workplace (9); Pain Patients (8); and Special Test Requests (3). Of these, 122 (61.6%) were positive for MDMA and MDA, 70 (35.4%) were positive for MDMA, and 6 (3.0%) were positive for MDA. A majority (84.3%) of the specimens contained multiple drugs and/or metabolites in addition to MDMA and MDA. The median number of drugs/metabolites reported for these ecstasy users was 5 (range, 1-9).

Purpose/Background: As a sole agent, ketamine acutely compromises driving ability; however, performance after coadministration with the adjuvant sedating agents dexmedetomidine or fentanyl is unclear. Methods/Procedures: Using a randomized within-subject design, 39 participants (mean ± SD age, 28.4 ± 5.8 years) received 0.3 mg/kg bolus followed by 0.15 mg kg−1 h−1 infusion of ketamine (3-hour duration), in addition to either (i) 0.7 μg kg−1 h−1 infusion of dexmedetomidine for 1.5 hours (n = 19; KET/DEX) or (ii) three 25 μg fentanyl injections for 1.5 hours (n = 20; KET/FENT). Whole blood drug concentrations were determined during ketamine only, at coadministration (KET/DEX or KET/FENT) and at 2 hours after treatment. Subjective effects were determined using a standardized visual analog scale. Driving performance was assessed at baseline and at posttreatment using a validated computerized driving simulator. Primary outcomes included SD of lateral position (SDLP) and steering variability (SV). Findings/Results: Administration of ketamine with dexmedetomidine but not fentanyl significantly increased SDLP (F1,18 = 22.60, P < 0.001) and reduced SV (F1,18 = 164.42, P < 0.001) 2 hours after treatment. These deficits were comparatively greater for the KET/DEX group than for the KET/FENT group (t₃₇ = −5.21 [P < 0.001] and t₃₇ = 5.22 [P < 0.001], (respectively). For the KET/DEX group, vehicle control (SV) and self-rated performance (visual analog scale), but not SDLP, was inversely associated with ketamine and norketamine blood concentrations (in nanograms per milliliter). Greater subjective effects were moderately associated with driving deficits. Implications/Conclusions: Driving simulator performance is significantly compromised after coadministration of analgesic range doses of ketamine with dexmedetomidine but not fentanyl.

9486,"A randomized trial of an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist in treatment-resistant major depression.^
CONTEXT: Existing therapies for major depression have a lag of onset of action of several weeks, resulting in considerable morbidity. Exploring pharmacological strategies that have rapid onset of antidepressant effects within a few days and that are sustained would have an enormous impact on patient care. Converging lines of evidence suggest the role of the glutamatergic system in the pathophysiology and treatment of mood disorders. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a rapid antidepressant effect can be achieved with an antagonist at the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor in subjects with major depression. DESIGN: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study from November 2004 to September 2005. SETTING: Mood Disorders Research Unit at the National Institute of Mental Health. Patients Eighteen subjects with DSM-IV major depression (treatment resistant). INTERVENTIONS: After a 2-week drug-free period, subjects were given an intravenous infusion of either ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo on 2 test days, a week apart. Subjects were rated at baseline and at 40, 80, 110, and 230 minutes and 1, 2, 3, and 7 days postinfusion. Main Outcome Measure Changes in scores on the primary efficacy measure, the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. RESULTS: Subjects receiving ketamine showed significant improvement in depression compared with subjects receiving placebo within 110 minutes after injection, which remained significant throughout the following week.

For the obsessive neuroses, a distinct connection was found between the reported result of the treatment and the number of treatments. One patient had tried LSD on his own, but no indications of abuse among the patients were obtained. The study could not confirm any hereditary consequences of the LSD treatment.

959,"Self-Medication for Chronic Pain Using Classic Psychedelics: A Qualitative Investigation to Inform Future Research.^
Background: Chronic Pain is among the leading causes of disability worldwide with up to 60% of patients suffering from comorbid depression. Psychedelic-assisted therapy has recently been found effective in treating a host of mental health issues including depression and has historically been found to be useful in treating pain. Reports of self-medication for chronic pain using psychedelic drugs have been widely documented, with anecdotal evidence indicating widespread success in a range of pathologies. Aims: In preparation for an upcoming trial, to better understand how those with lived experience of chronic pain self-medicate with psychedelic drugs, and to establish, in detail, their therapeutic protocols and practices for success. Methods: As part of patient-involvement (PI) for an upcoming trial in this population, 11 individuals who reported self-medicating with psychedelic drugs took part in a 1-h semi-structured discussion, which was then transcribed and thematically analyzed. Results: Across a range of psychedelic substances and doses, reported pain scores improved substantially during and after psychedelic experiences. Two processes, Positive Reframing and Somatic Presence, were reliably identified as playing a role in improvements in mental wellbeing, relationship with pain, and physical (dis)comfort. Inclusion of other strategies such as mindfulness, breathwork, and movement were also widely reported. Due to the data's subjective nature, this paper is vulnerable to bias and makes no claims on causality or generalisability. Together, these results have been used to inform study design for a forthcoming trial. Conclusion: This pre-trial PI work gives us confidence to test psychedelic therapy for chronic pain in a forthcoming controlled trial. The results presented here will be instrumental in improving our ability to meet the needs of future study participants.",1,"[0.09620251506567001, 0.903797447681427]",1
579,"Ketamine in the Treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: A Systematic Review.^
INTRODUCTION: First-line treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) includes exposure and response prevention behavioral therapy and serotonin reuptake inhibitors, particularly in combination. New and more effective treatments are needed, give that recent studies suggest that glutamatergic neurotransmission contributes to the pathophysiology of the disorder. In these circumstances, ketamine, as a potent N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist and glutamate modulator, offers alternative possibilities for OCD treatment. METHODS: This systematic review aims to investigate the effects of ketamine in OCD, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P). Searches were carried out using the PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO databases. RESULTS: Nine articles were included, of which three were randomized controlled trials, three case reports, two open-label trials, and one a retrospective chart review. Reported data have shown a potential for fast onset of action and good tolerability of ketamine for OCD, even though the principal studies used only single-session racemic ketamine treatments, administered intravenously, and the results have been erratic. In addition, none of the available evidence demonstrates whether racemic ketamine, S-ketamine, or R-ketamine has the best efficacy in controlling OCD symptoms, and only sparse evidence suggests that a combination of ketamine and psychotherapy could benefit patients with OCD. CONCLUSION: In order to advance clinical practice regarding the use of ketamine in treating OCD, future randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are required. These trials need to use larger samples to explore ketamine and its enantiomers, with different methods of administration, multiple sessions, and appropriate washout periods.",1,"[0.0029807493556290865, 0.9970192909240723]",1
356,"Microdosing psychedelics: personality, mental health, and creativity differences in microdosers.^
RATIONALE: Microdosing psychedelics-the regular consumption of small amounts of psychedelic substances such as LSD or psilocybin-is a growing trend in popular culture. Recent studies on full-dose psychedelic psychotherapy reveal promising benefits for mental well-being, especially for depression and end-of-life anxiety. While full-dose therapies include perception-distorting properties, microdosing mayprovide complementary clinical benefits using lower-risk, non-hallucinogenic doses. OBJECTIVES: This pre-registered study aimed to investigate whether microdosing psychedelics is related to differences in personality, mental health, and creativity. METHODS: In this observational study, respondents recruited from online forums self-reported their microdosing behaviors and completed questionnaires concerning dysfunctional attitudes, wisdom, negative emotionality, open-mindedness, and mood. Respondents also performed the Unusual Uses Task to assess their creativity. RESULTS: Current and former microdosers scored lower on measures of dysfunctional attitudes (p < 0.001, r = - 0.92) and negative emotionality (p = 0.009, r = - 0.85) and higher on wisdom (p < 0.001, r = 0.88), openmindedness(p = 0.027, r = 0.67), and creativity (p < 0.001, r = 0.15) when compared to non-microdosing controls. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide promising initial evidence that warrants controlled experimental research to directly test safety and clinical efficacy. As microdoses are easier to administer than full-doses, this new paradigm has the exciting potential to shape future psychedelic research.",1,"[0.0042485627345740795, 0.9957513809204102]",1
1814,"The NEO-FFI domain of openness to experience moderates ketamine response in treatment resistant depression.^
BACKGROUND: There are many putative mechanisms by which ketamine has its effect and many unanswered questions about risks and benefits of long-term ketamine therapy. A research imperative is the identification of predictors of response to intravenous ketamine, especially a sustained response to maintenance ketamine. Temperament is an inherited aspect of personality and is a predictive factor for outcome in treatment resistant depressed (TRD) patients. METHODS: We analyzed which domains of personality impacted initial and sustained ketamine response. Utilizing the Neuroticism Extraversion Openness Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) on 125 participants with TRD, we tested (1) whether the degree of neuroticism predicted initial and/or sustained response to ketamine; and (2) whether extraversion, agreeableness, openness to experience, and conscientiousness had an impact on response. RESULTS: Our findings confirmed previous literature that elevated neuroticism, low conscientiousness, and low extraversion was the pattern of our TRD population regardless of response. Openness was the only factor to significantly predict sustained treatment outcome. LIMITATIONS: Our findings are limited by the lack of placebo control, small sample size, non- standardized infusion intervals, polypharmacy rather than ketamine monotherapy, a select TRD population in that they had all failed ECT, and a primarily Caucasian population. CONCLUSIONS: Our registry adds to the literature that factors making up temperament may have predictive value in regard to treatment response, specifically the outcome for TRD patients receiving long-term ketamine infusion therapy. If confirmed, assessing for Openness could reduce inappropriate exposure to ketamine with its attendant unknown long-term risks.",1,"[0.002485840115696192, 0.9975141286849976]",1
8496,"Single-dose intravenous ketamine or intramuscular naltrexone for high-utilization inpatients with alcohol use disorder: pilot trial feasibility and readmission rates.^
BACKGROUND: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) accounts for millions of acute care encounters annually in the United States. Hospitalization represents a vital opportunity to intervene pharmacologically, but low medication adherence is a significant barrier. Two single-dose, adherence-independent interventions are well suited for pre-discharge administration: intravenous (IV) ketamine and intramuscular (IM) naltrexone. Their feasibility and readmission-reducing efficacy in hospital settings are not well-established. METHODS: A 3-arm, open-label randomized trial was conducted at our safety-net medical hospital among high-utilization inpatients with severe AUD. Consented adults (age 18-65) were randomized to (1) IV ketamine (KET) 0.5 mg/kg over 40 min, (2) IM naltrexone (NTX) 380 mg once, or (3) linkage alone (LA). The primary clinical outcome was 30-day all-cause hospital readmission rate. All were provided enhanced linkage to outpatient addiction clinic. RESULTS: We consented and randomized 44 participants (n = 13, 14, 17 for KET, NTX, LA, respectively), with a mean of 3.2 past-year hospitalizations. Compared to the LA arm, both the KET arm (RR 0.37, p = 0.17) and NTX arm (RR 0.52, p = 0.27) had a lower 30-day readmission rate, though the differences were nonsignificant. Immediate acceptability ratings of KET and NTX were 9.50 and 9.17 out of 10, respectively. No serious adverse events or illicit ketamine use was reported. CONCLUSIONS: Both interventions are feasible and showed promise in reducing readmissions for high-utilization AUD inpatients. Despite randomization, baseline characteristics may have differed in ways that biased against the control arm. Additional pragmatic studies-with larger sample size, blinding, and robust follow-up data collection-are needed to verify findings and better understand mediating factors.

8469,"Letter to the editor about 'Comparative efficacy of racemic ketamine and esketamine for depression: A systematic review and meta-analysis'.^
Comments on an article by A. Bahji et al. (see record [rid]2020-91544-073[/rid]). The authors assessed the comparative efficacy and tolerability of racemic and esketamine for the treatment of unipolar and bipolar major depression using 24 randomized controlled trials. We appreciate their insightful conclusions, however, there are some controversial details need to be explained or fixed. First, in the 'Search Strategy' section, the authors claimed that they included trials examining the use of ketamine in adults (aged 18 years or older), however, their search strategy might be not full-scale. For example. 'depressive disorder' and 'melancholia' should also be added in the search strategy. Second, in the 'Study selection' section, two studies, conducted by Grunebaum in 2017 (Grunebaum et al., 2017) and 2018 (Grunebaum et al., 2018) respectively, are likely to contain repeated data. Third, the number of patients included in the selected studies was different. There were only 9 patients in Berman et al.'s (2000) and Diazgranados et al.'s (2010) studies, while Fedgchin et al. (2019) recruited 445 patients. It is highly recommended to analyze these data in different subgroups, rather than use only one group, which can greatly increase the influence of small sample research, and those small sample researches are generally not reliable. Fourth, only funnel plot was applied in this study when assessing publication bias, however, funnel plot was not an accurate tool to evaluate this, Begg's test and Egger's test are usually applied on this occasion.

7570,"Pre‐incisional analgesia with intravenous or subcutaneous infiltration of ketamine reduces postoperative pain in patients after open cholecystectomy: A randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study.^
Background: In literature, there is controversy on the use of ketamine for management of postoperative pain. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of pre-incisional intravenous or subcutaneous infiltration of ketamine on postoperative pain relief after open cholecystectomy. Methods: One hundred twenty patients, aged 18–60 years, scheduled for open cholecystectomy was enrolled in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients were divided into four groups of 30 each and received subcutaneous infiltration of ketamine 1 mg/kg (group KS1), subcutaneous infiltration of ketamine 2 mg/kg (group KS2), intravenous ketamine 1 mg/kg (group KI), or subcutaneous infiltration of normal saline 20 mL (group C) before surgery. Visual analog scale (VAS) values and analgesic consumption were evaluated for 24 hours after operation. Results: VAS scores were significantly lower at arrival to the postanesthesia care unit, 15 and 30 minutes in Group KS1, Group KS2, and Group KI compared with Group C (P < 0.05). In Group KS2, VAS scores were significantly lower than Group KS1 (P < 0.05). Postoperative VAS scores were significantly lower at 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after operation in Group KS1, Group KS2, and Group KI compared with Group C (P < 0.05). In Group KS2, VAS scores were significantly lower than Group KS1 (P < 0.05). Conclusion: A 2 mg/kg dose of subcutaneous infiltration ketamine or 1 mg/kg dose of intravenous ketamine given at approximately 15 minutes before surgery provides an adjunctive analgesia during 24 hours after surgery in patients undergoing cholecystectomy surgery.

5316,"An evaluation of a brief motivational intervention among young ecstasy and cocaine users: no effect on substance and alcohol use outcomes.^
AIMS: To investigate whether a stimulant- and alcohol-focused brief motivational intervention induces positive behaviour change among young, regular users of MDMA ('ecstasy'), cocaine powder and crack cocaine. DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS: A randomized trial of the intervention versus a control group who received written health risk information materials only. All participants completed a baseline self-assessment questionnaire before randomization. Outcome measures were self-reported period prevalence abstinence from ecstasy, cocaine powder and crack cocaine and the frequency and amount of stimulant and alcohol use in the previous 90 days, recorded at 6-month follow-up via self-completion questionnaire and personal interview. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: A total of 342 adolescent and young adult stimulant users (aged 16-22 years) were recruited and 87% were followed-up. The intervention was delivered by a team of 12 agency youth drug workers and two researchers at five locations in Greater London and south-east England. FINDINGS: There were no significant differences in abstinence for ecstasy, cocaine powder or crack cocaine use between the experimental and control groups. Contrasting follow-up with baseline self-reports, there were no between-group effects for changes in the frequency or amount of stimulant or alcohol use. Participant follow-up data suggested that the baseline assessment was a contributing factor in within-group behaviour change among experimental and control condition participants. CONCLUSIONS: Our brief motivational intervention was no more effective at inducing behaviour change than the provision of information alone. We hypothesize that research recruitment, baseline self-assessment and contact with study personnel are influences that induce positive reactive effects on stimulant use.",1,"[0.004358289763331413, 0.9956417083740234]",1

DMT was given in doses of 1.0, 3.2, and 10.0 mg/kg i.p. DMT was assayed spectro photo fluorometrically and in some instances by a radioisotopic method. The results show that the half life of DMT varied with different doses in the brain but not in the liver. Pretreatment with the monoamine oxidase inhibitors prolonged the total period during which DMT was found. A linear relationship exists between the mean time required to reach minimal DMT concentrations and the mean duration of suppression of FR4 barpressing behavior in rats trained for a milk reward.

4347,"Should we be leery of being Leary? Concerns about psychedelic use by psychedelic researchers.^
Psychedelic research is proceeding rapidly, despite ongoing legal and regulatory barriers and lingering questions about study design, such as the difficulty of ensuring adequate blinding, the relative overrepresentation in studies of participants who have previously used psychedelics, and the importance of personal experience with psychedelics for those who provide psychedelic-assisted therapy. Here we wish to explore a distinct concern: whether personal use of psychedelics by researchers could threaten the objectivity and ethical conduct of psychedelic research itself. In 2020, Anderson et al. suggested that psychedelic use could lead even ""conservative individuals to become wildly enthusiastic about the potentials of psychedelics to heal and transform"". Recent popular press criticisms of psychedelic science, in particular critiques of the MAPS Phase II and Phase III MDMA-Assisted Therapy trials for PTSD, have also raised questions about whether personal use of psychedelic drugs by psychedelic therapists could compromise scientific objectivity, lead to the exploitation of research subjects, or promote biased reporting of results. Here, we elaborate on and attempt to delimit these concerns, with the goal of informing policy related to psychedelic research and the eventual clinical use of psychedelics. In particular, we explore whether the possibility that psychedelic use can directly and positively affect investigators' enthusiasm about psychedelics themselves raises concerns about bias and scientific integrity. We then discuss several practical strategies to reduce perceived conflict of interest.",0,"[0.9941965341567993, 0.00580345094203949]",0

No clinical evidence on the efficacy and safety of eribulin monotherapy has been obtained by a prospective clinical study in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who had well-defined taxane resistance. The present Phase II, multicenter, single-arm, open-label study aimed to obtain the evidence. Japanese female patients, aged 33-74 years who had the metastasis of taxane-resistant and histopathologically confirmed breast cancer, received eribulin mesylate 1.4 mg/m(2) (equivalent to eribulin 1.23 mg/m(2) [expressed as free base]) as a 2- to 5-min intravenous infusion on days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle. The primary endpoint was the clinical benefit rate (CBR) [complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and long-term stable disease (LSD) ≥24 weeks]. A total of 51 patients underwent chemotherapy cycles (median 4; range 1-42 cycles). The CBR was 39.2 % (CR 2.0 %; PR 23.5 %; and LSD 13.7 %), and the rate of progressive disease was 49.0 %.

4381,"Stimulant and designer drug use: Primary care management.^
Approximately 10% of the U.S. population 12 years and older reported using illicit substances in 2015. This article reviews the clinical effects and treatment of persons who use cocaine, methamphetamines, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), synthetic cannabinoids, and synthetic cathinones (“bath salts”). Cocaine blocks the reuptake of the monoamine transporters dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. Immediate clinical effects include increased energy and euphoria, as well as hypertension and arrhythmias. Acute myocardial infarction, seizures, hallucinations, hyperthermia, and movement disorders are among the possible adverse effects. Like cocaine, methamphetamine blocks reuptake of monoamine transporters, but also stimulates dopamine release and has a longer duration of action. Methamphetamine misuse is associated with severe dental problems. MDMA is a stimulant and psychedelic with a chemical structure similar to serotonin. Adverse effects include serotonin syndrome, hyponatremia, long-term memory impairment, and mood disorders. Synthetic cannabinoids can have a more intense and long-lasting effect than natural cannabis. Acute intoxication may cause severe cardiac and respiratory complications and seizures. Synthetic cathinones are marketed as cheap substitutes for other stimulants. Their effects are similar to those of other stimulants, and they are addictive. Psychosocial intervention is the main form of treatment for addiction to these substances. Promising therapies include disulfiram and substitution therapy for cocaine misuse disorders, and mirtazapine for methamphetamine use disorder.",0,"[0.988513171672821, 0.01148683950304985]",0
7955,"Development of the Ketamine Side Effect Tool (KSET).^
BACKGROUND: Currently, no specific, systematic assessment tool for the monitoring and reporting of ketamine-related side effects exists. Our aim was to develop a comprehensive Ketamine Side Effect Tool (KSET) to capture acute and longer-term side effects associated with repeated ketamine treatments. METHODS: Informed by systematic review data and clinical research, we drafted a list of the most commonly reported side effects. Face and content validation were obtained via feedback from collaborators with expertise in psychiatry and anaesthetics, clinical trial piloting and a modified Delphi Technique involving ten international experts. RESULTS: The final version consisted of four forms that collect information at time points: screening, baseline, immediately after a single treatment, and longer-term follow-up. Instructions were developed to guide users and promote consistent utilisation. LIMITATIONS: Further evaluation of feasibility, construct validity and reliability is required, and is planned across multiple international sites. CONCLUSIONS: The structured Ketamine Side Effect Tool (KSET) was developed, with confirmation of content and face validity via a Delphi consensus process. This tool is timely, given the paucity of data regarding ketamine's safety, tolerability and abuse potential over the longer term, and its recent adoption internationally as a clinical treatment for depression. Although based on data from depression studies, the KSET has potential applicability for ketamine (or derivatives) used in other medical disorders, including chronic pain.

Background: There has been significant media interest in the use of novel psychoactive substances ('also known as') and reports in the medical literature of toxicity associated with their use. However, most surveys of recreational drug use focus on classical drugs such as cocaine and ecstasy, and there is limited information on how commonly emerging novel psychoactive substances are used.Aim: To collect data on use prevalence patterns of a wider range of novel psychoactive substances in South London gay nightclubs. Design: Questionnaire survey. Methods: Individuals attending gay-friendly nightclubs in South East London (July 2011) were asked about life-time use, last month use and/or use on the night of the survey/planned use later that night of novel psychoactive substances, cocaine and MDMA/ecstasy. Results: A total of 313 individuals were surveyed over 4 nights; 206 (65.8%;) had previously used a 'legal high'. Mephedrone had the highest prevalence of last month use (53.2%;) and use on the night of the survey (41.0%;). This was greater than both cocaine (44.6%; and 16.7%;, respectively) and MDMA/ecstasy (26.9%; and 5.8%;). There was limited on the night use of the non-mephedrone';: methoxetamine (1.6%;) and 1-benzylpiperazine (0.6%;), Spice/K2 (0.6%;) and pipradrols (0.6%;).Conclusions: Although a significant proportion of individuals report previous use of novel psychoactive substances, it seems that only mephedrone has become an established part of the recreational drug scene. It is important that there is a considered approach to determining the utilization of drug prevention/education and enforcement budgets to ensure that this is appropriately targeted to drugs that are used recreationally. © The Author 2012.

6062,"Intrathecal Ketamine, Dexmedetomidine and Both With Bupivacaine for Postoperative Abdominal Cancer Surgery Pain.^
This study was approved by the ethics committee of South Egypt Cancer Institute, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt. After obtaining a written informed consent, 90 American Society of Anesthesia (ASA) I‐II patients aged 30‐50 years and scheduled for major abdominal cancer surgery were included in the study. Patients with a known allergy to the study drugs, significant cardiac, respiratory, renal or hepatic disease, coagulation disorder, infection at the site of intrathecal injection, drug or alcohol abuse, BMI > 30 kg/m2 , and psychiatric illnesses that would interfere with perception and assessment of pain were excluded from the study. Preoperatively, patients were taught how to evaluate their own pain intensity using the visual analogue scale (VAS), scored from 0 ‐10 (where 0 = no pain, and 10 = the worst pain imaginable). Oral diazepam (5 mg) was taken the night before surgery. Up on arrival at the operative theatre, a 16‐gauge catheter was introduced intravenously at the dorsum of the hand; lactated Ringer's solution 10 mg/kg was infused intravenously over 10 min. before initiation of spinal anesthesia. Basic monitoring probes (electrocardiography, non invasive blood pressure, O2 saturation, and temperature) were applied. Patients were placed in the setting position and a 25‐gauge Quincke needle was placed in the L2‐3 or L3‐4 interspaces. Patients were randomly divided, by selecting sealed envelopes into one of three groups 30 patients each: ‐ The dexmedetomidine group (group I) received 10 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% in 2 ml volume and 5µg of dexmedetomidine in 1 ml volume intrathecally. ‐ The ketamine group (group II) received 10 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% in 2 ml volume and 0.1 mg/kg ketamine in 1ml volume intrathecally. ‐ Dexmedetomidine + Ketamine group (group III) received 10 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% in 2 ml volume and 5µg of dexmedetomidine plus 0.1 mg/kg of Ketamine in 1 ml volume intrathecally. Immediately after their intrathecal injection, the patients were placed in the supine position. After successful spinal anesthesia, general anesthesia was induced with fentanyl 1.5‐2 µg/kg, propofol 2‐3 mg/kg, and lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg. Endotracheal intubation was facilitated by cis‐atracurium 0.15 mg/kg. Heart rate, systolic, and diastolic blood pressure were recorded at 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 120, 180 minutes. Anesthesia and muscle relaxation were maintained by isoflurane 1‐ 1.5 MAC in 50% oxygen/air mixture and cis‐atracurium 0.03 mg/kg bolus given every 30 min. respectively. At the end of surgery, muscle relaxation was reversed by neostigmine 50 µg/kg and atropine 20 µg/kg. Patients were extubated and transferred to postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and were monitored for vital signs (heart rate, non invasive blood pressure, respiratory rate, and O2 saturation) immediately postoperative and at 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours postoperative. VAS scores were assessed at the same time points. Rescue analgesia represented by patient‐controlled analgesia (PCA) with intravenous morphine with an initial bolus of 0.1 mg/kg once pain was expressed by the patient, or if VAS was 3 or more (VAS ≥ 3) followed by 1 mg boluses with a lockout period of 5 min. The time of first request of analgesia and total analgesic consumption in the first 24 hours postoperatively were recorded. The patient's level of sedation was assessed at the same time points using a modified Observer's Assessment of alertness/sedation (OAAS) scale (where 6 = agitated, and 0 = doesn't respond to deep stimuls). The attendant anesthesiologist, the patient‐care giver, and the data collection personnel were all blinded to patient assignment to a specific group. Postoperative adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, hypotension, bradycardia, cardiac arrhythmias were recorded and treated. Hypotension was defined as a 15% decrease in systolic blood pressure from baseline. Bradycardia was defined as a heart rate slower than 50 beats per minute or a decrease in heart rate of 20% or more from baseline; whichev r is lowest. Hypoxia was defined as an oxygen saturation of less than 90%.

1385,"A cluster randomised controlled trial of the Climate Schools: Ecstasy and Emerging Drugs Module in Australian secondary schools: study protocol.^
BACKGROUND: The use of ecstasy is a public health problem and is associated with a range of social costs and harms. In recent years, there has been growing concern about the availability and misuse of new and emerging drugs designed to mimic the effects of illicit drugs, including ecstasy. This, coupled with the fact that the age of use and the risk factors for using ecstasy and emerging drugs are similar, provides a compelling argument to implement prevention for these substances simultaneously. The proposed study will evaluate whether a universal Internet-based prevention program, known as the Climate Schools: Ecstasy and Emerging Drugs Module, can address and prevent the use of ecstasy and emerging drugs among adolescents. METHODS: A cluster randomised controlled trial will be conducted among Year 10 students (aged 15-16 years) from 12 secondary schools in Sydney, Australia. Schools will be randomly assigned to either the Climate Schools intervention group or the control group. All students will complete a self-report questionnaire at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and 6-, 12- and 24-months post-baseline. The primary outcome measures will include ecstasy and emerging drug-related knowledge, intentions to use these substances in the future, and the patterns of use of ecstasy and emerging drugs. A range of secondary outcomes will also be assessed, including beliefs and attitudes about ecstasy and emerging drugs, peer pressure resistance, other substance use and mental health outcomes. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this will be the first evaluation of an Internet-based program designed to specifically target ecstasy and NED use among adolescents. If deemed effective, the Climate Schools: Ecstasy and Emerging Drugs Module will provide schools with an interactive and novel prevention program for ecstasy and emerging drugs that can be readily implemented by teachers.

Background: Life-threatening and fatal hyponatraemic complications following ecstasy use have previously been documented. Aim: To define clinical features of hyponatraemia following the ingestion of 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy'). Design: Retrospective case series. Methods: All enquiries to the London centre of the National Poisons Information Service (NPIS) between December 1993 and March 1996 were screened for cases of MDMA use associated with hyponatraemia (serum sodium <130 mmol/l). History of fluid consumption, presenting features and subsequent clinical course were recorded. Results: Seventeen patients, aged 15-26 years, were identified. Serum sodium levels ranged between 107 mmol/l and 128 mmol/l. In six patients, biochemical results were consistent with inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Analytical confirmation of MDMA ingestion was obtained in 10 patients. Ten patients were known to have ingested a large amount of non-alcoholic or alcoholic fluid. The clinical pattern was remarkably uniform, with initial vomiting and disturbed behaviour, followed in 11 patients by seizures. Drowsiness, a mute state and disorientation were observed for up to 3 days. Two patients died; 14 made a complete recovery. Discussion: MDMA can cause life-threatening hyponatraemic encephalopathy when accompanied by excessive fluid ingestion. The mechanism involves inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone.",1,"[0.003086080774664879, 0.9969139099121094]",1
75,"Repeated ketamine infusions for antidepressant-resistant PTSD: Methods of a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial.^
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating disorder with limited medication treatment options. Recent reports have described the dearth of research on new drug development as a crisis in the pharmacotherapy of PTSD. There are only two PTSD medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and both are serotonergic antidepressants. Therefore, there is a tremendous need to identify more effective and more rapidly acting pharmacotherapies for PTSD that work through novel neural mechanisms. Pilot evidence and case reports provided preliminary evidence supporting the safety and utility of investigating the therapeutic effects of ketamine in PTSD. However, the efficacy of this drug for PTSD has not yet been tested in active duty military or veteran populations. Here, we report the design and methods of a study funded under the Consortium to Alleviate PTSD. The study is a multisite, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial to examine the dose-related efficacy of ketamine, as compared to placebo, in producing a rapid and sustained reduction in PTSD symptomatology in veterans and active duty military populations with antidepressant-resistant PTSD. Approximately 198 eligible participants who meet criteria for PTSD will be randomized to the study drug (i.e., ketamine 0.5 mg/kg, ketamine 0.2 mg/kg, or placebo). The study drug will be administered intravenously twice per week for 4 weeks, followed by a 4-week follow-up period.

N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists administered to healthy humans results in schizophrenia-like symptoms, which are thought in part to be related to glutamatergically altered electrophysiological connectivity in large-scale intrinsic functional brain networks. Here, we examine resting-state source electroencephalographic (EEG) connectivity within and between the default mode (DMN: for self-related cognitive activity) and salience networks (SN: for detection of salient stimuli in internal and external environments) in 21 healthy volunteers administered a subanesthetic dose of the dissociative anesthetic and NMDAR antagonist, ketamine. In addition to provoking symptoms of dissociation, which are thought to originate from an altered sense of self that is common to schizophrenia, ketamine induces frequency-dependent increases and decreases in connectivity within and between DMN and SN. These altered interactive network couplings together with emergent dissociative symptoms tentatively support an NMDAR-hypofunction hypothesis of disturbed electrophysiologic connectivity in schizophrenia.",1,"[0.004460699390619993, 0.9955392479896545]",1
3260,"A systematic review of ketamine for the treatment of depression among older adults.^
OBJECTIVE: To review the currently available data on the use of ketamine in the treatment of depression among older adults from randomized controlled studies. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trials. SETTING: Variable. PARTICIPANTS: 60 years and older with depression. INTERVENTION: Ketamine. MEASUREMENTS: Change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores. RESULTS: Two studies met the inclusion criteria. The first study showed a significant reduction in depression symptoms with use of repeated subcutaneous ketamine administration among older adults with depression. The second study failed to achieve significance on its primary outcome measure but did show a decrease in MADRS scores with intranasal ketamine along with a higher response and remission rates in esketamine group compared with the placebo group. The adverse effects from ketamine generally lasted only a few hours and abated spontaneously. No cognitive adverse effects were noted in either trial from the use of ketamine. CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence for use of ketamine among older adults with depression indicates some benefits with one positive and one negative trial. Although one of the trials did not achieve significance on the primary outcome measure, it still showed benefit of ketamine in reducing depressive symptoms. Ketamine was well tolerated in both studies with adverse effects being mild and transient.",1,"[0.0031533632427453995, 0.996846616268158]",1

Social stigma, legal sanctions and the associated lack of sampling frames create barriers to the probabilistic sampling of those engaged in a variety of behaviour, including illicit drug use. We used a novel sampling approach to recruit respondents into a longitudinal study examining amphetamine-type stimulant use. A young adult population was screened for lifetime drug use to create a sampling frame of amphetamine-type stimulant users and non-users. We posted 12,118 screening questionnaires to a random selection of young adults listed on the electoral roll for Brisbane and the Gold Coast, Australia (N=107,275). Using a small pre-paid incentive and intensive telephone and postal reminders we attained a screening response rate of 49.9%. Eligible amphetamine-type stimulant users (used ecstasy or methamphetamine⩾3 times in past 12 months) and non-users (never used ecstasy or methamphetamine) were identified by screening responses. About two-thirds of each selected group took part in the longitudinal study. Comparisons with large-scale population survey data suggest the sample was broadly representative of young adult amphetamine-type stimulant users in Australia.",0,"[0.9868153929710388, 0.013184637762606144]",0
7521,"Psilocybin administration to healthy participants: safety and feasibility in a placebo-controlled study.^
Background: Treatment‐resistant depression (TRD) remains a significant unmet medical need. From an antidepressant drug development perspective, interest has in recent years been directed at compounds with known pharmacology. Psilocybin belongs to a class of drugs referred to as psychedelics ('mindmanifesting'). Psilocybin was isolated from psilocybe mushrooms in 1957 and synthesised in 1958. It is believed that partial agonism at 5HT2A receptors is a key contributor to its biological effects. The compound was used in psychiatric research and psychodynamic orientated psychotherapy from the early 1960s until it became a Schedule 1 substance in the USA in 1970. In recent years, several small studies have shown indications of efficacy of psilocybin in depressive states related to cancer and in TRD. Psilocybin is now in clinical development for TRD in the USA, Canada and Europe. The first study in this clinical development program, reported here, evaluated safety and feasibility in healthy participants. It also explored simultaneous administration of psilocybin in healthy participants and facilitated experiential training of specialised therapists for subsequent studies. The study's primary objective was to assess the short‐term effects of psilocybin on emotional processing and cognitive function at Days 7 and 28; these results will be presented later, once all the data has been analysed. Methods: This was a phase 1, randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study to evaluate the effects of 10 mg and 25 mg psilocybin as compared to placebo, in healthy participants, conducted at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, London, UK. The following assessment tools were administered: Tellegen Absorption Scale (TAS), NEO‐Five Factor Inventory (NEO‐FFI), Symptom Checklist‐90 item (SCL‐90), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), Pictorial Empathy Test (PET), Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET), Social Value Orientation (SVO), Toronto Empathy Questionnaire (TEQ), Scale of Social Responsibility (SSR), Spatial Working Memory (SWM), Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVP), Paired Associates Learning (PAL). Results from these instruments will be presented later. The study planned to recruit 90 participants, aged 18 plus, with no prior psilocybin experience within 1 year of enrolment. Participants were enrolled in the study for 12 weeks following study drug administration. They completed baseline assessments 1 day prior to study drug administration, including assessments of emotional processing and cognitive function. During this visit, they also took part in a 2‐hour preparatory group session with the study psychiatrist, lead therapist and chaperones. On Day 0, participants stratified by sex and age (18‐35 years old; > 35 years old) were randomised to the study drug (placebo, 10 mg psilocybin, or 25 mg psilocybin, administered orally, in a 1:1:1 ratio.). The sessions lasted approximately 6 hours and were supported by a trained chaperone and were supervised by the study psychiatrist and a lead therapist. The study drug could be administered simultaneously to up to 6 participants. All participants were assessed for safety and asked to complete the PANAS and 5D‐Altered States of Consciousness questionnaire (5D‐ASC). After the acute effects of study drug administration had subsided, participants returned home, coming back to the clinic the next morning for safety assessments and a discussion about the subjective experience during the session, conducted by study therapists. Results: 89 participants were recruited, with first participant first visit date 17 August 2018 and last participant last visit date 19 July 2019. Four strata were populated, (males 18‐35) n = 24; (males 35+) n = 24; (females 18‐35) n = 23; (females 35+) n = 18. 38% of the participants had prior psilocybin experience. A total of 25 dosing sessions were completed, with up to 6 participants per session (2 sessions with 1 participant, 3 with 2 participants, 5 with 3 participants, 11 with 4, 2 with 5, and, 2 ith 6). In the simultaneous administration sessions, each participant was supported by an assisting therapist, overseen in the treatment room by a lead therapist. During this study, 46 therapists received experiential training for subsequent studies. Psilocybin induced expected transient psychedelic experiences. The drug was well tolerated and no serious adverse events were reported. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the safety and feasibility of psilocybin administration to healthy participants in a controlled setting with trained therapists. Additionally, simultaneous administration to up to 6 volunteers was shown to be feasible in this population.",1,"[0.002719647716730833, 0.9972803592681885]",1

Background: Psilocybin-containing mushrooms are used for recreational, spiritual, self-development and therapeutic purposes. However, physiologically relatively nontoxic, adverse reactions are occasionally reported. Aims: This study investigated the 12-month prevalence and nature of magic mushroom-related adverse reactions resulting in emergency medical treatment seeking in a global sample of people reporting magic mushroom use. Methods: We use data from the 2017 Global Drug Survey – a large anonymous online survey on patterns of drug use conducted between November 2016 and January 2017. Results: Out of 9233 past year magic mushroom users, 19 (0.2%) reported having sought emergency medical treatment, with a per-event risk estimate of 0.06%. Young age was the only predictor associated with higher risk of emergency medical presentations. The most common symptoms were psychological, namely anxiety/panic and paranoia/suspiciousness. Poor ‘mindset’, poor ‘setting’ and mixing substances were most reported reasons for incidents. All but one respondent returned back to normality within 24 h. Conclusions: The results confirm psilocybin mushrooms are a relatively safe drug, with serious incidents rare and short lasting. Providing harm-reduction information likely plays a key role in preventing adverse effects.

9308,"Self-reported psychopathology among young, low-income, female ecstasy users.^
This study examined the association of ecstasy (methylenedioxy- methylamphethamine) use with psychopathology among young, low-income females who sought care at university family planning clinics in Texas between December 2001 and May 2003. Participants reported drug use history and eight problem behavior syndromes by using the Young Adult Self-Report. The prevalence of ecstasy use was approximately 15%. About 90% of ecstasy users reported having used other drugs. Overall, ecstasy users were more likely to have exhibited delinquent behaviors and thought problems than exclusive marijuana users. Ecstasy users who continued to use any illicit drugs showed the most severe psychopathology. These findings indicate that elevated rates of self-reported psychopathology among ecstasy users may be partly attributable to the use of multiple drugs. Furthermore, it will also be important for future studies to assess the extent to which delinquent behaviors and thought problems mediate the transition of marijuana use to ecstasy use. © 2008 by The Haworth Press.

4059,"An online survey of tobacco smoking cessation associated with naturalistic psychedelic use.^
Data suggest psychedelics such as psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) may hold therapeutic potential in the treatment of addictions, including tobacco dependence. This retrospective cross-sectional anonymous online survey characterized 358 individuals (52 females) who reported having quit or reduced smoking after ingesting a psychedelic in a non-laboratory setting ≥1 year ago. On average, participants smoked 14 cigarettes/day for 8 years, and had five previous quit attempts before their psychedelic experience. Of the 358 participants, 38% reported continuous smoking cessation after psychedelic use (quitters). Among quitters, 74% reported >2 years' abstinence. Of the 358 participants, 28% reported a persisting reduction in smoking (reducers), from a mode of 300 cigarettes/month before, to a mode of 1 cigarette/month after the experience. Among reducers, 62% reported >2 years of reduced smoking. Finally, 34% of the 358 participants (relapsers) reported a temporary smoking reduction before returning to baseline smoking levels, with a mode time range to relapse of 3-6 months. Relapsers rated their psychedelic experience significantly lower in personal meaning and spiritual significance than both other groups. Participants across all groups reported less severe affective withdrawal symptoms (e.g. depression, craving) after psychedelic use compared with previous quit attempts, suggesting a potential mechanism of action for psychedelic-associated smoking cessation/reduction. Changes in life priorities/values were endorsed as the most important psychological factor associated with smoking cessation/reduction. Results suggest psychedelics may hold promise in treating tobacco addiction as potentially mediated by spiritual experience, changed priorities/values, and improved emotional regulation.",1,"[0.007510772906243801, 0.992489218711853]",1
4523,"Administration of ketamine for unipolar and bipolar depression.^
OBJECTIVE: Clinical trials demonstrated that ketamine exhibits rapid antidepressant efficacy when administered in subanaesthetic dosages. We reviewed currently available literature investigating efficacy, response rates and safety profile. METHODS: Twelve studies investigating unipolar, seven on bipolar depression were included after search in medline, scopus and web of science. RESULTS: Randomized, placebo-controlled or open-label trials reported antidepressant response rates after 24 h on primary outcome measures at 61%. The average reduction of Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) was 10.9 points, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) 15.7 points and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) 20.8 points. Ketamine was always superior to placebo. Most common side effects were dizziness, blurred vision, restlessness, nausea/vomiting and headache, which were all reversible. Relapse rates ranged between 60% and 92%. To provide best practice-based information to patients, a consent-form for application and modification in local language is included. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine constitutes a novel, rapid and efficacious treatment option for patients suffering from treatment resistant depression and exhibits rapid and significant anti-suicidal effects. New administration routes might serve as alternative to intravenous regimes for potential usage in outpatient settings. However, long-term side effects are not known and short duration of antidepressant response need ways to prolong ketamine's efficacy.",1,"[0.007287311367690563, 0.992712676525116]",1
8332,"Neural mechanisms underlying the rewarding and therapeutic effects of ketamine as a treatment for alcohol use disorder.^
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is the most prevalent substance use disorder and causes a significant global burden. Relapse rates remain incredibly high after decades of attempting to develop novel treatment options that have failed to produce increased rates of sobriety. Ketamine has emerged as a potential treatment for AUD following its success as a therapeutic agent for depression, demonstrated by several preclinical studies showing that acute administration reduced alcohol intake in rodents. As such, ketamine’s therapeutic effects for AUD are now being investigated in clinical trials with the hope of it being efficacious in prolonging sobriety from alcohol in humans (ClinicalTrials.gov, Identifier: NCT01558063). Importantly, ketamine’s antidepressant effects only last for about 1-week and because AUD is a lifelong disorder, repeated treatment regimens would be necessary to maintain sobriety. This raises questions regarding its safety for AUD treatment since ketamine itself has the potential for addiction. Therefore, this review aims to summarize the neuroadaptations related to alcohol’s addictive properties as well as ketamine’s therapeutic and addictive properties. To do this, the focus will be on reward-related brain regions such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc), dorsal striatum, prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus, and ventral tegmental area (VTA) to understand how acute vs. chronic exposure will alter reward signaling over time. Additionally, evidence from these studies will be summarized in both male and female subjects. Accordingly, this review aims to address the safety of repeated ketamine infusions for the treatment of AUD. Although more work about the safety of ketamine to treat AUD is warranted, we hope this review sheds light on some answers about the safety of repeated ketamine infusions.

The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine has rapid onset activity in treatment-resistant depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. Due to similarities in brain network activity in depression and anxiety disorders, we hypothesized that ketamine might also be active in other refractory anxiety disorders. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of ketamine in 12 patients with refractory generalized anxiety disorder and/or social anxiety disorder who were not currently depressed, using an ascending single dose study design (0.25, 0.5, 1 mg/kg administered subcutaneously) at weekly intervals. Within 1 h of dosing, patients reported reduced anxiety, which persisted for up to seven days. A dose-response profile was noted for anxiolytic effects, dissociative side effects, and changes in blood pressure and heart rate, with minor changes at 0.25 mg/kg, and progressively greater and more durable changes at the higher doses. Ten of 12 patients were treatment responders at 0.5-1 mg/kg. Ketamine was safe and well tolerated in this population. Ketamine may be a potential therapeutic alternative for patients with refractory generalized anxiety disorder/social anxiety disorder. Along with its demonstrated effectiveness in patients with treatment-resistant depression, obsessive compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, these data raise the intriguing possibility that ketamine may have broad efficacy in disorders characterized by negative emotional states, and that these disorders may share a common precipitating neurobiology.",1,"[0.004403431434184313, 0.9955965876579285]",1
1538,"(±) ketamine-induced prepulse inhibition deficits of an acoustic startle response in rats are not reversed by antipsychotics.^
Prepulse inhibition (PPI) is the reduction in the startle response caused by a low intensity non-startling stimulus (the prepulse) which is presented shortly before the startle stimulus and is an operational measure of sensorimotor gating. PPI is impaired in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. Ketamine, a non-competitive N-methyt-D-aspartate antagonist has been shown to induce schizophrenia-like behavioural changes in humans and PPI deficits in rats, which can be reversed by antipsychotics. Thus, ketamine-induced PPI deficits in rats may provide a translational model of schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of antipsychotic drugs and drugs known to after the glutamate system upon ketamine-induced PPI deficits in rats. Rats were habituated to the PPI procedure [randomized trials of either pulse alone (110 dB/50 ms) or prepulse + pulse (80 dB/10 ms)]. Animals were assigned to pre-treatments based on the level of PPI on the last habituation test and balanced across startle chambers. Ketamine (1-10 mg/kg s.c; 15 min ptt) increased startle amplitude and induced PPI deficits at 6 and 10 mg/kg. PPI deficits induced by ketamine at 6 mg/kg were not attenuated by clozapine (2.5-10 mg/kg s.c.; 60 min ptt), risperidone (0.1-1 mg/kg i.p..; 60 min ptt), haloperidol (0.1-1 mg/kg i.p.; 60 min ptt), lamotrigine (3-30 mg/kg p.o.; 60 min ptt), or SB-271046-A (5-20 mg/kg p.o.; 2 hour ptt) nor potentiated by 2-methyt-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (3-10mg/kg i.p.; 30 min ptt). These results suggest that under these test conditions ketamine-induced PPI deficits in rats is relatively insensitive and does not represent a translational model for drug discovery in schizophrenia.",0,"[0.9934735894203186, 0.0065264091826975346]",0
8551,"Psychedelics alter metaphysical beliefs.^
Can the use of psychedelic drugs induce lasting changes in metaphysical beliefs? While it is popularly believed that they can, this question has never been formally tested. Here we exploited a large sample derived from prospective online surveying to determine whether and how beliefs concerning the nature of reality, consciousness, and free-will, change after psychedelic use. Results revealed significant shifts away from 'physicalist' or 'materialist' views, and towards panpsychism and fatalism, post use. With the exception of fatalism, these changes endured for at least 6 months, and were positively correlated with the extent of past psychedelic-use and improved mental-health outcomes. Path modelling suggested that the belief-shifts were moderated by impressionability at baseline and mediated by perceived emotional synchrony with others during the psychedelic experience. The observed belief-shifts post-psychedelic-use were consolidated by data from an independent controlled clinical trial. Together, these findings imply that psychedelic-use may causally influence metaphysical beliefs-shifting them away from 'hard materialism'.

Enhancing glutamate function by stimulating the glycine site of the NMDA receptor with glycine, D-serine, or with drugs that inhibit glycine reuptake may have therapeutic potential in schizophrenia. The effects of a single oral dose of cis-N-methyl-N-(6-methoxy-1-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ylmethyl) amino-methylcarboxylic acid hydrochloride (Org 25935), a glycine transporter-1 (GlyT1) inhibitor, and placebo pretreatment on ketamine-induced schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms, perceptual alterations, and subjective effects were evaluated in 12 healthy male subjects in a randomized, counter-balanced, within-subjects, crossover design. At 2.5 h after administration of the Org 25935 or placebo, subjects received a ketamine bolus and constant infusion lasting 100 min. Psychotic symptoms, perceptual, and a number of subjective effects were assessed repeatedly before, several times during, and after completion of ketamine administration. A cognitive battery was administered once per test day. Ketamine produced behavioral, subjective, and cognitive effects consistent with its known effects. Org 25935 reduced the ketamine-induced increases in measures of psychosis (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)) and perceptual alterations (Clinician Administered Dissociative Symptoms Scale (CADSS)). The magnitude of the effect of Org 25935 on ketamine-induced increases in Total PANSS and CADSS Clinician-rated scores was 0.71 and 0.98 (SD units), respectively.

6568,"Reactivations after 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine use in naturalistic settings: An initial exploratory analysis of the phenomenon’s predictors and its emotional valence.^
Background: The psychedelic 5-MeO-DMT has shown clinical potential due to its short duration and ability to induce mystical experiences. However, a phenomenon known as “reactivations” (similar to “flashbacks”) is a poorly understood and frequently reported phenomenon which appears associated with 5-MeO-DMT use and warranted further investigation. Aims: This study examined whether differences in age, gender, education, lifetime use, use location, and preparation strategies predict reactivations (primary outcome). Additionally, we explored how reactivations were perceived by survey respondents and whether demographic data predicted emotional valence (secondary outcome) of reported reactivations. Materials and methods: This study used secondary quantitative data from a survey assessing epidemiological and behavioral associations of 5-MeO-DMT use in non-clinical settings (N = 513). Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, t-tests, and logistic regressions were utilized to explore aims. Results: Being female, older at the time of first 5-MeO-DMT dose, having higher educational attainment, and dosing in a structured group setting were associated with increased odds of reporting a reactivation event. Higher mystical experience scores, greater personal wellbeing and having had a non-dual awareness experience that was not substance-induced were associated with higher likelihood of reporting a neutral or positive emotional valence of a reactivation event. Conclusion: These findings suggest that reactivation phenomena, in this particular sample may most often represent a neutral or positive byproduct of the acute 5-MeO-DMT experience. More information is needed to best identify individuals most likely to experience a reactivation as a negative event to prevent such potential challenging outcomes.",1,"[0.00345578882843256, 0.9965441823005676]",1

INTRODUCTION: Major depressive disorder (MDD) in people with advanced life-limiting illnesses can have significant impact on the quality-of-life of those affected. The management of MDD in the palliative care setting can be challenging as typical antidepressants may not work in time nor be tolerated due to coexisting organ dysfunctions, symptom burden and frailty. Parenteral ketamine was found to exhibit effective and rapid-onset antidepressant effect even against treatment-resistant depression in the psychiatric population. However, there is currently neither feasibility study nor available prospective study available to inform of the safety, tolerability and efficacy of such for MDD in the palliative setting. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is an open-labelled, single arm, phase II pilot feasibility study involving adult patients with advanced life-limiting illnesses and MDD across four palliative care services in Australia. It has an individual dose-titration design (0.1-0.4 mg/kg) with weekly treatments of subcutaneous ketamine infusion over 2 hours. The primary outcome is feasibility. The secondary outcomes are related to the safety, tolerability and antidepressant efficacy of ketamine, participants' satisfaction in relation to the trial process and the reasons for not completing the study at various stages. The feasibility data will be reported using descriptive statistics. Meanwhile, side effects, tolerability and efficacy data will be analysed using change of assessment scores from baseline.

Psilocybin can occasion mystical-type experiences with participant-attributed increases in well-being. However, little research has examined enduring changes in traits. This study administered psilocybin to participants who undertook a program of meditation/spiritual practices. Healthy participants were randomized to three groups (25 each): (1) very low-dose (1 mg/70 kg on sessions 1 and 2) with moderate-level (""standard"") support for spiritual-practice (LD-SS); (2) high-dose (20 and 30 mg/70 kg on sessions 1 and 2, respectively) with standard support (HD-SS); and (3) high-dose (20 and 30 mg/70kg on sessions 1 and 2, respectively) with high support for spiritual practice (HD-HS). Psilocybin was administered double-blind and instructions to participants/staff minimized expectancy confounds. Psilocybin was administered 1 and 2 months after spiritual-practice initiation. Outcomes at 6 months included rates of spiritual practice and persisting effects of psilocybin. Compared with low-dose, high-dose psilocybin produced greater acute and persisting effects. At 6 months, compared with LD-SS, both high-dose groups showed large significant positive changes on longitudinal measures of interpersonal closeness, gratitude, life meaning/purpose, forgiveness, death transcendence, daily spiritual experiences, religious faith and coping, and community observer ratings.

8156,"Four weekly ayahuasca sessions lead to increases in ""acceptance"" capacities: A comparison study with a standard 8-week mindfulness training program.^
Background: The therapeutic effects of the Amazonian plant tea ayahuasca may relate to its ability to enhance mindfulness capacities. Ayahuasca induces a modified state of awareness through the combined action of its active principles: the psychedelic N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and a series of centrally acting ß-carbolines, mainly harmine and tetrahydroharmine. To better understand the therapeutic potential of ayahuasca, here we compared the impact on mindfulness capacities induced by two independent interventions: (a) participation in four ayahuasca sessions without any specific purpose related to improving mindfulness capacities; and (b) participation in a standard mindfulness training course: 8 weeks mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), with the specific goal of improving these skills. Methods: Participants of two independent groups completed two self-report instruments: The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) and the Experiences Questionnaire (EQ). The MINDSENS Composite Index was also calculated, including those EQ and FFMQ items that have proven to be the most sensitive to meditation practice. Group A (n = 10) was assessed before and after the last of four closely spaced consecutive ayahuasca sessions. Group B (n = 10) was assessed before and after completion of a standard 8-week MBSR course. Results: MBSR training led to greater increases in overall mindfulness scores after the 8-week period. MBSR but not ayahuasca led to increases in the MINDSENS Composite Index. However, the ayahuasca sessions induced comparable increases in the Non-Judging subscale of the FFMQ, specifically measuring ""acceptance."" Improving this capacity allows for a more detached and less judgmental stance toward potentially distressing thoughts and emotions. Conclusion: The present findings suggest that a small number of ayahuasca sessions can be as effective at improving acceptance as more lengthy and costly interventions. Future studies should address the benefits of combining ayahuasca administration with mindfulness-based interventions. This will allow us to investigate if ayahuasca will improve the outcome of psychotherapeutic interventions.",1,"[0.004815446678549051, 0.995184600353241]",1

A number of drugs that fall into the broad category of ""ring-substituted amphetamines"" have been found to be neurotoxic toward brain monoamine neurons in animals. Several of these drugs, including (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""Ecstasy"") and methamphetamine (""speed"") and fenfluramine (""Pondimin"") have been used or abused by humans. A growing body of evidence indicates that humans, like animals, are susceptible to substituted amphetamine-induced neurotoxic injury, and that consequences of this injury can be subtle. This article will review the effects of ring-substituted amphetamine analogs on brain monoamine neurons, using MDMA as the prototype. Studies documenting MDMA neurotoxic potential toward brain serotonin (5-HT) neurons in animals are summarized first. Human MDMA studies are then discussed, beginning with a consideration of methodological challenges in evaluating the status of 5-HT neurons in the living human brain. Recent findings indicating possible functional alterations in brain serotonergic systems in humans with a history of extensive MDMA exposure are then presented, including some new findings on sleep and personality in abstinent MDMA users.",0,"[0.9939844012260437, 0.00601566769182682]",0
1524,"MDMA-assisted therapy is associated with a reduction in chronic pain among people with post-traumatic stress disorder.^
INTRODUCTION: Increasing evidence demonstrates 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted therapy (MDMA-AT) may be a safe and effective treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). There is growing interest in MDMA-AT to address a range of other health challenges. Chronic pain and PTSD are frequently comorbid, reciprocally interdependent conditions, though the possible role of MDMA-AT in treating chronic pain remains under-investigated. The present analysis examined the impact of manualized MDMA-AT on chronic pain severity among participants with PTSD who were enrolled in a Phase 2 clinical trial investigating MDMA-AT for PTSD (NCT03282123). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Exploratory data from a subset of participants who completed chronic pain measures (n = 32) were drawn from a Phase 2 open-label study sponsored by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS). Multivariable analysis of variance (ANOVA) was utilized to compare pre- vs. post-treatment Chronic Pain Grade Scale (CPGS) values, adjusting for demographics (age, sex, and ethnicity). K-means clustering was then used to group the sample into three clusters to denote high (n = 9), medium (n = 11), and low (n = 12) baseline pain severity, and the same analysis was repeated for each cluster. RESULTS: Among the 32 participants included in this analysis, 59% (n = 19) were women, 72% (n = 23) were white, and median age was 38 years [interquartile range (IQR) = 31-47]. Overall, 84% (n = 27) reported having pain, and 75% (n = 24) reported disability associated with their pain. Significant reductions in CPGS subscales for pain intensity and disability score, and overall CPGS severity grade were observed among participants in the highest pain cluster (n = 9, p < 0.05), and for pain intensity in the medium pain cluster (n = 11, p < 0.05) post- vs. pre-treatment. DISCUSSION: Findings demonstrate a high prevalence of chronic pain in this sample of people with severe PTSD and that chronic pain scores among medium and high pain subgroups were significantly lower following MDMA-AT. While these data are preliminary, when considered alongside the frequency of comorbid chronic pain and PTSD and promising efficacy of MDMA-AT for treating PTSD, these findings encourage further research exploring the role of MDMA-AT for chronic pain.",1,"[0.004012121818959713, 0.9959878325462341]",1
6247,"The Effect of LSD on Neural Synchrony, Prosocial Behavior, and Relationship Quality.^
Evidence is growing that psychedelic substances such as psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and ayahuasca could be a potential alternative treatment option for common and difficult to treat psychiatric conditions. One proposed mechanism that psychedelics target, which is a hallmark of seemingly all psychiatric disorders, are deficits in social cognitive abilities. However, the neural underpinnings of psychedelic induced alterations in prosocial behavior are currently unknown. The investigators hypothesize psychedelics increase such prosocial behaviors by increasing neural synchrony, which is the coupling of brain‐to‐brain activity across two or more people; it has been found to underlie social connection and various forms of shared prosocial behavior. The current project will primarily assess whether LSD enhances neural synchrony between romantic partners. Second, the investigators will assess whether LSD enhances prosocial behavior between members of a dyad, thus replicating previous studies which assessed prosocial behavior within one individual at a time. The investigators will also assess the relationship between neural synchrony and outcome variables of the prosocial behaviour tasks. Lastly, it will be assessed whether LSD‐induced changes in neural synchrony and/or prosocial behaviour affect persisting relationship quality. Oxytocin and cytokine concentrations, will also be quantified to investigate whether there is a relationship between these factors and changes in prosocial behaviour. The study design will be conducted according to a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, 2‐way crossover design. Healthy participants (N=60) who are in a relationship (N=30 couples) will receive placebo and an oral dose of 50 µg of LSD. Between each condition, there will be a minimum of 14 days washout. This leads to a total study duration of minimally four weeks, for a participant to go through the medical examination and both drug conditions.",1,"[0.002947595901787281, 0.9970524311065674]",1
1389,"Is Ketamine the Future Clozapine for Depression? A Case Series and Literature Review on Maintenance Ketamine in Treatment-resistant Depression With Suicidal Behavior.^
Ketamine has shown effectiveness as a rapid-acting antidepressant with antisuicidal effects in terms of reduction of suicidal ideation in the short term. However, the evidence for long-term maintenance ketamine therapy for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and suicidal behavior is limited. This case series (N=13) highlights the role of adjunctive serial maintenance ketamine infusions in restoring functionality in treatment-resistant unipolar and bipolar (mixed) depression with significant suicide risk and multiple comorbidities, including alcohol dependence. Two cases of TRD achieved functional remission with long-term maintenance ketamine treatment. The first case illustrates the potential synergistic interaction between ketamine and lamotrigine to achieve a sustained antidepressant response in the patient for 7 months. The second case may possibly be the longest reported case of maintenance ketamine therapy, with treatment continuing for 5 years to date. Ketamine treatment showed acute effectiveness in another 7 cases, especially in terms of reduction of suicidal ideation, albeit without significant long-term antidepressant effect. Factors that may contribute to lack of effectiveness of serial ketamine include inadequate mood stabilization in TRD in bipolar spectrum diagnoses, concomitant benzodiazepine use, complex comorbidities, and adverse effects such as significant hypertension and severe dissociation. Future systematic controlled studies are warranted to establish the efficacy and safety profile of long-term ketamine as maintenance therapy for TRD with suicidal behavior.",1,"[0.006757466122508049, 0.9932425618171692]",1
7366,"Perceived harm, motivations for use and subjective experiences of recreational psychedelic ‘magic’ mushroom use.^
Background: Data on actual harm of magic mushrooms suggest that toxicity and abuse potential is low, however, their legal status suggests otherwise. We aimed to gauge perception of harm of magic mushrooms in both users and mushroom-naïve participants. We also aimed to observe differences in expectations of effects between users and mushroom-naïve participants, and whether motivations for use predicted their expected effects. Method: In total, 73 polydrug users with experience of using magic mushrooms and 78 mushroom-naïve participants completed an online survey. We asked participants to rank a list of 10 substances from most dangerous to least dangerous and questioned them about expectation of effect using a modified magic mushroom expectation questionnaire. Users were asked about their motivations for using magic mushrooms. Results: Both groups perceive mushrooms to be safer than heroin, cocaine, prescription painkillers, gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), ecstasy, tobacco and alcohol. However, the mushroom-naïve group ranked mushrooms as significantly more dangerous than the user group. Non-users reported greater expectancy for negative intoxication. Users reported greater expected entactogenic, prosocial, aesthetic and mood effects, and perceptual alterations. Finally, expectant effects of mushroom use were associated with different motivations for use, for example using for personal psychotherapy was associated with expectation of increased entactogenic effects and decreased negative effects. Conclusion: Our data suggest a general perception of harm that is in line with data on actual harm, but at odds with current legal classifications. Future clinical investigations may require management of negative intoxication expectation of participants with no prior experience of psilocybin.",1,"[0.009607418440282345, 0.9903925657272339]",1

The drug 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""ecstasy"", ""molly"") is a widely used illicit drug and experimental adjunct to psychotherapy. MDMA has unusual, poorly understood socioemotional effects, including feelings of interpersonal closeness and sociability. To better understand these effects, we conducted a small (n=12) within-subjects double-blind placebo controlled study of the effects of 1.5 mg/kg oral MDMA on social emotions and autobiographical disclosure in a controlled setting. MDMA displayed both sedative- and stimulant-like effects, including increased self-report anxiety. At the same time, MDMA positively altered evaluation of the self (i.e. increasing feelings of authenticity) while decreasing concerns about negative evaluation by others (i.e. decreasing social anxiety). Consistent with these feelings, MDMA increased how comfortable participants felt describing emotional memories. Overall, MDMA produced a prosocial syndrome that seemed to facilitate emotional disclosure and that appears consistent with the suggestion that it represents a novel pharmacological class.",1,"[0.0030205431394279003, 0.9969794750213623]",1
5047,"Baseline insomnia as a predictor of antidepressant efficacy to repeated intravenous ketamine for unipolar and bipolar depression: A preliminary study.^
OBJECTIVE: Ketamine has been demonstrated to have robust and rapid antidepressant effects, and few studies have focused on the relationship between insomnia and the efficacy of ketamine. The objective of this study was to examine whether baseline insomnia predicted the antidepressant efficacy of repeated intravenous ketamine infusions for unipolar and bipolar depression. METHOD: Patients with high insomnia (n = 64) or low insomnia (n = 68) received six intravenous infusions of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min) over 12 days (Monday-Wednesday-Friday). The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) without sleep item was used to assess depressive symptoms. Response was defined as a MADRS total score ≥ 50%, and remission was defined as a MADRS total score ≤ 10. RESULT: There were no differences in response or remission rates between patients with high and low insomnia. However, the logistic regression model showed that high insomnia predicted an increased likelihood of response and remission. Cox proportional hazards models showed a reduced latency to respond and remit in patients with high insomnia. A linear mixed model showed that the high insomnia subgroup had greater improvement than the low insomnia subgroup (all p < 0.05). LIMITATION: The major limitation of this study is the open-label design. CONCLUSION: When given six ketamine infusions, patients with high insomnia were more likely to respond and remit than those with low insomnia. Patients with high insomnia showed not only a shorter latency to respond and remit, but also greater improvement than those with low insomnia.",1,"[0.002654412528499961, 0.9973456263542175]",1

MDMA-induced impairments of memory performance have been reported in different human and animal studies. However, the correlation between spatial memory impairment, brain mitochondrial function, and concentrations of MDMA and its metabolites has not yet been investigated despite it being needed for comparison with human studies. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the dose concentration and spatial memory as well as brain mitochondrial function association after MDMA administration in rats. We assessed the effects of MDMA [0.5, 2.5, 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg; intraperitoneally (I.P)] on spatial memory of male Wistar rats in the Morris water maze test (MWM) and brain mitochondrial function (i.e., reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial membrane potential, swelling and outer membrane damage, cytochrome c release, and ADP/ATP ratio). Concentrations of MDMA and its metabolite, MDA, were determined in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain which was obtained immediately after probe test of MWM (i.e., 4 h after last training trial). The results of this study indicate nonlinear kinetics of MDMA after I.P adminstration. Also, an insignificant correlation was observed between MDMA doses and the MDA/MDMA ratio in plasma, CSF, and brain. Moreover, the results showed that MDMA, but not MDA, accumulated in brain tissue by increasing the administered doses. Beside, MDMA-induced impairments of spatial memory and brain mitochondrial function were significantly correlated with the concentrations of both MDMA and MDA in plasma, CSF, and brain. Therefore, it can be suggested that MDMA and its metabolite, MDA, affect spatial memory and brain mitochondrial function.",0,"[0.992363452911377, 0.007636527065187693]",0

Clinical impressions and data from a limited number of studies suggest that membership in certain groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous may promote well-being and abstinence from alcohol and drugs. The present study examines measures of religiosity and drug/alcohol consumption in an inpatient psychiatric population in order to test the possible association between these variables. One hundred sixty-eight adult admissions to a private psychiatric hospital were asked to complete the Religious Involvement Questionnaire (RIQ), a self-report instrument containing validated measures of intrinsic and extrinsic religiosity. Responses of general adult psychiatric patients (N = 103) were compared with those of patients admitted to a chemical dependence unit (N = 65). Correlations between alcohol/drug use and RIQ responses were measured for the entire sample. Patients admitted for chemical dependence were significantly less likely than general adult psychiatry patients to avoid certain food/music/drink because of their religion, and were less likely to help with the running of their church. Measures of alcohol, hallucinogen, and prescription drug consumption had significant negative correlations with religiosity scores. Chemically dependent patients differ from psychiatric patients with other diagnoses on measures of religiosity.

BACKGROUND: Drug induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) has emerged as a promising tool for customizing the adequate surgical approach to relieve airway obstruction in sleep apnea patients. We aimed to compare propofol, dexmedetomidine or ketofol with regards their efficacy and safety for sedation in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) undergoing DISE procedure. METHODS: Sixty adult OSA patients scheduled for DISE procedure were randomly allocated into three equal groups to receive either propofol (group P), dexmedetomidine (group D), or ketofol (group K). Incidence of oxygen desaturation <90%, hemodynamic variables, time to achieve sufficient sedation level, recovery time, patients' and endoscopists' satisfaction, and incidence of adverse effects were recorded. RESULTS: Higher incidence of oxygen desaturation <90% was observed in group P as compared to groups D and K (70%, 35%, and 30% respectively, P=0.021*). Group D showed a significantly longer time to reach target sedation level, prolonged recovery time with more consumption of rescue propofol as compared to group P and group K (P=0.000*, 0.000*, 0.000* respectively). Heart rate values were lower in group D after the loading dose till 30 min postoperative as compared to the other two groups, while blood pressure was lower in both P and D groups at five, 10, 15 min, and on reaching recovery room compared to K group. Two patients in the K group had psychomimetic symptoms with no difference between groups as regards other adverse events or patients' and endoscopist's satisfactions.

Results: B(max) for paroxetine binding before light treatment was higher in SAD patients compared to controls and also higher in responders than in nonresponders. B(max) decreased significantly during light treatment. We also found a negative correlation between the two B(max) values before but not after light treatment. There was a negative correlation between B(max) for paroxetine binding before treatment and clinical status after treatment.

1758,"A Large-Scale Naturalistic Examination of the Acute Effects of Cannabis on Pain.^
Introduction: Cannabis use for pain relief is commonly reported, yet laboratory studies and clinical trials suggest that cannabinoids are weak analgesics, and it is unclear whether perceived reductions in pain from before to after cannabis use relate to factors such as dose, method of administration, phytocannabinoid content, or the age or gender of the user. We determined whether inhalation of cannabis decreased self-reported pain ratings as well as whether user gender, age, time, method of administration, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)/cannabidiol (CBD) content, or dose of cannabis contribute to changes in these ratings. We also examined whether tolerance may develop to the analgesic effects of cannabis over time. Materials and Methods: Archival data were obtained from Strainprint(®), a medical cannabis app that allows patients to track symptoms before and after using different strains and doses of cannabis. Latent change score models and multilevel models were used to analyze data from 131,582 sessions in which inhaled cannabis was used to treat ""muscle pain,"" ""joint pain,"" or ""nerve pain."" Results: For all three pain symptoms, severity ratings decreased significantly after cannabis use. Women reported higher baseline and postcannabis pain severity than did men, and men reported larger decreases in pain than did women. Neither THC nor CBD content nor their interaction predicted reductions in pain ratings. However, vaping was associated with larger reductions in joint pain ratings than was smoking, and lower doses were associated with larger reductions in nerve pain ratings. Additionally, for all three pain symptoms, the dose of cannabis used to manage pain increased significantly over time. Conclusions: Inhaled cannabis reduces self-reported pain severity by ∼42-49%. However, these reductions appear to diminish across time, and patients use larger doses across time, suggesting that analgesic tolerance develops with continued use.",0,"[0.9783785343170166, 0.021621497347950935]",0
7036,"The effects of Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD) on the Positive Valence Systems: A Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)-Informed Systematic Review.^
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The renewed interest in psychedelic research provides growing evidence of potentially unique effects on various aspects of reward processing systems. Using the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework, as proposed by the National Institute of Mental Health, we aim to synthesize the existing literature concerning the impact of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) on the RDoC's Positive Valence Systems (PVS) domain, and to identify potential avenues for further research. METHODS: Two LSD-related terms (lysergic acid diethylamide and LSD) and 13 PVS-related terms (reward, happiness, bliss, motivation, reinforcement learning, operant, conditioning, satisfaction, decision making, habit, valence, affect, mood) were used to search electronic databases such as PubMed, Scopus, PsychINFO, and Web of Science for relevant articles. A manual search of the reference list resulted in nine additional articles. After screening, articles and data were evaluated and included based on their relevance to the objective of investigating the effects of LSD on the PVS. Articles and data were excluded if they did not provide information about the PVS, were observational in nature, lacked comparators or reference groups, or were duplicates. A risk of bias assessment was performed using the National Toxicology Program's Office of Health Assessment and Translation (NTP OHAT) risk of bias (RoB) tool. Data from the included articles were collected and structured based on the RDoC bio-behavioral matrix, specifically focusing on the PVS domain and its three constituent constructs: reward responsiveness, reward learning, and reward valuation. RESULTS: We reviewed 28 clinical studies with 477 participants. Lysergic acid diethylamide, assessed at self-report (23 studies), molecular (5 studies), circuit (4 studies), and paradigm (3 studies) levels, exhibited dose-dependent mood improvement (20 short-term and 3 long-term studies). The subjective and neural effects of LSD were linked to the 5-HT(2A) receptor (molecular). Animal studies (14 studies) suggested LSD could mildly reinforce conditioned place preference without aversion and reduce responsiveness to other rewards. Findings on reward learning were inconsistent but hinted at potential associative learning enhancements. Reward valuation measures indicated potential reductions in effort expenditure for other reinforcers. CONCLUSION: Our findings are consistent with our previous work, which indicated classical psychedelics, primarily serotonin 2A receptor agonists, enhanced reward responsiveness in healthy individuals and patient populations. Lysergic acid diethylamide exhibits a unique profile in the reward learning and valuation constructs. Using the RDoC-based framework, we identified areas for future research, enhancing our understanding of the impact of LSD on reward processing. However, applying RDoC to psychedelic research faces limitations due to diverse study designs that were not initially RDoC-oriented. Limitations include subjective outcome measure selection aligned with RDoC constructs and potential bias in synthesizing varied studies. Additionally, some human studies were open-label, introducing potential bias compared to randomized, blinded studies.",1,"[0.0027050802018493414, 0.9972949624061584]",1
1953,"Bidirectional relations between MDMA and social context: crosstalk between drug response and social interaction.^
Many drugs of abuse are used in social settings, i.e., in the presence of others. Yet, little is known about the effects of drugs in social contexts, including how they affect social interactions, or conversely, how social conditions affect responses to drugs. Ecstasy, or methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), in particular, is known for its prosocial effects, and it is typically used in groups. MDMA is thought to facilitate feelings of social connectedness. However, most controlled studies of the psychopharmacology of this and other abused drugs is that the effects of drugs are typically studied in a socially isolated setting, rather than in a social context. Thus, the full spectrum of drug effects may not be detected. To address this gap, we have conducted controlled, double blind laboratory studies to examine the effects of MDMA on measures of social function, including the ability to detect emotions in others, reactivity to positive and negative social images, and sensitivity to social rejection. We have also studied the effects of social context on responses to the drug, by testing participants in the presence of other subjects, including those who did or did not also receive the drug. Taken together, we have established that MDMA dampens reactivity to negative emotional expressions in others, that it reduces feelings of social rejection, and that its effects are enhanced in the presence of others. This line of research will help to understand the basis of recreational use of MDMA, as well as its potential therapeutic use.",1,"[0.0076510170474648476, 0.9923490285873413]",1
933,"Resting-state Network-specific Breakdown of Functional Connectivity during Ketamine Alteration of Consciousness in Volunteers.^
BACKGROUND: Consciousness-altering anesthetic agents disturb connectivity between brain regions composing the resting-state consciousness networks (RSNs). The default mode network (DMn), executive control network, salience network (SALn), auditory network, sensorimotor network (SMn), and visual network sustain mentation. Ketamine modifies consciousness differently from other agents, producing psychedelic dreaming and no apparent interaction with the environment. The authors used functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore ketamine-induced changes in RSNs connectivity. METHODS: Fourteen healthy volunteers received stepwise intravenous infusions of ketamine up to loss of responsiveness. Because of agitation, data from six subjects were excluded from analysis. RSNs connectivity was compared between absence of ketamine (wake state [W1]), light ketamine sedation, and ketamine-induced unresponsiveness (deep sedation [S2]). RESULTS: Increasing the depth of ketamine sedation from W1 to S2 altered DMn and SALn connectivity and suppressed the anticorrelated activity between DMn and other brain regions. During S2, DMn connectivity, particularly between the medial prefrontal cortex and the remaining network (effect size β [95% CI]: W1 = 0.20 [0.18 to 0.22]; S2 = 0.07 [0.04 to 0.09]), and DMn anticorrelated activity (e.g., right sensory cortex: W1 = -0.07 [-0.09 to -0.04]; S2 = 0.04 [0.01 to 0.06]) were broken down. SALn connectivity was nonuniformly suppressed (e.g., left parietal operculum: W1 = 0.08 [0.06 to 0.09]; S2 = 0.05 [0.02 to 0.07]). Executive control networks, auditory network, SMn, and visual network were minimally affected. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine induces specific changes in connectivity within and between RSNs. Breakdown of frontoparietal DMn connectivity and DMn anticorrelation and sensory and SMn connectivity preservation are common to ketamine and propofol-induced alterations of consciousness.",1,"[0.002983796177431941, 0.997016191482544]",1

Both the QIDS-SR16 and the PGI-S are self-report measures, and were collected at five timepoints (timepoints were approximately 2-7 days apart). Results: A total of 297 adults with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) as part of either DSM-5-defined MDD or BD were included. The MCT for the QIDS-SR16 revealed that a mean improvement of 3.38 points from baseline was comparable to a 1-point improvement on the PGI-S. Together with an examination of the probability density function, a 3.5-point change is a reasonable MCT (i.e., 1-point PGI-S improvement) for the QIDS-SR16. A 2-point symptomatic improvement on the QIDS-SR16 was associated with no change on the PGI-S. Conclusion: A 3.5-point reduction in the QIDS-SR16 represents a MCT based on the PGI-S for adults with treatment-resistant MDD or BD receiving intravenous ketamine treatment at a community-based mood disorders center. These findings are limited by the post-hoc nature of this analysis and open-label case-series design. Measurement-based care decisions by patients, providers and clinicians, as well as cost/reimbursement decisions should include consideration of meaningful change along with conventional objective outcomes.

2200,"Strenuous exercise aggravates MDMA-induced skeletal muscle damage in mice.^
The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of ecstasy (MDMA) administration on body temperature and soleus muscle histology in exercised and non-exercised mice. Charles-River mice were distributed into four groups: Control (C), exercise (EX), MDMA treated (M), and M + EX. The treated animals received an i.p. injection (10 mg/kg) of MDMA (saline for C and EX), and the exercise consisted of a 90 min level run at a velocity of 900 m/h, immediately after the MDMA or saline administration. Body temperature was recorded every 30 min via subcutaneous implanted transponder. Animals were sacrificed 1.5, 25.5, and 49.5 h after i.p. injection and the soleus muscles were removed and processed for light and electron microscopy. The MDMA-treated animals showed a significant increase in body temperature (similar in M and M + EX groups), reaching the peak 90 min after i.p. administration; their temperature remained higher than control for more than 5 h. The EX group evidenced a similar and parallel, yet lower temperature increase during exercise and recovery. Morphological signs of damage were rarely encountered in the EX group; they were more pronounced in M group and even aggravated in M + EX group. In conclusion, MDMA and exercise per se increased body temperature but in conjunction did not have a cumulated effect. However, ecstasy and concomitant physical activity might severely accumulate with regard to skeletal muscle toxicity and may lead to rhabdomyolysis. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

612,"MDMA and metabolite disposition in expectorated oral fluid after controlled oral MDMA administration.^
INTRODUCTION: The use of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is increasing, enhancing the need for its detection in clinical, workplace, pain management, and driving under the influence of drugs testing programs. Oral fluid is an important alternative matrix for drug testing, but little is known about MDMA detection windows in oral fluid. AIMS: The aim was to characterize MDMA and metabolite disposition in expectorated oral fluid after controlled MDMA administration. METHODS: Placebo, low (1.0 mg/kg), and high (1.6 mg/kg) oral MDMA doses were given double-blind in random order in separate sessions to 29 healthy adults with histories of MDMA use. One thousand two hundred eighty-six expectorated oral fluid specimens collected up to 7 days after dosing were analyzed for MDMA, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine (HMMA), and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine (HMA) by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The limits of quantification were 5 ng/mL for MDMA and MDA and 10 ng/mL for HMA and HMMA. RESULTS: MDMA was the primary analyte detected, with concentrations up to 12,000 ng/mL in 872 specimens (67.8%). MDA was quantified in 656 specimens (51.0%) at concentrations <403 ng/mL and was never present without concurrent MDMA. HMA and HMMA were not detected. Of the specimens, 59.8%, 58.6%, and 54.9% were found to be MDMA positive at the Talloires (20 ng/mL), Driving under the Influence of Drugs, Alcohol, and Medicines (25 ng/mL) and proposed US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (50 ng/mL) confirmation cutoffs, respectively. MDMA was first observed in oral fluid 0.25-1.25 hours after dosing; MDA was initially detected at 0.5-1.75 hours. In general, the windows of detection for MDMA and MDA were 47 and 29 hours, respectively, although a few specimens were positive up to 71 and 47 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Oral fluid monitoring efficiently detects single, recreational 70-150 mg of MDMA use for 1-2 days. These controlled administration data provide a scientific basis for interpreting MDMA oral fluid test results.",1,"[0.0024409957695752382, 0.9975589513778687]",1
3532,"[Substance use associated disorders: frequency in patients with schizophrenic and affective psychoses].^
BACKGROUND: Alcohol and substance use disorders (ASUD) are considered to be among the most frequent comorbidities in schizophrenic and affective psychoses and have a significant negative influence on their course and prognosis. In the present study patients with diagnosis from the ICD-10 category F2 or F3 were examined regarding a substance use disorder in a multicentre cross-section evaluation at nine psychiatric hospitals in Baden-Württemberg. The aim of this study is to discuss the current research on substance use disorders and psychosis comorbidity regarding the theoretical models by means of collected data. METHODS: The examination of 50 consecutive admissions per centre is based on a shortened version of the European Severity Index (Europ ASI). An initial urine drug screening was carried out with all patients after admission. Statistical assessment was based on percentage distributions, mean values, standard deviations and suitable correlation analysis. RESULTS: The representative sample included 448 patients. A proportion of 169 patients (37.7%) had a dual diagnosis F2 and F1 and a proportion of 144 patients (32.1%) had a dual diagnosis F3 and F1; 64 patients (14.3%) had an F2 diagnosis and 71 patients (15.8%) had an F3 diagnosis without ASUD. Apart from lifetime use of alcohol (n = 268) and tobacco (n = 325) hypnotics/tranquilizers (n = 214), cannabis (n = 156), opioids (n = 71), stimulants (n = 96) and hallucinogens (n = 36) were consumed. The most frequent combination and long-term intake consisted of tobacco, alcohol, hypnotics/tranquilizer, cannabis and psychostimulants especially in men with schizophrenic disorders. Regarding motivation before first substance use general psychological adjustment disorders (51%), peer impact (42%) and unspecific affective symptoms were predominant. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether the present study clearly demonstrates that patients suffering from schizophrenia, affective disorders and ASUD have significantly higher rates of more severe substance use disorders in their psychosocial environment and more suicidal behaviour than patients without substance misuse. The high rate in the cross-sectional prevalence of tobacco, alcohol, cannabis and psychostimulant use calls for more effective drug prevention.",0,"[0.9809615015983582, 0.019038429483771324]",0

4266,"Psychedelic science in post-COVID-19 psychiatry.^
The medium- to long-term consequences of COVID-19 are not yet known, though an increase in mental health problems are predicted. Multidisciplinary strategies across socio-economic and psychological levels may be needed to mitigate the mental health burden of COVID-19. Preliminary evidence from the rapidly progressing field of psychedelic science shows that psilocybin therapy offers a promising transdiagnostic treatment strategy for a range of disorders with restricted and maladaptive habitual patterns of cognition and behaviour, notably depression, addiction and obsessive compulsive disorder. The COMPASS Pathways (COMPASS) phase 2b double-blind trial of psilocybin therapy in antidepressant-free, treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is underway to determine the safety, efficacy and optimal dose of psilocybin. Results from the Imperial College London Psilodep-RCT comparing the efficacy and mechanisms of action of psilocybin therapy to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) escitalopram will soon be published. However, the efficacy and safety of psilocybin therapy in conjunction with SSRIs in TRD is not yet known. An additional COMPASS study, with a centre in Dublin, will begin to address this question, with potential implications for the future delivery of psilocybin therapy. While at a relatively early stage of clinical development, and notwithstanding the immense challenges of COVID-19, psilocybin therapy has the potential to play an important therapeutic role for various psychiatric disorders in post-COVID-19 clinical psychiatry.",0,"[0.9917418956756592, 0.008258172310888767]",1
3955,"Have Norwegians tried psilocybin, and do they accept it as a medicine?.^
Background: Psilocybin is emerging as a promising therapeutic agent for a wide range of psychiatric conditions, and clinical trials on psilocybin-assisted treatment are forthcoming in Scandinavian countries. However, little is known about attitudes towards this psychedelic compound among the general public in Nordic countries. This might represent a confound, and reduce the validity of research findings or the overall feasibility of conducting high-quality clinical trials. Aims: The main objective of this study is to address the knowledge gap surrounding use and attitudes towards psilocybin in Norway. Methods: We asked a representative sample of the Norwegian population (N = 1,078) if they have ever tried psilocybin and if they would be willing to do so as part of medical treatment. These questions were part of a larger online survey on a variety personal preferences and attitudes, and the survey was not presented as a study on psilocybin. Results: Of the 1,078 respondents, 8% reported previous psilocybin use and 51% were willing to try psilocybin in medical treatment. Conclusions: Psilocybin use is more common in Norway than the authors hypothesized, and the general public is relatively open to using psilocybin in a medical context. The latter is interpreted as promising with regards to the feasibility of conducting rigorous clinical trials on potential effects and side effects of psilocybin-assisted treatment in Norway.

BACKGROUND: The psychoactive stimulant 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), also known as ""ecstasy,"" is widely used in nonmedical settings. Little is known about its cardiovascular effects. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the acute cardiovascular effects of MDMA by using transthoracic two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography. DESIGN: Four-session, ascending-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Urban hospital. PATIENTS: Eight healthy adults who self-reported MDMA use. INTERVENTION: Echocardiographic effects of dobutamine (5, 20, and 40 microg/kg of body weight per minute) were measured in a preliminary session. Oral MDMA (0.5 and 1.5 mg/kg of body weight) or placebo was administered 1 hour before echocardiographic measurements in three weekly sessions. MEASUREMENTS: Heart rate and blood pressure were measured at regular intervals before and after MDMA administration. Echocardiographic measures of stroke volume, ejection fraction, cardiac output, and meridional wall stress were obtained 1 hour after MDMA administration and during dobutamine infusions. RESULTS: At a dose of 1.5 mg/kg, MDMA increased mean heart rate (by 28 beats/min), systolic blood pressure (by 25 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (by 7 mm Hg), and cardiac output (by 2 L/min). The effects of MDMA were similar to those of dobutamine, 20 and 40 microg/kg per minute. Inotropism, measured by using meridional wall stress corrected for ejection fraction, decreased after administration of dobutamine, 40 microg/kg per minute, but did not change after either dose of MDMA. CONCLUSIONS: Modest oral doses of MDMA increase heart rate, blood pressure, and myocardial oxygen consumption in a magnitude similar to dobutamine, 20 to 40 microg/kg per minute. In contrast to dobutamine, MDMA has no measurable inotropic effects.",1,"[0.002404914703220129, 0.9975950121879578]",1

All blood samples sent to the Department of Forensic Medicine at the University of Gottingen for drug content analysis (total number of 15179; 2019 of which were methamphetamine analyses) between 2008 and 2012 were examined. The samples tested positive for methamphetamine (total number of 136; 127 of which were taken from male subjects, 9 from female subjects) were then assessed with regard to age of the subject, blood concentration and possible parallel consumption of other drugs. The samples from 2012 (total number of 39) were further examined in respect to the offense ascertained by the police. During the observation period a considerably growing number of requests for methamphetamine analyses was noted (amount doubled), as well as a doubling of the number of positive samples. While the overall number of samples for drug content analysis increased, the relative percentages remained rather steady (12-15 % methamphetamine analyses, 6-9 % tested positive). 90 % of the subjects were under the age of 36 (total range of age: 21-47 years). 60 % of the samples tested positive for methamphetamine contained effective (> 10 ng/mL) to toxic (> 200 ng/mL) doses, the highest concentration found was 898,5 ng/mL. 59 % of the methamphetamine users consumed additional drugs (64 % cannabis, 40 % ecstasy, as well as cocaine, opiates and benzodiazepines).

3799,"A comparison of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy to non-assisted psychotherapy in treatment-resistant PTSD: A systematic review and meta-analysis.^
RATIONALE: Novel, evidence-based treatments are required for treatment-resistant post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) has beneficially augmented psychotherapy in several small clinical trials. OBJECTIVE: To review the use of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in treatment-resistant PTSD. METHODS: Systematic searches of four databases were conducted from inception to February 2020. A meta-analysis was performed on trials which were double-blinded, randomised, and compared MDMA-assisted psychotherapy to psychotherapy and placebo. The primary outcomes were the differences in Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-IV) score and Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI). Secondary outcome measures included neurocognitive and physical adverse effects, at the time, and within 7 days of intervention. RESULTS: Four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) met inclusion criteria. When compared to active placebo, intervention groups taking 75 mg (MD -46.90; 95% (confidence intervals) CI -58.78, -35.02), 125 mg (MD -20.98; 95% CI -34.35, -7.61) but not 100 mg (MD -12.90; 95% CI -36.09, 10.29) of MDMA with psychotherapy, had significant decreases in CAPS-IV scores, as did the inactive placebo arm (MD -33.20; 95% CI -40.53, -25.87). A significant decrease in BDI when compared to active placebo (MD -10.80; 95% CI -20.39, -1.21) was only observed at 75 mg. Compared to placebo, participants reported significantly more episodes of low mood, nausea and jaw-clenching during sessions and lack of appetite after 7 days. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate potential therapeutic benefit with minimal physical and neurocognitive risk for the use of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in TR-PTSD, despite little effect on Beck's Depression Inventory.

8064,"Comparison of postoperative delirium within 24 hours between ketamine and propofol infusion during cardiopulmonary bypass machine: A randomized controlled trial.^
BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common complication in cardiac surgery especially in elderly population which can lead to a delay of weaning from ventilator and extubation. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)-induced inflammation is related to POD. Anti-inflammatory effect of anesthetic agent might attenuate POD. AIMS: The present study was primarily aimed to compare within-24-h POD between ketamine-based anesthesia and propofol-based anesthesia during CPB. The secondary objective was to identify risk factors associated with within-24-h POD. SETTING AND DESIGN: Our study was a randomized controlled trial in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB. Enrolling patients were aged >65 years, and able to comprehensive communication. Exclusion criteria were aortic surgery, cognitive disorders, cerebrovascular and carotid disease, and positive result of preoperative CAM-ICU. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to group Ketamine infusion of 1 mg/kg/h and group Propofol infusion of 1.5-6 mg/kg/h during CPB. POD was evaluated by validated Thai version CAM-ICU at 8-24 hour after ICU arrival. STATISTICS: Chi-square, Fisher exact and t-test tests, univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were utilized. Results: Total 82 patients entered this study and 64 patients remained after exclusion (Group Ketamine = 32 and Group Propofol = 32). Within-24-h POD were 31.25% and 56.25% (P = 0.04) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were 71.45 and 65.53 mmHg (P = 0.01) respectively in Ketamine and Propofol group. Postoperative leukocytosis was a significant risk to POD (adjusted OR 124.5). CONCLUSION: With limitations of the study, prevention of 24-h POD in general by ketamine was inconclusive. In comparison with propofol, ketamine leaded to less events of 24-h POD and kept higher MAP. Severity of postoperative inflammation was a significant prediction of 24-h POD.",1,"[0.023742487654089928, 0.9762575030326843]",1

INTRODUCTION: Psilocybin-assisted therapy may be a new treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), with encouraging data from pilot trials. In this trial (short name: PsiDeR) we aimed to test the feasibility of a parallel-group, randomised, placebo-controlled design. The primary outcomes in this trial are measures of feasibility: recruitment rates, dropout rates and the variance of the primary outcome measure of depression. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We are recruiting up to 60 participants at a single centre in London, UK who are unresponsive to, or intolerant of, at least two evidence-based treatments for MDD. Participants are randomised to receive a single dosing session of 25 mg psilocybin or a placebo. All participants receive a package of psychological therapy. The primary outcome measure for depression is the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale collected by blinded, independent raters. The primary endpoint is at 3 weeks, and the total follow-up is 6 weeks. With further informed consent, this study collects neuroimaging and omics data for mechanism and biomarker analyses and offers participants an open label extension consisting of a further, open label dose of 25 mg of psilocybin.

3112,"Adjunctive Ketamine With Relapse Prevention-Based Psychological Therapy in the Treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder.^
OBJECTIVE: Early evidence suggests that ketamine may be an effective treatment to sustain abstinence from alcohol. The authors investigated the safety and efficacy of ketamine compared with placebo in increasing abstinence in patients with alcohol use disorder. An additional aim was to pilot ketamine combined with mindfulness-based relapse prevention therapy compared with ketamine and alcohol education as a therapy control. METHODS: In a double-blind placebo-controlled phase 2 clinical trial, 96 patients with severe alcohol use disorder were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: 1) three weekly ketamine infusions (0.8 mg/kg i.v. over 40 minutes) plus psychological therapy, 2) three saline infusions plus psychological therapy, 3) three ketamine infusions plus alcohol education, or 4) three saline infusions plus alcohol education. The primary outcomes were self-reported percentage of days abstinent and confirmed alcohol relapse at 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: Ninety-six participants (35 women; mean age, 44.07 years [SD=10.59]) were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The treatment was well tolerated, and no serious adverse events were associated with the study drug. Although confidence intervals were wide, consistent with a proof-of-concept study, there were a significantly greater number of days abstinent from alcohol in the ketamine group compared with the placebo group at 6-month follow-up (mean difference=10.1%, 95% CI=1.1, 19.0), with the greatest reduction in the ketamine plus therapy group compared with the saline plus education group (15.9%, 95% CI=3.8, 28.1). There was no significant difference in relapse rate between the ketamine and placebo groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that treatment with three infusions of ketamine was well tolerated in patients with alcohol use disorder and was associated with more days of abstinence from alcohol at 6-month follow-up.

Traditionally, the use of ketamine for patients with traumatic brain injuries is contraindicated due to the concern of increasing intracranial pressure (ICP). These concerns, however, originated from early studies and case reports that were inadequately controlled and designed. Recently, the concern of using ketamine in these patients has been challenged by a number of published studies demonstrating that the use of ketamine was safe in these patients. This article reviews the current literature in regards to using ketamine in patients with traumatic brain injuries in different clinical settings associated with anesthesia, as well as reviews the potential mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of ketamine. Studies examining the use of ketamine for induction, maintenance, and sedation in patients with TBI have had promising results. The use of ketamine in a controlled ventilation setting and in combination with other sedative agents has demonstrated no increase in ICP. The role of ketamine as a neuroprotective agent in humans remains inconclusive and adequately powered; randomized controlled trials performed in patients undergoing surgery for traumatic brain injury are necessary.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that psilocybin has antidepressant effects. In the current study, we aim to explore the dose effects of psilocybin on primary (major depression patients) and secondary depression (depressed cancer patients). METHODS: Published studies concerning psilocybin for depression were retrieved. In accordance with PRISMA guidelines, 6 databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Clinicaltrials.gov 2.3 and WanFang database) were searched for research studies published or still in progress from inception to 30 November, 2020, with language restricted to English and Chinese. Hedges' g of Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score changes was calculated as the primary outcome. RESULTS: 7 articles were finally included, with a total of 136 participants. In terms of efficacy, Hedges' g was 1.289 (95%CI=[1.020, 1.558], heterogeneity I(2)=50.995%, p<0.001). As psilocybin dose increases within a certain range, the antidepressive effect declines and then increases, with 30-35 mg/70 kg achieving the optimal therapeutic effect. Subgroup analysis suggested that the antidepressive effect of psilocybin was extremely significant at a relatively high dose (30-35mg/70kg: Hedges' g=3.059, 95%CI=[2.269, 3.849], p<0.001), long-term (>1month: Hedges' g=1.123, 95%CI=[0.861, 1.385], p<0.001) and when used in primary depression patients (Hedges' g=2.190, 95%CI=[1.423, 2.957], p<0.001). LIMITATIONS: Only a small number of studies can be identified of variable quality, thus our conclusions remain preliminary. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results have shown that psilocybin exerts a rapid effect in reducing depressive symptom on primary and secondary depression.

716,"Is ecstasy an ""empathogen""? Effects of ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine on prosocial feelings and identification of emotional states in others.^
BACKGROUND: Users of ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), ""ecstasy,"" report that the drug produces unusual psychological effects, including increased empathy and prosocial feelings. These ""empathogenic"" effects are cited as reasons for recreational ecstasy use and also form the basis for the proposed use of MDMA in psychotherapy. However, they have yet to be characterized in controlled studies. Here, we investigate effects of MDMA on an important social cognitive capacity, the identification of emotional expression in others, and on socially relevant mood states. METHODS: Over four sessions, healthy ecstasy-using volunteers (n = 21) received MDMA (.75, 1.5 mg/kg), methamphetamine (METH) (20 mg), and placebo under double-blind, randomized conditions. They completed self-report ratings of relevant affective states and undertook tasks in which they identified emotions from images of faces, pictures of eyes, and vocal cues. RESULTS: MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) significantly increased ratings of feeling ""loving"" and ""friendly"", and MDMA (.75 mg/kg) increased ""loneliness"". Both MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) and METH increased ""playfulness""; only METH increased ""sociability"". MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) robustly decreased accuracy of facial fear recognition relative to placebo. CONCLUSIONS: The drug MDMA increased ""empathogenic"" feelings but reduced accurate identification of threat-related facial emotional signals in others, findings consistent with increased social approach behavior rather than empathy. This effect of MDMA on social cognition has implications for both recreational and therapeutic use. In recreational users, acute drug effects might alter social risk-taking while intoxicated. Socioemotional processing alterations such as those documented here might underlie possible psychotherapeutic benefits of this drug; further investigation of such mechanisms could inform treatment design to maximize active components of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.",1,"[0.002636830322444439, 0.9973631501197815]",1

The primary outcome was the standardized mean difference (SMD) in depression severity, determined by calculating the change in depression ratings from baseline to the primary endpoint in the psilocybin arm versus the control arm. The literature search yielded 1734 studies, and 13 studies (n = 686) were included in either qualitative and/or quantitative analyses. The meta-analysis included 9 studies (pooled n = 596) and yielded a large effect size in favour of psilocybin (SMD = -0.78; p<0.001). Risk ratios for response and remission were large and significant in favour of psilocybin. A review of open-label trials showed robust decreases in depressive symptoms following psilocybin administration. These findings provide preliminary evidence for antidepressant efficacy with psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy, however, further studies are needed to evaluate safety and efficacy and to optimize treatment protocols.",1,"[0.00361640308983624, 0.996383547782898]",1
3176,"Psilocybin produces substantial and sustained decreases in depression and anxiety in patients with life-threatening cancer: A randomized double-blind trial.^
Cancer patients often develop chronic, clinically significant symptoms of depression and anxiety. Previous studies suggest that psilocybin may decrease depression and anxiety in cancer patients. The effects of psilocybin were studied in 51 cancer patients with life-threatening diagnoses and symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. This randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial investigated the effects of a very low (placebo-like) dose (1 or 3 mg/70 kg) vs. a high dose (22 or 30 mg/70 kg) of psilocybin administered in counterbalanced sequence with 5 weeks between sessions and a 6-month follow-up. Instructions to participants and staff minimized expectancy effects. Participants, staff, and community observers rated participant moods, attitudes, and behaviors throughout the study. High-dose psilocybin produced large decreases in clinician- and self-rated measures of depressed mood and anxiety, along with increases in quality of life, life meaning, and optimism, and decreases in death anxiety. At 6-month follow-up, these changes were sustained, with about 80% of participants continuing to show clinically significant decreases in depressed mood and anxiety. Participants attributed improvements in attitudes about life/self, mood, relationships, and spirituality to the high-dose experience, with >80% endorsing moderately or greater increased well-being/life satisfaction. Community observer ratings showed corresponding changes. Mystical-type psilocybin experience on session day mediated the effect of psilocybin dose on therapeutic outcomes.

3959,"Efficacy and safety of oral ketamine versus diclofenac to alleviate mild to moderate depression in chronic pain patients: A double-blind, randomized, controlled trial.^
BACKGROUND: Ketamine is a glutamate N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist capable of exerting antidepressive effects in single or repeated intravenous infusions. The objective of this study was to investigate the safety and the efficacy of oral ketamine vs. diclofenac monotherapy in reducing symptoms of mild to moderate depression among patients with chronic pain. METHODS: This study is a 6-week, randomized, double-blind, controlled, parallel-group trial with two intervention arms (ketamine, fixed daily dosage of 150mg vs. diclofenac, fixed daily dosage of 150mg). Twenty participants in each arm completed the trial program all of whom had two post-baseline measurements at week 3 and week 6. Reduction in depression symptoms was assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the hospital anxiety and depression subscale for depression (HADSDepression) scores at baseline and week 3 and week 6 post-intervention. RESULTS: Significantly lower HDRS scores were observed in the ketamine treatment group as early as 6 weeks post-intervention (P=0.008). By comparison, mean (±standard deviation) HADS depression subscale scores were significantly lower for individuals receiving ketamine compared to diclofenac for both post-baseline measures at week 3 (6.95±1.47 vs. 8.40±1.6, P=0.005) and week 6 (6.20±1.15 vs. 7.35±1.18, p=0.003). LIMITATIONS: The limitations of the present study were its small sample size and the short-term follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Oral ketamine appears to be a safe and effective option in improving depressive symptoms of patients with chronic pain with mild-to-moderate depression.",1,"[0.0029228755738586187, 0.9970771074295044]",1
6189,"LSD Base and LSD Tartrate Bioequivalence and Bioavailability in Healthy Subjects.^
LSD is widely used for recreational and spiritual purposes. Additionally LSD is currently reused in experimental studies with healthy subjects and in studies investigating its effects on patients suffering from anxiety, depression, addiction personality disorders, cluster headache, migraine, and other pathological conditions. When LSD is used recreationally, it is administered mostly in the form of LSD tartrate on filter paper (blotter) or as a liquid. In experimental research over the past years, LSD has mostly been used in the form of LSD base, which is lipophilic and therefore has typically been administered as a solution in ethanol. However, some researchers have also use LSD tartrate orally or LSD base intravenously. Currently, it is not clear how these different forms of LSD compare regarding their bioequivalence and effects. The present study therefore compares four different formulations of LSD and placebo: (1) An oral drinking solution of LSD base currently used in many research studies (100 μg LSD in 96% ethanol), (2) A solid orodispersible film containing LSD base (100 μg LSD), (3) LSD tartrate used in research and recreationally (100 μg LSD equivalent of LSD tartrate in water), (4) an intravenous administration of LSD tartrate (100 μg LSD equivalent of LSD tartrate in water), and (5) placebo for all formulations (quadruple‐dummy). The primary goals are to document the bioequivalence of LSD base (1) and tartrate (3) and to define the oral bioavailability of LSD using an additional intravenous LSD administration.",1,"[0.0031648988369852304, 0.9968351721763611]",1
4094,"Race and ethnicity moderate the associations between lifetime psychedelic use (MDMA/ecstasy and psilocybin) and major depressive episodes.^
Background: Psychedelics are receiving renewed attention within Western medicine as they represent potential treatments for many difficult-to-treat mental health disorders. However, psychedelic science is limited in its focus and inclusion of racial and ethnic minorities. Hence, this study examines whether race and ethnicity moderate the associations that naturalistic 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)/ecstasy use and psilocybin use share with major depressive episodes (MDEs). Method: Data for this project are from The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2005–2019). Participants were adults aged 18 years and older (unweighted N = 596,187). This study used multivariable logistic regression to test the interaction between race and ethnicity and MDMA/ecstasy use and psilocybin use for predicting lifetime, past year, and past year severe MDEs. Results: Race and ethnicity significantly moderated the associations between MDMA/ecstasy use and psilocybin use and MDEs. For White participants, MDMA/ecstasy use and psilocybin use each were associated with lowered odds of all three MDE outcomes (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) range: 0.82–0.92). For Hispanic participants, MDMA/ecstasy use and psilocybin use each conferred lowered odds of only a past year MDE (MDMA/ecstasy aOR: 0.82; psilocybin aOR: 0.79). For Non-Hispanic Racial Minority participants, MDMA/ecstasy and psilocybin use did not confer lowered odds of any MDE outcomes. Conclusion: Race and ethnicity have an impact on the associations that psychedelics share with mental health outcomes. Future research should explore the impact of identity and discrimination on the effects of psychedelics and should explore whether these substances can serve as effective treatments for minorities when used in culturally informed contexts.",1,"[0.0033999227453023195, 0.9966000914573669]",1
5221,"The Therapeutic Potential of Psychedelic-assisted Therapies for Symptom Control in Patients Diagnosed With Serious Illness: A Systematic Review.^
CONTEXT: People affected by serious illness usually experience suffering in its various dimensions, not only in the physical but also in the psychosocial and spiritual aspects. The interest in psychedelic-assisted therapies as a potential new therapeutic modality has increased since evidence suggests a significant impact of their use on the outcomes of patients with serious illness. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the available evidence on the effects of psychedelic-assisted therapies for symptom control in patients diagnosed with serious illness. METHODS: The protocol of this systematic review has been prepared according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols guidelines. This review included randomized and non-randomized controlled trials published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. A comprehensive search for studies was carried out in the main scientific databases, including Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, PubMed, CINAHL, and EMBASE. There were no limitations regarding the year or language of publication. RESULTS: The sample was composed of 20 studies. The results suggest positive effects of psychedelic-assisted therapies for symptom control in patients diagnosed with serious illness, with considerable safety of use. Most studies have been conducted with lysergic acid diethylamide, psilocybin, and N,N-dipropyltryptamine in cancer patients.

1837,"Lysergic acid diethylamide: a drug of ‘use’?.^
Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), described as a classical hallucinogen, began its journey from the middle of the last century following an accidental discovery. Since then, it was used as a popular and notorious substance of abuse in various parts of the world. Its beneficial role as an adjunct to psychotherapy was much unknown, until some ‘benevolent’ experiments were carried out over time to explore some of its potential uses. But, many of its effects were unclear and seemed to be a psychedelic enigma. In this review article, we have described the receptor pharmacology, mechanism of action, effects and adverse effects of LSD on the normal body system. We have also highlighted its addictive potentials and the chances of developing tolerance. We have assimilated some of the interesting therapeutic uses of this drug, such as an antianxiety agent, a creativity enhancer, a suggestibility enhancer, and a performance enhancer. We have also described LSD to be successfully used in drug and alcohol dependence, and as a part of psychedelic peak therapy in terminally ill patients. The relevant chronological history and literature in the light of present knowledge and scenarios have been discussed. Based on available evidence, LSD could be tried therapeutically in certain specific conditions under controlled settings. But as we mention, due to all the safety concerns, the use of this nonaddictive ‘entheogen’ in actual practice warrants a lot of expertise, caution, cooperation and ethical considerations.",0,"[0.9950410723686218, 0.004958971403539181]",0
299,"The use of ibogaine in the treatment of addictions.^
Ibogaine is a naturally occurring iboga alkaloid, a chemical taxonomic category presently known to contain approximately 80 naturally occurring and synthetic compounds, some of which reportedly reduce the self-administration of drugs of abuse and opiate withdrawal symptoms in animal models and humans (Alper et al. 2001). Ibogaine is isolated from the root bark of Tabernanthe iboga native to West Central Africa, where it has been used as a religious sacrament for centuries (Fernandez 1982; Goutarelet al. 1993) before it was observed in the United States and Europe to have apparent effects on opioid withdrawal and other drug dependence syndromes. As reviewed in this chapter, major published scientific evidence for ibogaine's effectiveness includes reduced drug self-administration and withdrawal in animals, and case reports and open-label trials in humans. From a pharmacological standpoint, ibogaine is interesting because it appears to have a novel mechanism of action that is different from other existing pharmacotherapeutic approaches to addiction. The question of ibogaine's mechanism of action is important because its ultimate significance may be a paradigm for understanding the neurobiology of addiction as well as the development of new medications. The sections of this chapter address the following ibogaine topics: History; Pharmacology; Subjective effects; Evidence of efficacy; Learning, memory, and addiction; Clinical use of ibogaine; and Future research. Acute opioid withdrawal is the indication for which ibogaine has most frequently been given (Alper et al. 1999 and 2001; Frenken 2001), which distinguishes the ibogaine subculture from subcultures involving other hallucinogenic drugs. It is a clinically robust phenomenon that can be appreciated by a lay clinical observer and produces a relatively clear outcome occurring within a limited time frame. The lay individuals involved in the ibogaine subculture are very likely to be capable of making valid clinical observations regarding the absence or presence of the signs of acute opioid withdrawal. To apply the term 'triangulation' as a validating principle in the clinical medical context, it is interesting that a similar effect of ibogaine in acute opiate withdrawal is evident in the animal model, the numerous and consistent accounts of subculture participants, and published case series. The ibogaine medical subculture reflects that drug users actively seek alternatives to present treatment options despite medical risk, expense, and possible legal prosecution. The patient has primacy in the moral and ethical hierarchy of medicine, and it is fitting to end this chapter with a quote posted to an Internet message board from a patient reflecting on ibogaine treatment. The sense of marginalization, and affirmation of a belief in a real pharmacological effect, is familiar to anyone experienced with talking with ibogaine treatment providers or individuals who have been treated.

The aim of this study was to examine rave-related polydrug drug use and to determine if patterns of substance use were associated with previous rave attendance. One hundred and eighty-six rave attendees (50% female) representing a wide range of ages (16 to 47 years; mean = 23.5, sd = 5.15) and levels of rave attendance experience (1 to 400 events) completed structured interviews in Montreal, Canada between November 2002 and September 2003 about their rave attendance patterns and their use of various licit and illicit substances at the most recently attended event. On average, participants reported using 2.5 different psychoactive substances (excluding tobacco) at the most recent event attended. Cannabis, alcohol, MDMA (ecstasy), amphetamine, cocaine, ketamine, and GHB were the most frequently reported substances, and details about their orders of administration, dosages, and patterns of co-administration are presented and discussed. The total lifetime number of raves attended by participants varied considerably (mean = 48.6; sd = 69.7; median = 25), and there was a positive correlation between the number events attended and number of substances used at the most recent event attended (p < 0.001). Analyses revealed that individuals reporting the use of ketamine, GHB, and/or cocaine at the most recent event had attended significantly more events than nonusers even when controlling for various demographic variables. A subset of respondents (n = 27) completed a second interview to determine the reliability of their responses. Results indicated that respondents could reliably recall details about which drugs were used, the total doses administered, as well as order of drug administration.

6106,"Evaluation of Schemes of Administration of Intravenous Ketamine in Depression.^
1. Background 1.1 Major depressive disorder (MDD) MDD is a clinical syndrome characterized by the presence of low modo, anhedonia, appetite and weight changes, sleep disturbances, psychomotor alterations, fatigue, guilt and low self‐esteem, ideas related to death or suicide, and concentration difficulties. MDD represents one of the first causes of disability worldwide. In Mexico, prevalence is estimated in 7.2% of the population. In accordance to the largest clinical trial of MDD, the STAR*D (Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression), up to one third of the patients will not achieve remission after 4 treatment strategies. These obligates research of new treatments for MDD and treatment‐resistant depression TRD. 1.2 Treatment‐resistant Depression (TRD) There is a lack of consensus to define TRD, with multiple criteria used by distinct authors. However, the most used definition is the failure to achieve response or remission after two consecutive treatments at an adequate dose and duration, considering the last episode. 1.3 Physiopathology of MDD. Historically, serotonin and noradrenaline disturbances in production, metabolism and reuptake have been implicated in MDD, as well as dopamine. However, this hypothesis seems insufficient in explaining the lack of immediate response, and the lack of response of up to one third of patients. It is necessary to understand MDD as a multifactorial disorder (biological, psychological, and environmental agents). At a genetic level, some polymorphisms have been related to the appearance of MDD, such as the gen associated with the glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1, the one related to the monoaminooxidase‐A, and the one related to the glucogen kinase‐synthase 3. Heredability for MDD has been calculated around 37%. In a molecular basis, there are three principal factors implicated in the genesis of MDD: neurotrophic factors such as brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin‐1 beta, 6, tumoral necrosis factor alpha), and a dysregulation in the hypothalamus‐hypophysis‐adrenal axis. Anatomically speaking, the majority of neuroimaging studies converge in the existence of a hyperactive amygdala, ventral striatum and medial prefrontal cortex to negative stimuli. Among regions of major interest are the amygdala, prefrontal cortex, the cingulate gyrus in its subgenual area and anterior or pregenual area (pgACC), ventral striatum, medial thalamus, posterior cingulate gyrus and anterior insulae. 1.5 Glutamate and GABA in MDD y GABA Glutamatergic and GABAergic dysfunction in affective disorders has increased interest in the last years, evidenced by clinical neuroimaging studies that demonstrate disturbances in such systems in patients with MDD, animal models of stress, and the role of glucocorticoids in the glutamatergic regulation secondary to chronic stress, as well as studies about the action of antidepressants in these systems. 1.6 Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy H1‐MRS in MDD H1‐MRS studies coincide with the diminution of glutamate, glutamine and Glx (a composite measure of the previous two) in patients with MDD compared to controls in the pgCCA. Such finding has been correlated with the severity of MDD and anomalous connectivity with the anterior insulae. pgACC activity has been shown to be a predictor of response of some depression treatments such as pharmacological treatments and transcranial magnetic stimulation. Because of these findings, it is of great interest for the investigators to study this region in relation to ketamine interventions as an antidepressant therapy. Its clinical effects make ketamine a candidate to solve problems related to MDD in public health, confirmed by various systematic reviews and meta‐analysis. 2.1 Key questions Disturbed GABA neurotransmission has been also found in the occipital cortex in patients with MDD and TRD, suggesting a possible biomarker for differential diagnosis. Specifically in TRD patients, Glx in pgACC have been found to be altered, however more studies are needed. 1. pgACC in MDD pgACC in MDD refers to the rostral portion of the ACC that englobes the anterior portion of the corpus callosum, nominated sometimes as the medial prefrontal cortex. It comprises Brodmann's areas 24, 25, 32 and 33. The pgACC corresponds to the area 33. Through models of meta‐analytic connectivity, its role in the production of interception and subjective feelings, coordinating responses appropriate to internal and external events along with the insulae, and its involvement in the representation of interoceptive information have been confirmed. It seems also to represent the area in with the distinction of cognition and affect takes place39. Such function is supported by evidence of structures connected to the pgACC (lateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortices, and limbic regions). Functional MRI (fMRI), has demonstrated an increased connectivty between pgACC and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, as well as a diminution in the connectivity of the pgACC and caudate. Such findings may be explained by an intense cognitive control over emotional regulation in MDD patients. There is evidence of abnormal glutamatergic abnormalities in cerebral activity in resting state in MDD patients, finding a correlation between lower glutamate levels in the pgACC and a diminished connectivity of the same area with the anterior insulae compared to controls through H1‐MRS and BOLD techniques. 1.9 Ketamine as an antidepressant Ever since the first clinical study reporting the use of ketamine as an antidepressant for TRD patients, showing a rapid (in hours) and robust (in days) response after a unique administration, the literature has grown exponentially. However, mechanisms of action remain inconclusive. Its antidepressant properties have been vinculated by ketamine's capacity to stimulate the release and expression of BDNF. Contrary to the result of chronic stress, inhibiting these results, ketamine seems to stimulate it. This molecule is involved in the modulation of neuroplasticity, specifically in the prefrontal cortices. Another of the explanations in a molecular level has been its regulation in the glycogen kinase‐synthase 3 (GSK3), required for the pruning and synaptic reconsolidation50. Finally, ketamine has been shown to regulate the lateral habenula (implicated in MDD), probably also explaining its role in the down‐regulation of monoamines. There are clinical trials reporting the efficacy of repeated administrations of ketamine (from 7 days up to 83 days after the last administration) with IV ketamine and intranasal esketamine. However, studies vary in the number of interventions, intervals, conditions to continue treatment, times of measurements, follow‐up, making it impossible to obtain standardized results. Also, repeated doses have not been reported with H1‐MRS technique to explore if there are durable changes after chronic administration of subanesthetic doses of ketamine in MDD. 3. Will this response, if achieved, be different than changes in Glutamate and GABA in the pgACC among patients receiving placebo? 3. METHODOLOGY 3.1 Design A double‐blind randomized clinical trial (initially) will be performed, followed by an open‐label trial. Subjects treated in the NINN will be divided in two groups: 1. Subjects with TRD, receiving ketamine infusions from start. 2. Subjects with TRD, receiving placebo (saline solution 0.9%), and afterwards 3.3 Procedure 1. Sampling. 2. Previous evaluation: 1. Psychiatric evaluation (HDRS‐17, MADRS). 2. Medical evaluation 1.10 Glutamatergic and GABAergic chances in pgACC before ketamine administration H1‐MRS data concerning glutamate levels in healthy subjects show that after ketamine administration, there is a significative increase in glutamate in the pgACC, correlating with psychopathology scales such as the PANSS, supporting the idea that ketamine exerts an important effect in the neurotransmission related to its mechanism of action in this region of interest. Such findings propose the difference in this region of interest pre and postinfusion of ketamine and repr sent an important antecedent for the current proposal. In a similar way, in healthy subjects, hippocampal augments of Glx and a decreased of the fronto‐temporal connectivity and temporo‐parietal after the administration measured at 10 minutes after ketamine administration has been shown. When measuring glutamate, Glx and GABA in the pgACC after ketamine in MDD patients, there have been mixed results. Some authors have found a significative increase of the same, correlating with clinical response when measuring during the infusion53. However, using major tesla MRI and measuring the effect of ketamine in glutamate at 24 hours after administration show no differences against placebo. Both findings are discussed concerning the time of measure, concluding that there is a rapid and robust increase, but a transitory one. However these changes do not persist. To our knowledge no H1‐MRS studies after a series of ketamine infusions to know if there are durable changes in glutamate of GABA levels that may explain the durable antidepressant effects of ketamine. 1.11 Experience in the National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery (NINN), Mexico Clinical experience with ketamine as an antidepressant and augmentation agent to conventional antidepressants has shown similar clinical results as reported previously, and even have shown longer times until relapse. There is extensive experience in the utilization of H1‐MRS in other disorders. The investigators consider that this institution is ideal for the development of the current proposal. 1. Will patients with TRD have a clinical response (50%) after the infusion of ketamine as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) during the first 24 hours, and different to patients receiving placebo? 2. Will TRD patients presenting response, present a significant increase in Glutamate and GABA in the pgACC measured by H1‐MRS 24 hours after the last intervention, compared to the basal measure? 3.2 Sample During the sample selection, inclusion and exclusion criteria defined afterwards will be used. Sampling will be non‐probabilistic in a consecutive case manner. Patients will participate voluntarily after informed consent is achieved. 3. Randomization 4. Basal 1H‐MRS for GABA: 5. Basal 1H‐MRS for Glutamate: Similar to the GABA acquisition. 6. Interventions 1. All interventions will be done as an out‐patient basis by a psychiatrist. 2. A 0.5 mg/kg infusion of ketamine or placebo IV along 40 minutes will be performed. Vigilance will be strict (vital signs, adverse effects, subjective experience, clinimetry). 3. After every intervention, the patient will be observed for 1 hour or more if considered necessary by the clinician, returning to their normal routine afterward. 4.

1431,"Role of klotho on antidepressant and antisuicidal effects of low-dose ketamine infusion among patients with treatment-resistant depression and suicidal ideation.^
OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have found an association between klotho, an anti-aging hormone, and major depressive disorder. However, whether low-dose ketamine infusion alters klotho levels among patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) remains unknown. METHODS: In total, 48 patients with TRD and strong suicidal ideation were randomly assigned to a single 0.5 mg/kg ketamine or 0.045 mg/kg midazolam regimen and were subjected to a 2-week follow-up. Depressive and suicidal symptoms were assessed before the infusion and during the follow-up. The serum levels of klotho were assessed at baseline and 3 days postinfusion. RESULTS: A generalized linear model with adjustment of baseline klotho levels showed that, despite the fact that ketamine did not significantly increase levels of klotho, patients in the ketamine group had higher levels of klotho at Day 3 postinfusion than patients in the midazolam group (p = 0.043). However, we found no association between changes in klotho levels and changes in depressive and suicidal symptoms (all p > 0.05). Higher klotho levels at baseline were associated with poorer antidepressant effect of low-dose ketamine during postinfusion follow-up. DISCUSSION: Klotho may play a role in the antidepressant effect of low-dose ketamine. Additional molecular studies are necessary to elucidate the neuromechanisms of TRD, ketamine, and klotho.",1,"[0.002483068034052849, 0.9975169897079468]",1

Patients were crossed-over to receive the alternate treatment during the next WCP. Results: Eleven male patients participated in the study. Mean rank of pain intensity during WCP-MK was significantly less than during WCP-MS (P = 0.005). Mean ± standard error of mean pain intensity during the WCP-MK was 3.09 ± 0.99, whereas it was 6.82 ± 0.92 during the WCP-MS. However, 91% of the patients had adverse effects (eg, strange sensations, hallucinations, blurred vision) with MK versus 0% with MS. Diastolic blood pressure was significantly higher during the WCP-MK. Discussion: Ketamine with morphine significantly reduced procedural wound pain intensity during WCP. Adverse effects and higher diastolic BP occurred with MK. Further research is warranted to determine the optimal analgesic dose of ketamine or if the addition of a benzodiazepine would mitigate the psychotomimetic effects of ketamine.

518,"Intimate insight: MDMA changes how people talk about significant others.^
RATIONALE: ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is widely believed to increase sociability. The drug alters speech production and fluency, and may influence speech content. Here, we investigated the effect of MDMA on speech content, which may reveal how this drug affects social interactions. METHOD: Thirty-five healthy volunteers with prior MDMA experience completed this two-session, within-subjects, double-blind study during which they received 1.5 mg/kg oral MDMA and placebo. Participants completed a five-minute standardized talking task during which they discussed a close personal relationship (e.g. a friend or family member) with a research assistant. The conversations were analyzed for selected content categories (e.g. words pertaining to affect, social interaction, and cognition), using both a standard dictionary method (Pennebaker's Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count: LIWC) and a machine learning method using random forest classifiers. RESULTS: Both analytic methods revealed that MDMA altered speech content relative to placebo. Using LIWC scores, the drug increased use of social and sexual words, consistent with reports that MDMA increases willingness to disclose. Using the machine learning algorithm, we found that MDMA increased use of social words and words relating to both positive and negative emotions. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with reports that MDMA acutely alters speech content, specifically increasing emotional and social content during a brief semistructured dyadic interaction. Studying effects of psychoactive drugs on speech content may offer new insights into drug effects on mental states, and on emotional and psychosocial interaction.",1,"[0.0025780063588172197, 0.9974219799041748]",1
793,"Subjective and Behavioral Effects of Microdoses of LSD in Healthy Human Volunteers.^
Background: There have been numerous anecdotal reports that very low doses of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) reduce depressed mood and improve positive outlook. Yet, the effects of such “microdoses” have not been tested under double‐blind, placebo‐controlled conditions. As a first step, we examined the subjective and behavioral effects of single low doses of LSD in healthy adults. Methods: Volunteers (N=20) attended four laboratory sessions during with they received placebo, 6.5μg, 13μg, or 26μg LSD in randomized order. During expected peak drug effect, they completed mood questionnaires and behavioral tasks assessing emotion processing, including i) recognition of emotional facial expressions and ii) responses to simulated social rejection. Results: LSD dose‐dependently increased ratings of “feeling” the drug, “liking” the drug, and “feeling high,” in addition to dose‐dependently increasing responses to the Altered States of Consciousness questionnaire. The highest dose of LSD increased vigor, elation, and anxiety on the Profile of Mood States. On the emotion recognition task, LSD enhanced participants’ ability to recognize both anger and happiness. During the simulated social rejection task, LSD increased participants’ desire to play again with the other players, but did not affect their perception of the degree to which they were included or excluded. Conclusions: These findings with non‐symptomatic volunteers suggest that “microdoses” of LSD have dose‐dependent effects on mood and emotional behavior. These results set the stage for measuring the clinical efficacy of the drug in the treatment of depressed mood, and help to understand the expanding use of low doses of LSD in the community.

642,"Psilocybin acutely alters the functional connectivity of the claustrum with brain networks that support perception, memory, and attention.^
Psychedelic drugs, including the serotonin 2a (5-HT(2A)) receptor partial agonist psilocybin, are receiving renewed attention for their possible efficacy in treating a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders. Psilocybin induces widespread dysregulation of cortical activity, but circuit-level mechanisms underlying this effect are unclear. The claustrum is a subcortical nucleus that highly expresses 5-HT(2A) receptors and provides glutamatergic inputs to arguably all areas of the cerebral cortex. We therefore tested the hypothesis that psilocybin modulates claustrum function in humans. Fifteen healthy participants (10M, 5F) completed this within-subjects study in which whole-brain resting-state blood-oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal was measured 100 ​min after blinded oral administration of placebo and 10 mg/70 ​kg psilocybin. Left and right claustrum signal was isolated using small region confound correction. Psilocybin significantly decreased both the amplitude of low frequency fluctuations as well as the variance of BOLD signal in the left and right claustrum. Psilocybin also significantly decreased functional connectivity of the right claustrum with auditory and default mode networks (DMN), increased right claustrum connectivity with the fronto-parietal task control network (FPTC), and decreased left claustrum connectivity with the FPTC. DMN integrity was associated with right-claustrum connectivity with the DMN, while FPTC integrity and modularity were associated with right claustrum and left claustrum connectivity with the FPTC, respectively. Subjective effects of psilocybin predicted changes in the amplitude of low frequency fluctuations and the variance of BOLD signal in the left and right claustrum. Observed effects were specific to claustrum, compared to flanking regions of interest (the left and right insula and putamen). This study used a pharmacological intervention to provide the first empirical evidence in any species for a significant role of 5-HT(2A) receptor signaling in claustrum functioning, and supports a possible role of the claustrum in the subjective and therapeutic effects of psilocybin.",1,"[0.0030052398797124624, 0.9969947338104248]",1

5396,"Reconsidering ""dissociation"" as a predictor of antidepressant efficacy for esketamine.^
RATIONALE: The relationship between subjective drug experience and antidepressant outcomes for ketamine derivatives is poorly understood but of high clinical relevance. Esketamine is the patented (S)-enantiomer of ketamine and has regulatory approval for psychiatric applications. OBJECTIVES: We examined the relationship between acute dissociation, as measured by the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS), and antidepressant efficacy, as measured by the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), for esketamine across the 4-week induction phase of treatment. METHODS: This post hoc analysis combined data (N = 576) from the TRANSFORM-1 and TRANSFORM-2 clinical trials of esketamine for treatment-resistant depression. Linear mixed models were performed using total MADRS score as the outcome variable with the following independent variables: baseline MADRS score, treatment condition × time interaction, and CADSS × time interaction. To assess whether initial dissociation predicted rapid antidepressant benefit with esketamine, a separately planned regression was performed with day 2 MADRS as the outcome variable with the following dependent variables: baseline MADRS, treatment condition, and day 1 CADSS. RESULTS: The linear mixed model did not show any effect of a CADSS × time interaction (p = 0.7). Looking solely at the effect of day 1 CADSS on day 2 MADRS revealed that each additional CADSS point was associated with a - .04 [95% CI - .08, - .002] (p = .04) decrease in MADRS score. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence of a clinically significant positive or negative association between dissociation and antidepressant effect for esketamine. Our findings suggest that subsequent inquiry in this area will benefit from improved characterization of drug experiences relevant to therapeutic outcomes.",1,"[0.003141953144222498, 0.9968580007553101]",1

BACKGROUND: The treatment of ketamine users is substantially challenged by high dropout rates, raising questions regarding contributing factors. A number of studies have highlighted the potential of greater focus on the clinical significance of cognitive impairments in ketamine users. The present study hypothesized that cognitive deficits would play a role in greater risk for treatment dropout in chronic ketamine users. METHODS: Our study examined cognitive performance in the form of working memory, verbal memory, visual memory and executive function among chronic ketamine users who completed three-month treatment in residential detoxification centres (N = 165), those who dropped out prematurely (N = 121) and drug-free healthy controls (N = 111). The data collection was completed in Hong Kong among the East Asia population. RESULTS: Compared to healthy controls, cognitive impairments were found in ketamine users, including in verbal/visual memory and executive function. Executive dysfunction was significantly associated with dropout in ketamine users within three months. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that executive dysfunction may have clinical benefits in ketamine users admitted to residential treatment programmes.",1,"[0.0029219016432762146, 0.9970780611038208]",1
9258,"The psychedelic effects of cannabis: A review of the literature.^
Cannabis and classic psychedelics are controlled substances with emerging evidence of efficacy in the treatment of a variety of psychiatric illnesses. Cannabis has largely not been regarded as having psychedelic effects in contemporary literature, despite many examples of historical use along with classic psychedelics to attain altered states of consciousness. Research into the ""psychedelic"" effects of cannabis, and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in particular, could prove helpful for assessing potential therapeutic indications and elucidating the mechanism of action of both cannabis and classic psychedelics. This review aggregates and evaluates the literature assessing the capacity of cannabis to yield the perceptual changes, aversiveness, and mystical experiences more typically associated with classic psychedelics such as psilocybin. This review also provides a brief contrast of neuroimaging findings associated with the acute effects of cannabis and psychedelics. The available evidence suggests that high-THC cannabis may be able to elicit psychedelic effects, but that these effects may not have been observed in recent controlled research studies due to the doses, set, and settings commonly used. Research is needed to investigate the effects of high doses of THC in the context utilized in therapeutic studies of psychedelics aimed to occasion psychedelic and/or therapeutic experiences. If cannabis can reliably generate psychedelic experiences under these conditions, high-THC dose cannabis treatments should be explored as potential adjunctive treatments for psychiatric disorders and be considered as an active comparator in clinical trials involving traditional psychedelic medications.",0,"[0.9924060702323914, 0.007593900430947542]",0
5456,"Altered pain responses in abstinent (±)3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""ecstasy"") users.^
RATIONALE: (±)3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a popular recreational drug that has potential to damage brain serotonin (5-HT) neurons in humans. Brain 5-HT neurons play a role in pain modulation, yet little is known about long-term effects of MDMA on pain function. Notably, MDMA users have been shown to have altered sleep, a phenomenon that can lead to altered pain modulation. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess pain processing in MDMA users using objective methods, and explore potential relationships between pain processing and sleep indices. METHODS: Forty-two abstinent MDMA users and 43 age-matched controls participated in a 5-day inpatient study. Outcome measures included standardized measures of pain, sleep polysomnograms, and power spectral measures of the sleep EEG. When differences in psychophysiological measures of pain were found, the relationship between pain and sleep measures was explored. RESULTS: MDMA users demonstrated lower pressure pain thresholds, increased cold pain ratings, increased pain ratings during testing of diffuse noxious inhibitory control, and decreased Stage 2 sleep. Numerous significant relationships between sleep and pain measures were identified, but differences in sleep between the two groups were not found to mediate altered pain perception in MDMA users. CONCLUSIONS: Abstinent MDMA users have altered pain perception and sleep architecture. Although pain and sleep outcomes were related, differences in sleep architecture in MDMA users did not mediate altered pain responses. It remains to be determined whether alterations in pain perception in MDMA users are secondary to neurotoxicity of 5-HT-mediated pain pathways or alterations in other brain processes that modulate pain perception.",1,"[0.0027825424913316965, 0.9972174167633057]",1
8561,"Prevalence of self-reported movement dysfunction among young adults with a history of ecstasy and methamphetamine use.^
BACKGROUND: Illicit stimulant use is associated with long-lasting changes in movement and movement-related brain regions. The aim of our study was to investigate the prevalence of movement dysfunction in this population. We hypothesized that prevalence of self-reported movement dysfunction is higher among stimulant users than non-stimulant users. METHODS: Three groups of adults completed a survey containing questions about demographics, health, drug use, and movement. The groups consisted of ecstasy users with no history of methamphetamine use (ecstasy group, n = 190, 20 ± 3 yrs.), methamphetamine users (methamphetamine group, n = 331, 23 ± 5 yrs.), and non-stimulant users (control group, n = 228, 25 ± 8 yrs.). Movement data was analyzed with logistic regression. RESULTS: In the unadjusted logistic regression model, group had a significant effect on fine hand control, tremor, and voice/speech questions, but not on other movement domain questions. The prevalence of tremor and abnormal fine hand control was significantly higher in the ecstasy and methamphetamine groups than in the control group (p < 0.018), and changes in voice/speech was more prevalent in the ecstasy group than in the control group (p = 0.015). Age and use of cannabis and hallucinogens were confounding variables. However, inspection of chi-square tables suggests that the effect of these parameters on the movement data is likely to be minor. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of self-reported tremor and changes in fine hand control and voice/speech is significantly higher in stimulant users than in non-stimulant users. Inclusion of these common and noticeable changes in body function may aid public health campaigns that target prevention or harm minimization.",1,"[0.0029047385323792696, 0.9970952272415161]",1
483,"Chronic stress pathology and ketamine-induced alterations in functional connectivity in major depressive disorder: An abridged review of the clinical evidence.^
A paradigm shift in the conceptualization of the neurobiology of depression and the serendipitous discovery of ketamine's rapid-acting antidepressant (RAAD) effects has ushered in a new era of innovative research and novel drug development. Since the initial discovery of ketamine's RAAD effects, multiple studies have supported its short-term efficacy for fast-tracked improvements in treatment-resistant depression. Evidence from MRI studies have repeatedly demonstrated functional connectivity alterations in stress- and trauma-related disorders suggesting this may be a viable biomarker of chronic stress pathology (CSP). Human mechanistic studies further support this by coupling functional connectivity to ketamine's RAAD effects including connectivity to glutamate neurotransmission, ketamine to normalized connectivity, and these advantageous normalizations to symptom improvement/ketamine response. This review provides an abridged discussion of the suspected neurobiological underpinnings of ketamine's RAAD effects, highlighting ketamine-induced alterations in prefrontal, striatal, and anterior cingulate cortex functional connectivity in major depressive disorder. We present a model of CSP underscoring the role of synaptic loss and dysconnectivity and discuss how ketamine may be used both as (1) a treatment to restore and normalize these stress-induced neural alterations and (2) a tool to study potential biomarkers of CSP and treatment response. We conclude by noting challenges and future directions including heterogeneity, sex differences, the role of early life stress, and the need for proliferation of new methods, paradigms, and tools that will optimize signal and allow analyses at different levels of complexity, according to the needs of the question at hand, perhaps by thinking hierarchically about both clinical and biological phenotypes.",0,"[0.9945573806762695, 0.005442627239972353]",0

Material and methods In this cross-sectional study, we included all patients infected with HIV who visited a tertiary care hospital in Korea from January 1990 to May 2020. Sociodemographic data of patients, including drug use, were collected at the first visit and during follow-up. Results Among 1,267 patients, 5.13% reported the use of an illicit drug in their lifetime, and 2.61% were users of injection drugs. The most commonly used drugs were cannabis/marijuana and methamphetamine, followed by nitrite inhalants, cocaine, dextromethorphan, carisoprodol, and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine. The illicit drug users tended to be younger than non-users, homosexuals/bisexuals, and infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV); they had a higher CD4+ cell count than non-users. Among 65 users of illicit drugs, only 24.6% revealed their drug use at the first visit interview, and 24.6% reported using two or more drugs in their lifetime. Individuals who used injection drugs were more likely to be arrested for drug-related charges than the users of non-injection drugs. Moreover, they tended to be heavy users of illicit drugs, to report using two or more drugs in their lifetime, and to be HCV seropositive. In contrast, the users of non-injection drugs were more likely to be experimental users and to start using drugs overseas for the first time, but less likely to report their drug use at the first interview. Conclusions The prevalence of illicit drug use in people with HIV infection in Korea may have been underestimated.

272,"The effect of ketamine on preventing postpartum depression.^
Postpartum depression is a common disabling psychosocial disorder that could have adverse effects on the life of the mother, infant, and family. The present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of ketamine on preventing postpartum depression in women undergoing caesarian sections considering the relatively known positive effect of ketamine on major depression. The present double-blind, randomized clinical trial was conducted on 134 women undergoing scheduled caesarian sections. Participants were randomly allocated into two groups of control and intervention. To induce anesthesia, 1-2 mg/kg of body weight of Nesdonal and 0.5 mg/kg of body weight of ketamine were used in the intervention group, while only 3-5 mg/kg of body weight Nesdonal was administered in the control group. Data were gathered using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) in three stages: before the caesarian section and two and four weeks after the caesarian section. Data were analyzed using variance analysis with repeated measures and the Chi-square test.

4632,"The novel psychoactive phenetylamine 4-fluoroamphetamine produces a mild psychedelic state without affecting creative thinking.^
The phenetylamine 4‐fluoroamphetamine (4‐FA) is a so‐called novel psychoactive substance with a chemical structure that resembles that of amphetamine and MDMA [1]. Since 4‐FA users report the subjective experience to range between that induced by amphetamine and MDMA, and it is known both substances can produce an altered state of consciousness, it will be tested whether 4‐FA induces a similar state. In addition, dissociative states have been linked with increased creativity or creative thinking [2]. In light of the renewed interest in psychedelics as therapeutic tools in the treatment of psychopathologies like depression and anxiety disorders, where rigid thinking is one of the hallmarks, it is important to test whether this new compound can induce flexible thinking. A placebo‐controlled 2‐way crossover study in twelve healthy poly‐drug users was conducted to test subjective and behavioral effects of 4‐FA (100 mg). The 100 mg dose was based on a user survey amongst Dutch 4‐FA users. The majority of the users who knew which dose they ingest typically indicated it to be between 50‐150 mg [1]. Subjective effects were tested by means of the Bowdle Visual Analogue Scale, the Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale, the Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale and the Hallucinogenic Rating Scale. Convergent and divergent thinking was assessed by means of the Picture Concept test (PCT). Both subjective and objective measures have previously been shown to be sensitive to the effects of stimulants and/or psychedelic substances [3,4]. Measurements took place 1‐to‐11 hours post‐administration. 4‐FA concentrations were determined in serum up to 12 hours after administration. Findings showed that 4‐FA induced a psychedelic state which was highest 1 hour after 4‐FA administration, around 4‐FA peak serum concentrations. The 4‐FA‐induced psychedelic state decreased over time. There was no effect of 4‐FA on creative thinking. While the hypothesis that 4‐FA would induce a psychedelic state that can be categorized in between that produced by amphetamine and MDMA was confirmed, the hypothesized effect on divergent thinking could not be confirmed. Although not statistically significant, it was interesting to see that convergent thinking was increased 6 hours after intake compared to placebo, while divergent thinking performance was placebo‐like. This pattern is opposite to the previously demonstrated ayahuasca effect where two hours after intake convergent thinking was decreased by 15% compared to baseline and divergent thinking was increased by approximately 20% [4]. To confirm the absence or presence of 4‐FA effects on creative thinking, future research needs to include creative performance tests at different time points in the serum curve. In addition, creative thinking should then also be assessed in proximity with the peak of dissociative effects to test whether both are associated as suggested by previous studies linking dissociative states and creativity [3]. It is concluded that while the 4‐FA‐induced psychedelic state is mild in intensity and in between that of amphetamine and MDMA as hypothesized, more research is needed to (in) validate whether 4‐FA can change creative thinking.",1,"[0.036994557827711105, 0.9630054831504822]",1

Background: Ketamine, a N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, may reduce postoperative opioid demand and improve postoperative analgesia. Methods: Sixty-nine patients scheduled for lumbar disk surgery under general anaesthesia were enrolled in a randomised, double-blind study comparing three analgesic combinations that were started before surgical incision: morphine 0.1 mg kg-1 alone (group M; n = 23); ketamine 0.15 mg kg-1 alone (group K; n = 22); and a combination of morphine 0.1 mg kg-1 with ketamine 0.15 mg kg-1 (group KM; n = 23). Postoperatively patient-controlled analgesia was provided with intravenous morphine. Morphine consumption was assessed during 24 H, and pain scores were measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS) at rest and on mobilisation, during the first two postoperative days. Results: In group KM, less i.v. morphine was administered in the post anaesthesia care unit than in group M (median [range]: 0 mg [0-2] vs. 7 mg [6-9], P = 0.009). Cumulative 24 H morphine consumption was reduced by 57% in group KM vs. group M, and by 48% in group KM vs. group K. Postoperative VAS scores were lower in group KM vs. groups K and M. Maximal VAS score on mobilization was reduced in group KM compared to groups K and M (38 mm [35-45] vs. 52 mm [48-59] and vs. 59 mm [55-64], in groups KM, K and M, respectively, P = 0.05 and P = 0.002).

Recent preliminary evidence has also demonstrated that psychedelic administration can enhance mindfulness capacities which has already been demonstrated robustly as a result of mindfulness-based interventions. These shared mechanisms between mindfulness-based interventions and psychedelic therapy have led to scientists theorising, and recently demonstrating, synergistic effects when both are used in combination, in the form of potentiated therapeutic benefit.

In the current report, blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal was collected during music listening in 25 healthy adults after administration of placebo, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and LSD pretreated with the 5HT2A antagonist ketanserin, to investigate the role of 5HT2A receptor signaling in the neural response to the time-varying tonal structure of music. Tonality-tracking analysis of BOLD data revealed that 5HT2A receptor signaling alters the neural response to music in brain regions supporting basic and higher-level musical and auditory processing, and areas involved in memory, emotion, and self-referential processing. This suggests a critical role of 5HT2A receptor signaling in supporting the neural tracking of dynamic tonal structure in music, as well as in supporting the associated increases in emotionality, connectedness, and meaningfulness in response to music that are commonly observed after the administration of LSD and other psychedelics. Together, these findings inform the neuropsychopharmacology of music perception and cognition, meaningful music listening experiences, and altered perception of music during psychedelic experiences.",1,"[0.003426528302952647, 0.9965734481811523]",1
2498,"Behavioral characterization of ayahuasca treatment on Wistar rats in the open field test.^
Ayahuasca (AYA) is a psychedelic beverage with therapeutic potential for many mood and anxiety disorders. Although there are some preclinical studies, no published reports have tested the behavioral effects of AYA gavage in animal models. This investigation aimed to characterize the behavior of Wistar rats after acute ingestion of AYA for 40 min in the open field test (OFT). The sample consisted of three experimental groups treated with different dosages of AYA (125, 250, or 500 mg kg-1) and a control group. Each group consisted of 10 participants. After gavage, the number of crossings of the OFT grid lines, latency to enter the central area of the device, grooming frequency, and time spent in the central perimeter of the device were immediately evaluated. Analyses were based on one-way ANOVA and a linear-regression mixture model for longitudinal data. AYA intake did not interfere with habituation. The 500 mg kg-1 group showed a decrease in the time spent in the center of the device and in the number of crossings compared to the control group in the last 10 min. These results suggest that gavage with AYA did not interfere with the results, and the behavioral effects were perceived only between 30 and 40 min after gavage. Taken together, the results indicate that three aspects should be considered in OFT studies of AYA acute effects: the moment when the observation starts, the observation period, and the AYA dosage.",0,"[0.9924817681312561, 0.007518190890550613]",0

1466,"Survey of substance use among adolescent drug offenders referred from juvenile courts in Taiwan: Clinical epidemiology of single versus multiple illicit substance use.^
Background: Substance use during adolescence might cause substantial health burden. Little is known regarding profiles of multiple illicit substance users compared to single illicit substance users in adolescent population in Taiwan. Methods: We enrolled 106 adolescent illicit drug users who received addiction treatment referred by juvenile courts in Taiwan between September, 2016 and September, 2021. We divided them into two groups: single versus multiple illicit drug users, and further compared their socio-demographic characteristics, psychiatric and substance comorbidities. The independent t test or Mann–Whitney U test was used for continuous variables and Pearson's chi-square test for nominal variables. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the suicide and violence risk among adolescents. Results: 71.7% of participants were multiple illicit drug users while 28.3% of them were single drug users. Multiple illicit substance users were more likely to use methamphetamine (p = 0.005), ketamine (p < 0.001), new psychoactive substance (NPS) (p < 0.001), MDMA (p = 0.003), and nitrous oxide (p < 0.001) compared to single illicit substance users. In addition, multiple illicit drug users were more likely to have ADHD (p = 0.030), major depressive disorder (p = 0.050), and lifetime suicidal attempts (p = 0.048) compared to single illicit drug users. In further analysis (NPS vs. traditional drugs), we found NPS users tended to use larger numbers of illicit drugs (p < 0.001) and were more likely to have substance-induced psychotic disorder (p = 0.008), ADHD (p = 0.011), suicidal attempts (p = 0.020). Conclusion: Our findings highlight the distinct profiles of multiple illicit drug users compared to single illicit drug users among adolescent population. High suicidality and high psychiatric comorbidities in multiple illicit drug users call for special need for suicide screening and a more integrated care incorporating psychiatric and substance treatment.",0,"[0.9647995829582214, 0.03520045429468155]",1
5903,"Adolescents are more sensitive than adults to acute behavioral and cognitive effects of THC.^
Increased cannabis availability has contributed to increased use with concomitant incidence of adverse effects. One risk factor for adverse drug reactions may be age. There is preclinical evidence that acute effects of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary active constituent of cannabis, are greater during adolescence, but this has not been fully studied in humans. The present study sought to determine whether adolescent men and women are more sensitive than adults to acute THC. Adolescents aged 18-20 (N = 12) and adults aged 30-40 (N = 12), with less than 20 total lifetime uses of THC-containing products, received capsules of THC (7.5, 15 mg) and placebo across three study sessions in randomized order under double blind conditions. During each session, subjective, cardiovascular, behavioral, and EEG measures were obtained. Behavioral measures included Simple Reaction Time, Stop Task, Time Production and N-back and EEG measures included P300 amplitudes during an auditory oddball task and eyes-closed resting state. THC affected subjective state and heart rate similarly in both age groups. However, adolescents were more sensitive to performance impairing effects, exhibiting dose-dependent impairments on reaction time, response accuracy, and time perception. On EEG measures, THC dose-dependently decreased P300 amplitude in adolescents but not adults. Adolescents were more sensitive to behavioral and cognitive effects of THC, but not to cardiovascular effects or subjective measures. Thus, at doses that produce comparable ratings of intoxication, adolescents may exhibit greater cognitive impairment and alterations in brain function.",0,"[0.991456925868988, 0.008543087169528008]",0

5804,"Greater vulnerability to the amnestic effects of ketamine in males.^
RATIONALE: Gender differences both in response to ketamine in animals and general cognitive functioning in humans have been observed and suggested to be related to modulatory effects of sex hormones on N-methyl-D: -aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) functioning. OBJECTIVES: The current study aimed to determine whether there were gender differences in response to ketamine in humans. METHODS: Behavioral data including positive and negative symptoms (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale), perceptual alterations (Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale, CADSS), and ""high"" and ""anxiety"" states (Visual Analog Scale) from 295 subjects who participated in a total of 11 placebo-controlled ketamine studies were analyzed. In a subset of subjects, memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Task: HVLT, n=108) and attention (continuous performance task, n=177) data were also analyzed. RESULTS: Male participants showed a greater performance decrement on the HVLT after ketamine administration compared to women. Men also reported a greater subjective sense of memory impairment on a CADSS subscale. No other gender differences in behavioral or cognitive measures were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Men showed a greater vulnerability to the amnestic effects of ketamine than women. Possible explanations of these findings are neuroanatomical and cognitive differences in processing of words in men and women and interactions between sex hormones and NMDA-R function.",1,"[0.0025342421140521765, 0.9974657297134399]",1
563,"Parsing the heterogeneity of depression: An exploratory factor analysis across commonly used depression rating scales.^
Background: Due to the heterogeneity of depressive symptoms—which can include depressed mood, anhedonia, negative cognitive biases, and altered activity levels—researchers often use a combination of depression rating scales to assess symptoms. This study sought to identify unidimensional constructs measured across rating scales for depression and to evaluate these constructs across clinical trials of a rapid-acting antidepressant (ketamine). Methods: Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted on baseline ratings from the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Rating Scale (SHAPS). Inpatients with major depressive disorder (n = 76) or bipolar depression (n = 43) were participating in clinical ketamine trials. The trajectories of the resulting unidimensional scores were evaluated in 41 subjects with bipolar depression who participated in clinical ketamine trials. Results: The best solution, which exhibited excellent fit to the data, comprised eight factors: Depressed Mood, Tension, Negative Cognition, Impaired Sleep, Suicidal Thoughts, Reduced Appetite, Anhedonia, and Amotivation. Various response patterns were observed across the clinical trial data, both in treatment effect (ketamine versus placebo) and in degree of placebo response, suggesting that use of these unidimensional constructs may reveal patterns not observed with traditional scoring of individual instruments. Limitations: Limitations include: 1) small sample (and related inability to confirm measurement invariance); 2) absence of an independent sample for confirmation of factor structure; and 3) the treatment-resistant nature of the population, which may limit generalizability. Conclusions: The empirical identification of unidimensional constructs creates more refined scores that may elucidate the connection between specific symptoms and underlying pathophysiology.

A sensitive and robust ultra high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for quantification of amphetamine, methamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine and 3,4-methylenedioxy methamphetamine in hair samples. Segmented hair (10mg) was incubated in 2M sodium hydroxide (80°C, 10min) before liquid-liquid extraction with isooctane followed by centrifugation and evaporation of the organic phase to dryness. The residue was reconstituted in methanol:formate buffer pH 3 (20:80). The total run time was 4min and after optimization of UHPLC-MS/MS-parameters validation included selectivity, matrix effects, recovery, process efficiency, calibration model and range, lower limit of quantification, precision and bias. The calibration curve ranged from 0.02 to 12.5ng/mg, and the recovery was between 62 and 83%. During validation the bias was less than ±7% and the imprecision was less than 5% for all analytes. In routine analysis, fortified control samples demonstrated an imprecision <13% and control samples made from authentic hair demonstrated an imprecision <26%. The method was applied to samples from a controlled study of amphetamine intake as well as forensic hair samples previously analyzed with an ultra high performance liquid chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-TOF-MS) screening method. The proposed method was suitable for quantification of these drugs in forensic cases including violent crimes, autopsy cases, drug testing and re-granting of driving licences. This study also demonstrated that if hair samples are divided into several short segments, the time point for intake of a small dose of amphetamine can be estimated, which might be useful when drug facilitated crimes are investigated. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",0,"[0.991532027721405, 0.008467906154692173]",0
8428,"Hair analysis by using radioimmunoassay, high-performance liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis to investigate chronic exposure to heroin, cocaine and/or ecstasy in applicants for driving licences.^
The present paper describes an integrated diagnostic strategy to check the physical fitness of subjects, formerly users of illicit drugs, to obtain a driving licence, after having quit their addiction. According to the Italian law, applicants for a driving licence with a history of drug abuse must give evidence to have quit this behaviour and to show no risk of relapse in the future. To prove this, at our institute, they undergo medical examination, hair analysis and a urinalysis program on eight seriate samples, collected over about 40 days. About 700 subjects per year are investigated with this strategy. The hair samples are screened for opiates (morphine), cocaine and ecstasy, the most abused illicit substances in our region, by using commercial radioimmunoassays adopting cut-off levels of 0.1 ng/mg. All positive samples and about 10% of negatives are confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Further confirmation of results can be carried out by capillary electrophoresis (and/or GC/MS or MS/MS). In 1998, the prevalence of positives for morphine, cocaine and ecstasy was 4.8, 11.3 and 2.6%, respectively. In this year, for the first time, the percentage of hair samples positive for cocaine was greater than that for opiates. The results of this integrated diagnostic strategy are presented and discussed, with particular emphasis on the comparison between hair analysis on a single sample and seriate urinalyses (on eight samples).

Four randomized, controlled studies were identified. Two were excluded due to poor quality. Both included studies concluded that ketamine improves morphine treatment in cancer pain. Quantitative meta-analysis was not possible. The available evidence is not sufficient to conclude that ketamine improves the effectiveness of opioid treatment in cancer pain.

705,"Demographic Features, Physical Examination Findings, and Medication Use in Hospitalized, Delirious Patients With and Without COVID-19 Infection: A Retrospective Study.^
Background: Delirium is common in the setting of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Anecdotal evidence and case reports suggest that patients with delirium in the setting of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) may exhibit specific features, including increased tone, abulia, and alogia. Objective: To determine whether differences exist in sociodemographic and medical characteristics, physical examination findings, and medication use in delirious patients with and without COVID-19 infection referred for psychiatric consultation. Methods: We undertook an exploratory, retrospective chart review of 486 patients seen by the psychiatry consultation service at a tertiary care hospital from March 10 to May 15, 2020. Delirious patients were diagnosed via clinical examination by a psychiatric consultant, and these patients were stratified by COVID-19 infection status. The strata were described and compared using bivariate analyses across sociodemographic, historical, objective, and treatment-related variables. Results: A total of 109 patients were diagnosed with delirium during the study period. Thirty-six were COVID-19+. Median age was 63 years and did not differ between groups. COVID-19+ patients with delirium were more likely to present from nursing facilities (39% vs 11%; Fisher's exact test; P = 0.001) and have a history of schizophrenia (11% vs 0%; Fisher's exact test; P = 0.011). Myoclonus (28% vs 4%; P = 0.002), hypertonia (36% vs 10%; P = 0.003), withdrawal (36% vs 15%; P = 0.011), akinesia (19% vs 6%; P = 0.034), abulia (19% vs 3%; P = 0.004), and alogia (25% vs 8%; P = 0.012) were more common in COVID-19+ patients. COVID-19+ delirious patients were significantly more likely to have received ketamine (28% vs 7%; P = 0.006), alpha-adrenergic agents besides dexmedetomidine (36% vs 14%; P = 0.014), and enteral antipsychotics (92% vs 66%; P = 0.007) at some point. Conclusions: Patients with COVID-19 delirium referred for psychiatric consultation are more likely to reside in nursing facilities and have a history of schizophrenia than delirious patients without COVID-19. Patients with delirium in the setting of COVID-19 may exhibit features consistent with akinetic mutism. Psychiatrists must assess for such features, as they may influence management choices and the risk of side effects with agents commonly used in the setting of delirium.",0,"[0.9750451445579529, 0.02495483309030533]",0
7601,"MDMA (Ecstasy) association with impaired fMRI BOLD thalamic coherence and functional connectivity.^
BACKGROUND: MDMA exposure is associated with chronic serotonergic dysfunction in preclinical and clinical studies. A recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) comparison of past MDMA users to non-MDMA-using controls revealed increased spatial extent and amplitude of activation in the supplementary motor area during motor tasks (Karageorgiou et al., 2009). Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) data from that study were reanalyzed for intraregional coherence and for inter-regional temporal correlations between time series, as functional connectivity. METHODS: Fourteen MDMA users and ten controls reporting similar non-MDMA abuse performed finger taps during fMRI. Fourteen motor pathway regions plus a pontine raphé region were examined. Coherence was expressed as percent of voxels positively correlated with an intraregional index voxel. Functional connectivity was determined using wavelet correlations. RESULTS: Intraregional thalamic coherence was significantly diminished at low frequencies in MDMA users compared to controls (p=0.009). Inter-regional functional connectivity was significantly weaker for right thalamo - left caudate (p=0.002), right thalamo - left thalamus (p=0.007), right caudate - right postcentral (p=0.007) and right supplementary motor area - right precentral gyrus (p=0.011) region pairs compared to controls. When stratified by lifetime exposure, significant negative associations were observed between cumulative MDMA use and functional connectivity in seven other region-pairs, while only one region-pair showed a positive association. CONCLUSIONS: Reported prior MDMA use was associated with deficits in BOLD intraregional coherence and inter-regional functional connectivity, even among functionally robust pathways involving motor regions. This suggests that MDMA use is associated with long-lasting effects on brain neurophysiology beyond the cognitive domain.",1,"[0.0028158510103821754, 0.9971840977668762]",1
2243,"Risk assessment of ayahuasca use in a religious context: Self-reported risk factors and adverse effects.^
Objective: Whether for spiritual, recreational, or potential therapeutic use, interest in ayahuasca has grown remarkably. Ayahuasca’s main active substances are N,N-dimethyltryptamine and certain mono-amine oxidase inhibitor b-carbolines. Possible drug interactions are a major concern, and research is lacking in this area. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of ritual ayahuasca use regarding adverse effects and risk factors. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, ayahuasca users from a religious institution answered an online questionnaire about its safety. Adverse effects, safety measures, and possible risk factors (psychiatric diagnosis and medications) were investigated. Results: The most frequent adverse effects among the 614 participants were transient gastrointestinal effects (nausea and vomiting). Fifty participants self-reported a psychiatric diagnosis (depression and anxiety were the most prevalent), and these participants experienced adverse effects more frequently. Psychiatric medication use was reported by 31 participants. No indication of increased adverse effects due to drug-drug interactions was found. Conclusion: A minority of participants reported being very negatively affected by persistent adverse effects. Psychiatric medication use while participating in ayahuasca rituals was not associated with increased adverse effects. For the most part, the institution’s practices seem sufficient to prevent exacerbated reactions.

2953,"Nicotine patch for cannabis withdrawal symptom relief: a randomized controlled trial.^
RATIONALE: Given that tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and nicotine have similar effects on negative affect (NA), we hypothesized that a 7‐mg nicotine patch (NP) would reduce NA‐related cannabis (CAN) withdrawal symptoms in cannabis‐dependent (CD) individuals who were not nicotine dependent. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether NP reduces NA across 15 days of CAN abstinence in two groups: non‐tobacco smokers (NTS) and light tobacco smokers (LTS). METHODS: CD participants (N = 127; aged 18‐35) who used CAN at least 5 times/week for the past 12 + months were randomized to (1) NP or (2) a placebo patch (PP) and received $300 for sustained biochemically verified CAN abstinence. Of those randomly assigned, 52 of 63 NP, and 56 of 64 PP maintained biochemically verified CAN abstinence and 51 NP and 50 PP participants complied with all aspects of the study. Affect and other withdrawal symptoms were measured every 48 h across 15 days of CAN abstinence. RESULTS: After controlling for age, tobacco use, baseline THC concentration, and baseline measurements of the dependent variable, NP reduced NA symptoms across the 15‐day treatment relative to PP. Differences in NA and CAN withdrawal symptoms were not moderated by tobacco user status. CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide the first evidence that NP may be able to attenuate NA‐related withdrawal symptoms in individuals with cannabis use disorder who are not heavy users of tobacco or nicotine.

In the striatum, there was a marked heterogeneous patterning of 5-HT uptake sites that corresponded to the striosomal/matrix compartmentalization of the striatum. This organization was not matched with an equally heterogeneous pattern of either 5-HT2 or 5-HT(1A) receptors. For the isocortex, a general organizational scheme was observed with the 5-HT(1A) receptor expression high in the external laminae and deep laminae, but 5-HT2 receptor expression was higher in the internal laminae. There was a laminar distribution of 5-HT uptake sites that approximated the combined distributions of the 5-HT(1A) receptor and the 5-HT2 receptor. In the parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus, the distribution of 5-HT uptake sites was complementary to the distribution of 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT2 receptors. In schizophrenic cases, there was a large increase in the number and altered striosomal/matrix organization of 5-HT uptake sites in the striatum. There was also an increase in the numbers of 5-HT2 receptors in the nucleus accumbens and ventral putamen of the schizophrenics. The number of 5-HT(1A) receptors was not modified.

9419,"Cognitive and motor effects of NMDA antagonist ketamine in healthy individuals with a family history of alcoholism.^
The cognitive and motor effects of alcohol drinking are influenced by a family history of alcoholism. Some data suggest that individuals with a family history of alcoholism(family history positive [FHP]) are less affected and intoxicated by alcohol, as compared to those without such a history (family history negative [FHN]). Our group has used ketamine as a pharmacological probe to study alcoholism, since (a) both alcohol and ketamine inhibit N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor function and (b) ketamine has alcohol‐like effects. The purpose of the study was to evaluate cognitive and motor effects of ketamine in FHP and FHN subjects. Ninety‐nine non‐alcohol‐dependent healthy subjects with (FHP; n = 29) and without a family history of alcoholism(FHN; n = 70) were recruited. The subjects weremales and females aged 21 to 30 years who had no lifetime Axis I psychiatric or substance use disorders. In this randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, crossover study, subjects received either intravenous ketamine (0.81 mg/kg) or placebo (saline) during two separate test sessions scheduled 3 days apart. Cognitive function was evaluated by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test. Motor coordination function was evaluated by the Grooved Pegboard Test. During the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, ketamine impaired both total recall (medication effect: p < 0.0001) and delayed recall (medication effect: p < 0.0001) compared with placebo. There was a statistical trend (family history x medication effect: p = 0.0667) showing that FHP subjects (placebo: 10.3; ketamine: 7.7) were less impaired than FHN subjects (placebo: 10.2; ketamine: 6.2) in delayed recall after ketamine infusion. During the Grooved Pegboard Test, ketamine impaired motor coordination in both dominant hand (medication x time effect: p < 0.0001) and non‐dominant hand (medication x time effect: p < 0.0001) compared with placebo. There was a statistical trend (family history x medication x time effect: p = 0.0596) showing that FHP subjects (pre‐ketamine: 59.8 sec; post‐ketamine: 81.8 sec) were less impaired than FHN subjects (pre‐ketamine: 59.5 sec; post‐ketamine: 92.9 sec) in motor coordination performance after ketamine infusion (in dominant hand).

814,"Decision-making in chronic ecstasy users: a systematic review.^
Different cognitive impairments have been reported as a result of long-term MDMA/ecstasy use. Increased impulsivity and altered decision-making have been shown to be associated with the development and maintenance of addictive disorders pointing toward the necessity to understand a potential impairment of decision-making due to MDMA use. Thus, assessing the long-term effects of MDMA is crucial in order to evaluate its controversially discussed therapeutic use. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the scientific literature on potential effects of chronic MDMA use on higher order decision-making processes in humans. Therefore, a systematic search for controlled trials relevant to the topic has been performed. Only studies using specific tasks on decision-making were included that involved subjects in the drug-free interval with drug-naïve, and/or polydrug control groups. A total of 12 studies could be identified that met the inclusion criteria, all of which were cross-sectional studies. The findings on decision-making disturbances in MDMA users were heterogeneous. Seven studies reported increased risky decisions, whereas five studies did not find MDMA-specific influences on decision-making. Increased impulsivity was observed both in MDMA groups and in (poly)drug control groups in almost all studies. Thus, the current state of research does not allow for the conclusion that long-term use of MDMA affects decision-making behavior in general. More detailed specifications as well as further investigations of the relevant processes are needed.

Twenty‐six in‐patients with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual version IV (DSM‐IV) criteria for opioid dependence were selected at random to receive either a combination of an 11‐day low‐dose buprenorphine and a 14‐day carbamazepine regimen (n = 14) or a combination of an 11‐day methadone and a 14‐day carbamazepine regimen (n = 12) in a double‐blind, randomized 14‐day in‐patient detoxification treatment. Patients with buprenorphine and carbamazepine showed a significantly better psychological state after the first and second weeks of treatment. Above all, the buprenorphine‐treated patients demonstrated a less marked tiredness, sensitiveness and depressive state as well as a more prominent elevated mood during the detoxification process. Seven non‐completers (after 7 days: four of 12 = 33.3%; after 14 days: seven of 12 = 58.3%) were treated with methadone and carbamazepine and five non‐completers (after 7 days: two of 14 = 14.3%; after 14 days: five of 14 = 35.7%) received buprenorphine and carbamazepine. The difference in the overall dropout rate after day 14 was not significant. The present study supports the hypothesis that the combination of buprenorphine and carbamazepine leads to a better clinical outcome than does a combination of methadone and carbamazepine in the detoxification of opioid addicts with additional multiple drug abuse. The buprenorphine and carbamazepine‐regimen provides a more effective short‐term relief of affective disturbances than does methadone and carbamazepine. No severe side effects occurred during the treatment period in both groups.",0,"[0.9795310497283936, 0.020468898117542267]",0

Two ultralight general anesthetic techniques, one using low-dose ketamine and the other using methohexital as the primary anesthetic agent, were compared for efficacy, safety, and psychomotor recovery in a double-blind fashion for use during third molar surgery. Low-dose intravenous ketamine as the primary anesthetic following premedication with fentanyl and midazolam, and in conjunction with nitrous oxide, appeared to produce less hypoxia, hypercarbia, and apnea than when methohexital was used. No significant differences were noted in heart rate or blood pressure between the techniques. The ketamine technique was universally preferred by the surgeons and anesthesiologists because of superior patient cooperation and airway management. No unpleasant psychomimetic side effects of significance were noted with the use of ketamine.

3089,"Ketamine mechanism of action: Separating the wheat from the chaff.^
This article discusses the mechanism of action of ketamine. Ketamine exerts rapid and robust antidepressant effects in severely ill-depressed patients who have failed conventional treatments. This clinical finding has been paradigm-shifting as there is now tremendous hope that very ill-depressed patients can be treated in a matter of hours, rather than many weeks or months required for standard therapies to take effect. However, although the therapeutic potential of ketamine has elicited tremendous excitement in the field, ketamine’s use outside of a monitored clinic setting is limited due to its anesthetic actions at higher doses, abuse liability, ataxic effects, and capacity to produce changes in sensation and dissociation even when administered at sub-anesthetic antidepressant- effective doses. Ketamine’s antidepressant action had been presumed to be via its anesthetic target, which is the inhibition of the NMDA glutamate receptor. Ketamine is rapidly metabolized in the liver via multiple cytochrome P450 isoforms to norketamine, dehydronorketamine, hydroxyketamines, and a number of hydroxynorketamines (HNKs) in a stereoselective manner. Validation of the relevance of HNK metabolites to the clinical antidepressant actions of ketamine in humans will require human clinical trials, which are currently in preparation.

8421,"MDMA exposure alters cognitive and electrophysiological sensitivity to rapid tryptophan depletion in rhesus monkeys.^
Repeated treatment with ()3,4-methylenedioylymethamphetamine (MDMA) produces lasting depletions in serotonin (5-HT) markers in the brains of New and Old World monkeys. We have previously shown that macaques treated with MDMA (4 days, 10 mg/kg im, b.i.d.), exhibit an immediate, similar to50% reduction of the 5-HT metabolite 5-hydroxymdoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and 76-93% reductions in neocortical 5-HT content postmortem, but no lasting behavioral deficits under unchallenged conditions. Those monkeys were, however, more behaviorally sensitive to challenge with the 5-HT2C agonist 1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine (mCPP) I year after the NMMA regimen. A rapid tryptophan-depletion protocol was employed to determine further if these MDMA-exposed monkeys are more behaviorally and electrophysiologically sensitive to perturbation of 5-HT neurotransmission. Acute intragastric administration of a tryptophan-deficient (TRYP-) mixture of amino acids resulted in significant reductions in CSF 5-HIAA in both MDMA-exposed and control monkeys. The TRYP- mixture also reduced the brainstem auditory-evoked potential (BSAEP) P4 latency in MDMA-exposed monkeys, similar to an effect observed for 13 weeks post-MDMA. Spatial working memory performance was improved by the TRYP- mixture in the control group, but not the NDMA-exposed monkeys. Other behavioral capabilities [visual recognition memory, reaction time (RT), reinforcer efficacy and fine motor control] were not significantly affected by the TRYP- mixture in either group of monkeys. Thus, underlying alterations in brain function resulting from prior exposure to MDMA, that were not observed under normal conditions, may be revealed following perturbation of 5-HT signaling. The BSAEP response and spatial working memory appear particularly sensitive to lasting functional differences associated with MDMA exposure. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

8038,"Motor delays in MDMA (ecstasy) exposed infants persist to 2 years.^
Background: Recreational use of 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy, MDMA) is increasing worldwide. Its use by pregnant women causes concern due to potentially harmful effects on the developing fetus. MDMA, an indirect monoaminergic agonist and reuptake inhibitor, affects the serotonin and dopamine systems. Preclinical studies of fetal exposure demonstrate effects on learning, motor behavior, and memory. In the first human studies, we found prenatal MDMA exposure related to poorer motor development in the first year of life. In the present study we assessed the effects of prenatal exposure to MDMA on the trajectory of child development through 2 years of age. We hypothesized that exposure would be associated with poorer mental and motor outcomes. Materials and Methods: The DAISY (Drugs and Infancy Study, 2003-2008) employed a prospective longitudinal cohort design to assess recreational drug use during pregnancy and child outcomes in the United Kingdom. Examiners masked to drug exposures followed infants from birth to 4, 12, 18, and 24 months of age. MDMA, cocaine, alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, and other drugs were quantified through a standardized clinical interview. The Bayley Scales (III) of Mental (MDI) and Motor (PDI) Development and the Behavior Rating Scales (BRS) were primary outcome measures. Statistical analyses included a repeated measures mixed model approach controlling for multiple confounders. Results: Participants were pregnant women volunteers, primarily white, of middle class socioeconomic status, average IQ, with some college education, in stable partner relationships. Of 96 women enrolled, children of 93 had at least one follow-up assessment and 81 (87%) had ≥ two assessments. Heavier MDMA exposure (= 1.3 ± 1.4 tablets per week) predicted lower PDI (< .002), and poorer BRS motor quality from 4 to 24 months of age, but did not affect MDI, orientation, or emotional regulation. Children with heavier exposure were twice as likely to demonstrate poorer motor quality as lighter and non-exposed children (O.R. = 2.2, 95%, CI = 1.02-4.70, p < .05). Discussion: Infants whose mothers reported heavier MDMA use during pregnancy had motor delays from 4 months to two years of age that were not attributable to other drug or lifestyle factors. Women of child bearing age should be cautioned about the use of MDMA and MDMA-exposed infants should be screened for motor delays and possible intervention.",1,"[0.0033751269802451134, 0.9966249465942383]",1
3097,"Memory performance in polyvalent MDMA (ecstasy) users who continue or discontinue MDMA use.^
Background: The popular dance drug ecstasy (3,4- methylenedioxymethamphetamine = MDMA) is a serotonergic neurotoxin in animal studies. Several cross-sectional investigations reported low memory and learning performance in ecstasy users, particularly in those reporting heavy patterns of drug use. Since, serotonin has a recognized role in memory processes, these findings were mostly interpreted as evidence for ecstasy-related neurotoxicity in humans. However, studies with user populations and controls suffer from many inherent methodological problems. Moreover, longitudinal data on memory performance after continued or discontinued ecstasy use are scarce. Methods: In the present longitudinal study, we examined memory performance in 38 MDMA users over the course of 18 months. Results: Subjects who stopped MDMA use after the baseline examination (n = 17) did not improve, and subjects who continued MDMA use (n = 21) did not deteriorate in terms of test performance. Conclusions: Our data do not support, but they also do not rule out memory decline following use of the serotonergic neurotoxin MDMA. In light of the popularity of ecstasy among young people, further investigations are needed. In our view, research strategies should now move to prospective designs in order to shed more light on the course of possible adverse cognitive effects of ecstasy use. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

7435,"Meta-analysis of short- and mid-term efficacy of ketamine in unipolar and bipolar depression.^
Among treatments currently assessed in major depression, ketamine, has been proposed of great interest, especially because of its very rapid action. However, the time-course of the antidepressive action of ketamine remained unclear. In the present meta-analysis, we provided a clear and objective view regarding the putative antidepressive effect of ketamine and its time-course. We searched the MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases through December 2013, without limits on year of publication, using the key words ketamine and synonyms for mood disorder or episode. Six randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trials of ketamine in major depression (n=103 patients) were thus identified. Authors were contacted and they all provided original data necessary for this meta-analysis. Standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated between the depression scores in ketamine and placebo groups at days 1, 2, 3-4, 7 and 14. Ketamine showed an overall antidepressive efficacy from day 1 to day 7. However, the maintenance of its efficacy over time failed to reach significance in bipolar depression after day 3-4. Significant SMDs were not explained by demographic or clinical characteristics of included samples.

8795,"Psilocybin Therapy for Major Depressive Disorder: A Systematic Review.^
Introduction: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent and complex mood disorder. Its psychotherapies often involve delayed treatment-response times, while its pharmacotherapies can cause unwanted side effects. In recent years, there has been a resurgence in psychedelic research with a specific interest in the potential of psilocybin for treating MDD. Therefore, this systematic review was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of psilocybin therapy at moderate (15±5 mg/70 kg) to high (25 ± 5 mg/70 kg) doses in the psychiatric treatment of MDD. Methods: The review included a literature search using PubMed (Medline), SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Medline (Ovid) databases from January 1, 2013, to February 28, 2023. Seven studies were included following the inclusion and exclusion criteria (e.g., moderate to high dosing psilocybin treatment, peer-reviewed, moderate to severe depression, control/delayed treatment groups, and non-directive therapy during psilocybin sessions). Studies were excluded using PRISMA guidelines and appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklists. Results: The primary outcomes assessed included changes in depression scores on validated diagnostic tools and secondary outcomes that supported depression remission (e.g., improved well-being and rumination scores, and decreased anxiety scores). Psilocybin was found to reduce depression symptoms in moderate single-dose contexts and have minimal reported side effects at high doses. A positive relationship was observed between the quality of psilocybin-induced experiences and the reduction in depressive symptoms. Additionally, a dose-response relationship was found between moderate (15±5 mg/70 kg) and high-dose psilocybin (25 ± 5 mg/70 kg), with greater improvements generally seen in higher dose conditions. Discussion: This review suggests that psilocybin can be an effective treatment option for MDD. Psilocybin shows meaningful improvements in depression scores with the potential to treat psychiatric conditions concurrent to depression. The non-directive therapy approach during high-dose sessions enabled unique psychedelic and personal experiences, potentially allowing more profound and individualized therapy. Reported side effects were minimal, and suggestions for future studies are provided. Conclusion: Psilocybin therapy was found to reduce depression levels and improve secondary outcomes that support depression remission, indicating efficacy for MDD and other depressive conditions. Despite seeming promising, further research is required before introducing PAP options to mainstream clinical practice. © Kaden L. Venugopal. (2023).",1,"[0.002800676506012678, 0.997199296951294]",1
434,"MDMA treatment paired with a trauma-cue promotes adaptive stress responses in a translational model of PTSD in rats.^
MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine), a synthetic ring-substituted amphetamine, combined with psychotherapy has demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients. This controlled prospective study aimed to assess the bio-behavioral underpinnings of MDMA in a translational model of PTSD. Rats exposed to predator-scent stress (PSS) were subjected to a trauma-cue at day 7 shortly after single-dose MDMA injection (5 mg/kg). The elevated plus maze and acoustic startle response tests were assessed on day 14 and served for classification into behavioral response groups. Freezing response to a further trauma-reminder was assessed on Day 15. The morphological characteristics of the dentate gyrus (DG) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) were subsequently examined. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and 5-hydroxytryptamine involvement were evaluated using: (1) corticosterone measurements at 2 h and 4 h after MDMA treatment, (2) Lewis strain rats with blunted HPA-response and (3) pharmacological receptor-blockade. MDMA treatment was effective in attenuating stress behavioral responses only when paired with memory reactivation by a trauma-cue. The effects of the treatment on behavior were associated with a commensurate normalization of the dendritic cytoarchitecture of DG and BLA neurons. Pretreatment with RU486, Ketanserin, or Pindolol prevented the above improvement in anxiety-like behavioral responses. MDMA treatment paired with memory reactivation reduced the prevalence rate of PTSD-phenotype 14 days later and normalized the cytoarchitecture changes induced by PSS (in dendritic complexities) compared to saline control. MDMA treatment paired with a trauma-cue may modify or update the original traumatic memory trace through reconsolidation processes. These anxiolytic-like effects seem to involve the HPA axis and 5-HT systems.",0,"[0.9927805066108704, 0.007219518534839153]",0
4097,"Psilocybin use is associated with lowered odds of crime arrests in US adults: A replication and extension.^
Background: The United States boasts the largest prison population in the world, conferring significant direct and indirect costs (e.g. lost wages for the incarcerated, increased morbidity/mortality, etc.) to society. Recidivism rates are high for the imprisoned and most interventions to reduce criminality are minimally effective. Thus, in addition to the need for criminal justice reform, there is a need to better understand factors linked to lowered criminal behavior. Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the relationships between the use of classic psychedelic substances (psilocybin, LSD, peyote, and mescaline) and past year arrests for various crimes (i.e. property, violence, alcohol and substance use, miscellaneous crimes). Methods: This study used nationally representative data from The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) (2015–2019) (N = 211,549) to test the aforementioned associations. Results: Lifetime psilocybin use was associated with lowered odds of seven of 11 past year arrest variables (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) range = 0.30–0.73). Peyote was associated with reduced odds of motor vehicle theft (aOR = 0.30) and driving under the influence (aOR = 0.52), and mescaline was associated with reduced odds of drug possession/sale (aOR = 0.51). Virtually all other substances either shared no relationship to our outcomes or conferred higher odds of arrest. Conclusion: This study suggests that use of classic psychedelic substances is associated with lowered odds of crime arrests. Future research should explore whether causal factors and/or third variable factors (e.g. personality, political orientation) underlie the relationship between classic psychedelic use and reduced criminal behavior.",1,"[0.0036569940857589245, 0.9963429570198059]",1
7035,"A Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)-Guided Dashboard to Review Psilocybin Target Domains: A Systematic Review.^
BACKGROUND: Preliminary results from randomized controlled studies as well as identified molecular, cellular, and circuit targets of select psychedelics (e.g., psilocybin) suggest that their effects are transdiagnostic. In this review, we exploit the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) transdiagnostic framework, to synthesize extant literature on psilocybin. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify RDoC-based effects of psilocybin and vistas for future mechanistic and interventional research. METHODS: A systematic search in electronic databases (i.e., PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Web of Science) performed in January and February 2021 identified English articles published between 1990 and 2020 reporting the effects of psilocybin on mental health measures. Data from included articles were retrieved and organized according to the RDoC bio-behavioral matrix and its constituent six main domains, namely: positive valence systems, negative valence systems, cognitive systems, social processes, sensorimotor systems, and arousal and regulatory systems. RESULTS: The preponderance of research with psilocybin has differentially reported beneficial effects on positive valence systems, negative valence system, and social process domains. The data from the included studies support both short-term (23 assessments) and long-term (15 assessments) beneficial effects of psilocybin on the positive valence systems. While 12 of the extracted outcome measures suggest that psilocybin use is associated with increases in the ""fear"" construct of the negative valence systems domain, 19 findings show no significant effects on this construct, and seven parameters show lowered levels of the ""sustained threat"" construct in the long term. Thirty-four outcome measures revealed short-term alterations in the social systems' construct namely, ""perception and understanding of self,"" and ""social communications"" as well as enhancements in ""perception and understanding of others"" and ""affiliation and attachment"". The majority of findings related to the cognitive systems' domain reported dyscognitive effects. There have been relatively few studies reporting outcomes of psilocybin on the remaining RDoC domains. Moreover, seven of the included studies suggest the transdiagnostic effects of psilocybin. The dashboard characterization of RDoC outcomes with psilocybin suggests beneficial effects in the measures of reward, threat, and arousal, as well as general social systems. CONCLUSIONS: Psilocybin possesses a multi-domain effectiveness. The field would benefit from highly rigorous proof-of-mechanism research to assess the effects of psilocybin using the RDoC framework. The combined effect of psilocybin with psychosocial interventions with RDoC-based outcomes is a priority therapeutic vista.",1,"[0.0028005249332636595, 0.997199535369873]",1
5062,"Sex-dependent psychoneuroendocrine effects of THC and MDMA in an animal model of adolescent drug consumption.^
Ecstasy is a drug that is usually consumed by young people at the weekends and frequently, in combination with cannabis. In the present study we have investigated the long-term effects of administering increasing doses of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol [THC; 2.5, 5, 10 mg/kg; i.p.] from postnatal day (pnd) 28 to 45, alone and/or in conjunction with 3,4- methylenedioxymethamphetamine [MDMA; two daily doses of 10 mg/kg every 5 days; s.c.] from pnd 30 to 45, in both male and female Wistar rats. When tested one day after the end of the pharmacological treatment (pnd 46), MDMA administration induced a reduction in directed exploration in the holeboard test and an increase in open-arm exploration in an elevated plus maze. In the long-term, cognitive functions in the novel object test were seen to be disrupted by THC administration to female but not male rats. In the prepulse inhibition test, MDMA-treated animals showed a decrease in prepulse inhibition at the most intense prepulse studied (80 dB), whereas in combination with THC it induced a similar decrease at 75 dB. THC decreased hippocampal Arc expression in both sexes, while in the frontal cortex this reduction was only evident in females. MDMA induced a reduction in ERK1/2 immunoreactivity in the frontal cortex of male but not female animals, and THC decreased prepro-orexin mRNA levels in the hypothalamus of males, although this effect was prevented when the animals also received MDMA. The results presented indicate that adolescent exposure to THC and/or MDMA induces long-term, sex-dependent psychophysiological alterations and they reveal functional interactions between the two drugs. © 2013 Llorente-Berzal et al.",0,"[0.9945546388626099, 0.0054454077035188675]",0
6779,"Cannabis-induced psychotic disorders.^
Cannabis, and more specifically THC, has been proven, through clinical observation and laboratory confirmation, to cause psychiatric symptoms as a result of intoxication and withdrawal. These transient effects include positive and negative psychotic symptoms. In clinical settings, the official nosological system identifies this entity as cannabis-induced psychotic disorder. Epidemiologic studies found an incidence for this disorder of about 2.7 per 100,000 person years. Rate of conversion to schizophrenia-spectrum disorders ranges between 44.5% and 46% in 5–8 years of follow-up. Diagnostic tools to identify cannabis-induced psychotic disorder have limited reliability, especially if used outside of research settings with highly trained interviewers. Since the literature on this topic is so conflicting with regard to nosology, this chapter will focus on Cannabis-Induced Psychotic Disorder, as described in the DSM-5, which can be described as an acute, transient, self limited psychotic reaction during cannabis intoxication or withdrawal in the absence of a primary psychotic disorder. Laboratory evidence for this disorder has been collected through the past decade. D'Souza et al. designed an experiment to characterize the dose-related psychotomimetic effects of THC, in healthy individuals under double-blind, placebo-controlled laboratory conditions, using standardized behavioral and cognitive assessments. The group found that intravenous injection of THC produced transient effects including positive symptoms (suspiciousness, paranoid and grandiose delusions, conceptual disorganization, and illusions); negative symptoms (blunted affect, reduced rapport, lack of spontaneity, psychomotor retardation, and emotional withdrawal); perceptual alterations; euphoria; anxiety; and deficits in working memory, recall, and attention, without altering general orientation. Similar effects have been replicated in several studies from different research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)",0,"[0.9894463419914246, 0.01055371668189764]",0

Objective: To assess if HIV-infected patients on long-term successful combination antiretroviral therapy show cerebral blood flow (CBF) alterations in comparison with HIV-uninfected, otherwise similar controls. To explore whether such alterations are associated with HIV-associated cognitive impairment and to explore potential determinants of CBF alterations in HIV. Design: Cross-sectional comparison of CBF in an observational cohort study. Methods: Clinical, cognitive and MRI data of 100 middle-aged aviremic HIV-infected men on combination antiretroviral therapy and 69 HIV-uninfected controls were collected and compared. From pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling MRI data, CBF-maps were calculated. The associations of mean gray matter CBF with clinical and cognitive parameters were explored in regression models, followed by a spatial delineation in a voxel-based analysis. Results: CBF was decreased in HIV-infected patients compared with HIV-uninfected controls (P=0.02), adjusted for age, ecstasy use and waist circumference. Spatially distinct and independent effects of total gray matter volume and HIV-serostatus on CBF were found. Within the HIV-infected group, decreased CBF was associated with increased triglyceride levels (P=0.005) and prior clinical AIDS (P=0.03). No association between CBF and cognitive impairment was found. Conclusion: Decreased CBF was observed among HIV-infected patients, which was associated with both vascular risk factors as well as with measures of past immune deficiency.

3153,"Therapeutic uses of MDMA.^
There have been several scientifically controlled studies of the psychological and physiological effects of MDMA (methylenedioxymethamphetamine) in humans, and books and media reports have told many stories about the use of MDMA in healing. However, no scientifically controlled studies of MDMA in treatment have ever been published or completed. The first such study is underway at present and is described by Michael Mithoefer, MD, in these volumes. At the time of this writing in mid-2006, other therapeutic projects in the United States, Israel, Spain, and Switzerland are beginning. Other than small studies using ketamine for depression (Herman et al. 2000) and studies by Evgeny Krupitsky, MD (chapter in this publication) for addiction as described in these volumes, as of this writing in mid-2006, no controlled studies on the therapeutic use of any psychedelic drug have been published since the early 1970s (Mangini 1998). MDMA has been used therapeutically since the late 1970s, and there have been two systematic follow-up studies. However, these studies employed only customized questionnaires administered before and after the MDMA sessions. All of this work was done in the context of purely clinical psychiatric practice, and there were no control groups or sessions, or standardized or quantitative assessments. The first study (Greer and Tolbert 1986) reported on the first 29 people administered with MDMA from 1980 to 1983, before it became a controlled substance in the United States in 1985. The second report by Swiss psychiatrist Peter Gasser (Gasser 1995) describes the results of courses of treatment involving both MDMA and LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) in the same patients conducted by a small, organized group of Swiss psychiatrists from 1988 until 1993, when all psychedelic therapy was halted by the Swiss government. This chapter will summarize and comment on the findings of these two studies. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)",0,"[0.982943058013916, 0.01705697737634182]",0
5524,"Simultaneous EEG/fMRI recorded during ketamine infusion in patients with major depressive disorder.^
A single subanaesthetic dose of ketamine rapidly alleviates the symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD). However, few studies have investigated the acute effects of ketamine on the BOLD pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI) response and EEG spectra. In a randomised, double-blind, active placebo-controlled crossover trial, resting-state simultaneous EEG/fMRI was collected during infusion of ketamine or active placebo (remifentanil) in 30 participants with MDD. Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale scores showed a significant antidepressant effect of ketamine compared to placebo (69% response rate). phMRI analyses showed BOLD signal increases in the anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortices and sensitivity of the decrease in subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) BOLD signal to noise correction. EEG spectral analysis showed increased theta, high beta, low and high gamma power, and decreased delta, alpha, and low beta power with differing time-courses. Low beta and high gamma power time courses explained significant variance in the BOLD signal. Interestingly, the variance explained by high gamma power was significantly associated with non-response to ketamine, but significant associations were not found for other neurophysiological markers when noise correction was implemented. The results suggest that the decrease in sgACC BOLD signal is potentially noise and unrelated to ketamine's antidepressant effect, highlighting the importance of noise correction and multiple temporal regressors for phMRI analyses. The lack of effects significantly associated with antidepressant response suggests the phMRI methodology employed was unable to detect such effects, the effect sizes are relatively small, or that other processes, e.g. neural plasticity, underlie ketamine's antidepressant effect.",1,"[0.0026936426293104887, 0.9973063468933105]",1
7352,"Habenula Connectivity and Intravenous Ketamine in Treatment-Resistant Depression.^
BACKGROUND: Ketamine's potent and rapid antidepressant properties have shown great promise to treat severe forms of major depressive disorder (MDD). A recently hypothesized antidepressant mechanism of action of ketamine is the inhibition of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-dependent bursting activity of the habenula (Hb), a small brain structure that modulates reward and affective states. METHODS: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was conducted in 35 patients with MDD at baseline and 24 hours following treatment with i.v. ketamine. A seed-to-voxel functional connectivity (FC) analysis was performed with the Hb as a seed-of-interest. Pre-post changes in FC and the associations between changes in FC of the Hb and depressive symptom severity were examined. RESULTS: A reduction in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale scores from baseline to 24 hours after ketamine infusion was associated with increased FC between the right Hb and a cluster in the right frontal pole (t = 4.65, P = .03, false discovery rate [FDR]-corrected). A reduction in Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report score following ketamine was associated with increased FC between the right Hb and clusters in the right occipital pole (t = 5.18, P < .0001, FDR-corrected), right temporal pole (t = 4.97, P < .0001, FDR-corrected), right parahippocampal gyrus (t = 5.80, P = .001, FDR-corrected), and left lateral occipital cortex (t = 4.73, P = .03, FDR-corrected). Given the small size of the Hb, it is possible that peri-habenular regions contributed to the results. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results suggest that the Hb might be involved in ketamine's antidepressant action in patients with MDD, although these findings are limited by the lack of a control group.",1,"[0.0023635670077055693, 0.9976364374160767]",1
2780,"Drug and alcohol-impaired driving among electronic music dance event attendees.^
Background: Drug-impaired driving has received increased attention resulting from development of rapid drug-screening procedures used by police and state laws establishing per se limits for drug levels in drivers. Venues that host electronic music dance events (EMDEs) provide a unique opportunity to assess drug-impaired driving among a high proportion of young adult drug users. EMDEs are late-night dance parties marked by a substantial number of young adult attendees and elevated drug involvement. No studies to date have examined drug-impaired driving in a natural environment with active drug and alcohol users. Methods: Six EMDEs were sampled in San Diego, California, and Baltimore, Maryland. A random sample of approximately 40 attendees per event were administered surveys about alcohol and other drug (AOD) use and driving status, given breath tests for alcohol, and asked to provide oral fluid samples to test for illicit drug use upon entering and exiting the events. Results: Driving status reduced the level of alcohol use (including abstaining) but the impact on drug-taking was not significant. However, 62% of individuals who reported their intention to drive away from the events were positive for drugs or alcohol upon leaving. This suggests that these events and settings are appropriate ones for developing interventions for reducing risks for young adults. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

3734,"Blue-yellow colour vision impairment and cognitive deficits in occasional and dependent stimulant users.^
Specific blue-yellow colour vision impairment has been reported in dependent cocaine users and it was postulated that drug-induced changes in retinal dopamine neurotransmission are responsible. However, it is unclear whether these changes are confined to chronic cocaine users, whether they are specific for dopaminergic stimulants such as cocaine and amphetamine and whether they are related to cognitive functions such as working memory, encoding and consolidation. In 47 occasional and 29 dependent cocaine users, 23 MDMA (commonly known as 'ecstasy') users and 47 stimulant-naive controls, colour vision discrimination was measured with the Lanthony Desaturated Panel D-15 Test and memory performance with the Auditory Verbal Learning Test. Both occasional and dependent cocaine users showed higher colour confusion indices than controls. Users of the serotonergic stimulant MDMA (26%), occasional (30%) and dependent cocaine users (34%) exhibited more frequent blue-yellow colour vision disorders compared to controls (9%). Inferior performance of MDMA users was caused by a subgroup with high amphetamine co-use (55%), while MDMA use alone was not associated with decreased blue-yellow discrimination (0%). Cognitive performance was worse in cocaine users with colour vision disorder compared to users and controls with intact colour vision and both colour vision impairment and cognitive deficits were related to cocaine use. Occasional cocaine and amphetamine use might induce blue-yellow colour vision impairment, whereas the serotonergic stimulant MDMA does not impair colour vision. The association between colour vision impairment and cognitive deficits in cocaine users may reflect that retinal and cerebral dopamine alterations are linked to a certain degree. © 2012 CINP.",1,"[0.004293181002140045, 0.9957068562507629]",0
9401,"Polysubstance use and its correlates in adolescent ecstasy users in Taiwan.^
The aim of this study was to examine whether individual, family and peer factors can increase the risk of polysubstance use in Taiwanese adolescent ecstasy users. Two hundred adolescents with ecstasy use were recruited into this study. Their experience of using any other harmful substance in the preceding year and a variety of individual, family and peer characteristics were collected. The correlates of polysubstance use were examined using the two-step procedure of variable selection. The results indicated that 59 (29.5%) of the adolescent ecstasy users were polysubstance users. Ketamine, alcohol and areca quid were the three most prevalent substances used. Users who experienced dropping out of school, had poor mental health status and whose fathers had a low education level had an increased risk of polysubstance use. Clinicians should thoroughly screen adolescent ecstasy users who have the above factors as they are more likely to use other substances concomitantly. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

5968,"Effect of esketamine nasal spray on depressive symptoms in adults with severe major depressive disorder: a post hoc analysis of the aspire i and aspire ii studies.^
Background: ASPIRE I and ASPIRE II were 2 identically designed, global, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled phase 3 studies (NCT03039192, NCT03097133) designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of esketamine (ESK) nasal spray vs placebo (PBO) nasal spray, given in the context of comprehensive standard of care (SoC; ie, hospitalization, initiation, or optimization of antidepressant therapy), in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) who had active suicidal ideation with intent. These studies were the basis for the recent approval of ESK for the treatment of depressive symptoms in adults with MDD with acute suicidal ideation or behavior. To further understand the rapid effect of ESK +SoC vs PBO+SoC on depressive symptoms in patients with severe depression at baseline, we conducted a post hoc analysis of pooled data from ASPIRE I and ASPIRE II to examine changes in Montgomery‐Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total scores and Clinical Global Impression‐Severity of Suicidality‐Revised (CGI‐SS‐r) scores after ESK treatment. Methods: The ASPIRE I and II trials enrolled adults aged 18‐64 years with MDD confirmed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview and a minimum total MADRS score of >28 at baseline. Patients were randomized 1:1 to ESK 84 mg or PBO nasal spray twice weekly plus comprehensive SoC antidepressant treatment for 4 weeks. For this post hoc analysis, a subset of trial patients was identified as having severe depression per baseline total MADRS score >34 (Snaith Br J Psychiatry 1986). Change in MADRS total score was calculated from baseline to 4 hours post‐first dose, 24 hours post‐first dose, and predose on day 25 (ie, last day of double‐blind treatment phase). Differences between least squares mean (LSM) changes from baseline between groups in MADRS total score were examined using a mixed model for repeated measures. Percentages of subjects achieving response (ie, change in MADRS total score ≥50%) and remission (ie, MADRS total score ≤12) were also assessed using Cochran‐Mantel‐Haenszel tests. Generalized estimation equations were used to determine the relative odds of achieving a clinically meaningful improvement on the CGI‐SS‐r (≥1‐point decrease) scale with ESK+SoC vs PBO+SoC. A multiplicity adjustment procedure was not carried out. Results: Of 450 patients enrolled in the trials, 370 (82.2%) had severe MDD at baseline, as defined by MADRS score, and were included in this post hoc analysis (n=189, ESK+SoC; n=181, PBO +SoC). Demographic and psychiatric characteristics were similar between ESK+SoC and PBO+SoC groups at baseline (mean age: 40.3; 61.4% female). Mean (SD) MADRS total scores were 41.9 (4.62) and 42.5 (4.64), respectively. The ESK+SoC group had significantly greater decreases from baseline in MADRS total score vs the PBO+SoC group at 4 hours post‐first dose (‐12.6 vs ‐8.6; LSM difference [95% CI] ‐4.0 [‐5.9, ‐2.1]; P<0.001), at 24 hourspost‐first dose (‐16.4 vs ‐11.7; LSM difference [95% CI] ‐4.7 [‐6.9, ‐2.5]; P<0.001), and on day 25 (‐26.0 vs ‐22.8; LSM difference [95% CI] ‐3.2 [‐5.8, ‐0.7]; P=0.013). Significantly more patients in the ESK+SoC group vs PBO+SoC group attained response at 4 hours post‐first dose (24.5% vs 11.1%; P<0.001), at 24 hours post‐first dose (34.8% vs 22.4%; P=0.009), and on day 25 (76.7% vs 58.3%; P<0.001). The percentages of patients who attained remission were also greater in the ESK+SoC group vs PBO+SoC group at 4 hours post‐first dose (8.5% vs 2.8%; P=0.017), at 24 hours post‐first dose (18.2% vs 6.7%; P<0.001), and on day 25 (51.3% vs 36.1%; P=0.008). Patients in the ESK+SoC group were 78% more likely to experience a ≥1‐point decrease in CGI‐SS‐r score at 4 hours post‐first dose (odds ratio [95% CI] 1.78 [1.15, 2.74]; P=0.009) and 99% more likely at 24 hours post‐first dose (odds ratio [95% CI] 199 [1.24, 3.20]; P=0.005] than patients in the PBO+SoC group. Conclusions: Similar to findings from the ASPIRE global phase 3 clinical trial program to assess e ficacy of ESK+SoC vs PBO+SoC in reducing depressive symptoms in adults with moderate to severe MDD and suicidal ideation with intent, patients with severe MDD, as defined by MADRS total score >34, demonstrated significant improvement in depressive symptoms when treated with ESK +SoC compared with PBO+SoC as early as 4 hours after the first ESK dose. Improvements in depressive symptoms continued in favor of ESK+SoC treatment through study end of the doubleblind treatment phase. Additional analyses will be conducted to assess efficacy outcomes in patients with severe MDD defined through other validated instruments. ESK+SoC may provide an effective treatment of depressive symptoms with continued significant benefit for this population with challenging‐to‐treat depression. Reference: Snaith RP et al.

3978,"Inhibition of mirtazapine metabolism by Ecstasy (MDMA) in isolated perfused rat liver model.^
Background: Nowadays MDMA (3,4-methylendioxymethamphetamine), known as ecstasy, is widely abused among the youth because of euphoria induction in acute exposure. However, abusers are predisposed to depression in chronic consumption of this illicit compound. Mirtazapine (MRZ), an antidepressant agent, may be prescribed in MDMA-induced depression. MRZ is extensively metabolized in liver by CYP450 isoenzymes. 8-hydroxymirtazapine (8-OH) is mainly produced by CYP2D6. N-desmethylmirtazapine (NDES) is generated by CYP3A4. MDMA is also metabolized by the mentioned isoenzymes and demonstrates mechanism-based inhibition (MBI) in association with CYP2D6. Several studies revealed that MDMA showed inhibitory effects on CYP3A4. In the present study, our aim was to evaluate the impact of MDMA on the metabolism of MRZ in liver. Therefore, isolated perfused rat liver model was applied as our model of choice in this assessment. Methods: The subjects of the study were categorized into two experimental groups. Rats in the control group received MRZ-containing Krebs-Henselit buffer (1 mu g/ml). Rats in the treatment group received aqueous solution of 1 mg/ml MDMA (3 mg/kg) intraperitoneally 1 hour before receiving MRZ. Perfusate samples were analyzed by HPLC. Results: Analyses of perfusate samples showed 80% increase in the parent drug concentrations and 50% decrease in the concentrations of both metabolites in our treatment group compared to the control group. In the treatment group compared to the control group, AUC((0-120)) of the parent drug demonstrated 50% increase and AUC(0-120) of 8-OH and NDES showed 70% and 60% decrease, respectively. Observed decrease in metabolic ratios were 83% and 79% for 8-OH and NDES in treatment group compared to control group, respectively. Hepatic clearance (CLh) and intrinsic clearance (Cl-int) showed 20% and 60% decrease in treatment group compared to control group. Conclusion: All findings prove the inhibitory effects of ecstasy on both CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 hepatic isoenzymes. In conclusion, this study is the first investigation of MRZ metabolism in presence of MDMA in isolated perfused rat liver model.",0,"[0.668793797492981, 0.33120617270469666]",0
872,"Acute pharmacological effects of methylone in comparison to MDMA in humans.^
Objective: Methylone (3,4‐methylenedioxymethcathinone) is a synthetic cathinone that became popular as a nonillegal substitute of ecstasy (MDMA) due to its similar profile of desirable effects. This pilot study aims to obtain preliminary data on the acute pharmacological effects of methylone in comparison to MDMA and placebo, and to define the selected doses for future investigations. Material and/or methods: A double‐blind, placebocontrolled, crossover and randomized (lower doses were allocated previous to the higher dose) clinical trial in recreational stimulant consumers was carried out. The study consists of four cohorts, including three participants in each cohort (N = 12); in the first three cohorts, oral doses of methylone (50‐200 mg) were administered in comparison to placebo and in the 4th cohort, 200 mg of methylone were compared to 100 mg of MDMA and placebo. Study variables included: vital signs, Maddox wing device, psychomotor performance (Simple Reaction Time), subjective effects (visual analogue scales (VAS), ARCI‐49 item short form, VESSPA) measured over 10 h. Samples of blood, urine, oral fluid and sweat were collected to determine methylone concentrations. Results: Methylone at doses from 100 to 200 mg produced dose‐related cardiovascular effects and induced stimulant and euphorigenic effects, as reflected in VAS “stimulated,” “high” and ARCI‐MBG scale. Methylone 200 mg produced higher cardiovascular effects than MDMA 100 mg, although their subjective effects related to stimulation and wellbeing were of similar intensity. Conclusions: Methylone administered at doses from 100 to 200 mg induced sympathomimetic and euphorigenic effects following a dose‐response relationship. The profile of pharmacological effects induced by 200 mg of methylone was comparable to that of 100 mg of MDMA.",1,"[0.0025958367623388767, 0.997404158115387]",1

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2016-36851-001[/rid].) Background: Psychedelics induce intense modifications in the sensorium, the sense of 'self,' and the experience of reality. Despite advances in our understanding of the molecular and cellular level mechanisms of these drugs, knowledge of their actions on global brain dynamics is still incomplete. Recent imaging studies have found changes in functional coupling between frontal and parietal brain structures, suggesting a modification in information flow between brain regions during acute effects. Methods: Here we assessed the psychedelic-induced changes in directionality of information flow during the acute effects of a psychedelic in humans. We measured modifications in connectivity of brain oscillations using transfer entropy, a nonlinear measure of directed functional connectivity based on information theory. Ten healthy male volunteers with prior experience with psychedelics participated in 2 experimental sessions. They received a placebo or a dose of ayahuasca, a psychedelic preparation containing the serotonergic 5-HT2A agonist N,N-dimethyltryptamine. Results: The analysis showed significant changes in the coupling of brain oscillations between anterior and posterior recording sites. Transfer entropy analysis showed that frontal sources decreased their influence over central, parietal, and occipital sites. Conversely, sources in posterior locations increased their influence over signals measured at anterior locations. Exploratory correlations found that anterior-to-posterior transfer entropy decreases were correlated with the intensity of subjective effects, while the imbalance between anterior-to-posterior and posterior-to-anterior transfer entropy correlated with the degree of incapacitation experienced. Conclusions: These results suggest that psychedelics induce a temporary disruption of neural hierarchies by reducing top-down control and increasing bottom-up information transfer in the human brain.

2320,"Beating pain with psychedelics: Matter over mind?.^
Basic pain research has shed light on key cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying nociceptive and phenomenological aspects of pain. Despite these advances, we still yearn for the discovery of novel therapeutic strategies to address the unmet needs of about 70 % of chronic neuropathic pain patients whose pain fails to respond to opioids as well as to other conventional analgesic agents. Importantly, a substantial body of clinical observations over the past decade cumulatively suggests that the psychedelic class of drugs may possess heuristic value for understanding and treating chronic pain conditions. The present review presents a theoretical framework for hitherto insufficiently understood neuroscience-based mechanisms of psychedelics' potential analgesic effects. To that end, searches of PubMed-indexed journals were performed using the following Medical Subject Headings' terms: pain, analgesia, inflammatory, brain connectivity, ketamine, psilocybin, functional imaging, and dendrites. Recursive sets of scientific and clinical evidence extracted from this literature review were summarized within the following key areas: (1) studies employing psychedelics for alleviation of physical and emotional pain; (2) potential neuro-restorative effects of psychedelics to remediate the impaired connectivity underlying the dissociation between pain-related conscious states/cognitions and the subcortical activity/function leading to the eventual chronicity through immediate and long-term effects on dentritic plasticity; (3) antineuroinflammatory and pro-immunomodulatory actions of psychedelics as the may pertain to the role of these factors in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain; (4) safety, legal, and ethical consideration inherent in psychedelics' pharmacotherapy. In addition to direct beneficial effects in terms of reduction of pain and suffering, psychedelics' inclusion in the analgesic armamentarium will contribute to deeper and more sophisticated insights not only into pain syndromes but also into frequently comorbid psychiatric condition associated with emotional pain, e.g., depressive and anxiety disorders. Further inquiry is clearly warranted into the above areas that have potential to evolve into further elucidate the mechanisms of chronic pain and affective disorders, and lead to the development of innovative, safe, and more efficacious neurobiologically-based therapeutic approaches.",0,"[0.9905039668083191, 0.00949596893042326]",0

3821,"A single infusion of ketamine improves depression scores in patients with anxious bipolar depression.^
OBJECTIVE: Patents with anxious bipolar disorder have worse clinical outcomes and are harder to treat with traditional medication regimens compared to those with non-anxious bipolar disorder. Ketamine has been shown to rapidly and robustly decrease symptoms of depression in depressed patients with bipolar disorder. We sought to determine whether baseline anxiety status reduced ketamine's ability to decrease symptoms of depression. METHODS: Thirty-six patients with anxious (n = 21) and non-anxious (n = 15) treatment-resistant bipolar depression (types I and II; concurrently treated with either lithium or valproate) received a single infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) over 40 min. Post-hoc analyses compared changes in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) in anxious versus non-anxious depressed patients with bipolar disorder through 14 days post-infusion. Anxious bipolar depression was defined as DSM-IV bipolar depression plus a HDRS Anxiety/Somatization Factor score of ≥ 7. RESULTS: A linear mixed model revealed a significant effect of anxiety group on the MADRS (p = 0.04) and HDRS (p = 0.04). Significant drug effects (all p < 0.001) suggested that both anxious and non-anxious groups had an antidepressant response to ketamine. The drug-by-anxiety interactions were not significant (all p > 0.28). CONCLUSIONS: Both anxious and non-anxious patients with bipolar depression had significant antidepressant responses to ketamine, although the anxious depressed group did not show a clear antidepressant response disadvantage over the non-anxious group. Given that anxiety has been shown to be a predictor of poor treatment response in bipolar depression when traditional treatments are used, our findings suggest a need for further investigations into ketamine's novel role in the treatment of anxious bipolar depression.",1,"[0.0023868551943451166, 0.9976131916046143]",1

The treatment of depressive episodes remains complicated by the long latency of antidepressant efficacy, insufficient response, and high risk of suicide. Ketamine and esketamine have been proposed as fast-acting substances able to overcome these impediments.Since the first randomized controlled trial in the year 2000, numerous studies have explored the antidepressant efficacy of ketamine and esketamine. Clear evidence has emerged that a single infusion exerts a significant antidepressant and antisuicidal effect in both unipolar and bipolar depression. A few studies suggest that antidepressant response can be improved and maintained by repeated administration. Although intravenous application has been most common, subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intranasal application has also been successful. There is some evidence that ketamine may accelerate the response to electroconvulsive therapy without improving the overall response rate.The precise position of ketamine and esketamine within treatment algorithms have yet to be defined, and issues surrounding potential toxicity need to be resolved.",0,"[0.9906730055809021, 0.009326950646936893]",0

To this end, we surveyed a community sample of individuals (n = 159) who endorsed lifetime psychedelic use to examine relationships among psychedelic use and self-reported spirituality, difficulties in emotion regulation, and symptoms of mental health issues. Results revealed a pathway through which classic psychedelic use predicted greater spirituality, which in turn predicted better emotion regulation, ultimately predicting lower levels of anxiety, depressed mood, and disordered eating. These results contribute to our understanding of potential mechanisms of change with respect to psychedelics and mental health.

8087,"A single-infusion of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine improves fatigue scores in patients with bipolar disorder compared to placebo.^
Background: Fatigue is a highly prevalent residual symptom of depression that is difficult to treat with current monoaminergic antidepressants. Research has shown that ketamine, an N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that manipulates the glutamate system, produces rapid, robust, and moderately sustained improvements in depressive symptoms. However, there is a dearth of literature examining the effects of ketamine on fatigue specifically. We hypothesized that ketamine would rapidly improve fatigue symptoms in treatment‐resistant bipolar depressed patients. Methods: In a double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled, crossover study, 36 participants with treatment‐resistant bipolar depression (maintained on therapeutic levels of lithium or valproate) received a single intravenous infusion of ketamine hydrochloride at a dose of 0.5mg/kg over 40 minutes or placebo on 2 experimental days separated by 2 weeks. A post‐hoc analysis compared fatigue scores on ketamine vs. placebo from 40 minutes through 14 days using a novel scale (based on questions from validated rating scales). Results: A linear mixed model showed that patients had significantly lower fatigue scores following ketamine compared to placebo from 40 minutes (p=.002) through day 3 (p<.001). The drug difference was not significant at day 7 (p=.10), but it was at day 10 (p=.03) and 14 (p=.004). The largest difference was at day 2 (p<.001; d=.58). Conclusions: Ketamine rapidly and significantly improved fatigue symptoms relative to placebo in a group of treatment‐resistant bipolar depressed patients. Unlike current monoaminergic antidepressants that fail to alleviate fatigue in depression, the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine may provide swift and robust improvements to fatigue in depressed patients.",1,"[0.0025074149016290903, 0.9974925518035889]",1

8176,"Influence of subanesthetic dose of ketamine on theta cordance in unipolar depression.^
Background. A series of clinical studies demonstrated that QEEG prefrontal theta cordance value decreases after 1 week of treatment in responders to antidepressants and precedes clinical improvement.1. Ketamine, a non‐competitive antagonist of NMDA receptors, has a unique rapid antidepressant effect2 but its influence on theta cordance is still unknown. To date predictive value of cordance3 in response to single infusion of ketamine in depressive subjects has not been studied. We hypothesized in our study that the changes in prefrontal cordance 24 hours after the infusion will predict sustained antidepressant response fourth day after the infusion. Methods. In a double‐blind, cross‐over, randomized, placebo‐controlled experiment we studied the influence of ketamine (0.54 mg/kg) on theta cordance in a group of 27 right‐handed hospitalized depressive patients on stable antidepressant medication. Antidepressant response was defined as 50% decrease of depressive symptoms evaluated fourth and seventh day after infusion by means of Montgomery‐A˚sberg Depressive Rating Scale (MADRS). Psychotomimetic symptoms were evaluated by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale before and after the infusion.4 Three EEG segments obtained before, after the infusion and 24 hours after the dosing were entered into spectral analyses. QEEG cordance values in theta frequency band were calculated according to UCLA algorithm3 from 3 prefrontal electrodes (Fz, Fp1, Fp2). Results. Responders (n = 11) to ketamine in comparison to nonresponders (n = 16), showed significant difference in cordance values at the end of ketamine infusion (Spearman, P = .039). The cordance decrease, measured between the end of infusion and next day, positively correlated with ketamine antidepressant response (MADRS decrease) fourth day after infusion (2‐tailed Fisher's exact test, df = 1, P = .0076) with NPV 90.9% (95% CI 64.3% to 99.5%) and PPV 62.5% (95% CI 44.2% to 68.4%). Conclusions. Our data indicate that ketamine (glutamatergic‐based drug) infusion immediately induces similar changes as monoaminergic‐based antidepressants do gradually after a series of downstream signalling steps. The reduction in theta prefrontal cordance could serve as a marker of ketamine's sustained antidepressant response, a hypothesis that should be tested in larger depressive population.",1,"[0.002376094926148653, 0.997623860836029]",1

8932,"Three Naturally-Occurring Psychedelics and Their Significance in the Treatment of Mental Health Disorders.^
Classical psychedelics represent a family of psychoactive substances with structural similarities to serotonin and affinity for serotonin receptors. A growing number of studies have found that psychedelics can be effective in treating various psychiatric conditions, including post-traumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder, anxiety, and substance use disorders. Mental health disorders are extremely prevalent in the general population constituting a major problem for the public health. There are a wide variety of interventions for mental health disorders, including pharmacological therapies and psychotherapies, however, treatment resistance still remains a particular challenge in this field, and relapse rates are also quite high. In recent years, psychedelics have become one of the promising new tools for the treatment of mental health disorders. In this review, we will discuss the three classic serotonergic naturally occurring psychedelics, psilocybin, ibogaine, and N, N-dimethyltryptamine, focusing on their pharmacological properties and clinical potential. The purpose of this article is to provide a focused review of the most relevant research into the therapeutic potential of these substances and their possible integration as alternative or adjuvant options to existing pharmacological and psychological therapies.",0,"[0.9920101165771484, 0.007989884354174137]",0
9101,"Gender differences in clinical characteristics of emergency department patients involving illicit drugs use with analytical confirmation.^
Background: To compare gender differences in socio-demographics, clinical manifestations, and laboratory test results of individuals who visited emergency departments (EDs) involving drug use. Methods: We retrospectively collected the data from 10 hospitals in Taiwan on drug-related ED visits from May 2017 to December 2020. We then examined the gender differences in their socio-demographics, clinical manifestations, urine toxicological results, and other laboratory tests results using chi-square or multivariable logistic regression. Results: Among individuals with drug-related ED visits, there were 546 (73.7%) men and 195 (26.3%) women. The most commonly used drugs were meth/amphetamine, followed by synthetic cathinones, and ketamine and its analogs. Compared to men, women were younger (32.03 ± 10.86 vs. 36.51 ± 10.84 years, p < 0.001) and more likely to use new psychoactive substances (NPS) (p = 0.011). Men were more likely to have human immunodeficiency virus infection (p < 0.001), whereas women were more likely to report psychiatric comorbidities (p = 0.003). Women were less likely to have aggressive behaviors (odds ratio (OR): 0.59, 95% CI: 0.39–0.88). After adjusting for socio-demographics and drug types, women were still less likely to have aggressive behaviors than men (adjusted OR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.38–0.93). The likelihood of rhabdomyolysis and intensive care unit admission was higher in men (p < 0.001). Conclusion: We found considerable gender differences in clinical characteristics among ED-visiting drug users, which could offer valuable information for the future development of more tailored gender-specific drug prevention and treatment strategies.",0,"[0.9791874885559082, 0.02081252634525299]",1
3681,"An investigation into the sub-acute effects of ecstasy on aggressive interpretative bias and aggressive mood - are there gender differences?.^
The lowering of serotonin for a period following MDMA use could account for the increases in both self-rated and objective measures of aggression previously found in ecstasy users several days after taking the drug. There is some evidence of gender differences in the acute, sub-acute and long-term effects of MDMA use, and given that gender differences have been found in aggression, it is possible that men may experience more aggression mid-week than women. The aim of this study was to attempt to replicate findings showing increased bias towards aggressive material in ecstasy users several days after using the drug. In addition, to investigate possible gender differences in mid-week aggression. A total of 46 participants were tested: 19 ecstasy users and 27 controls were compared on the night of drug use and 4 days later. On day 4, a task designed to tap cognitive bias toward material with aggressive content was administered. Participants were required to process sentences that could be interpreted as either aggressive or neutral and subsequently remember them in a recognition test. This data set was then combined with the data from Curran et al.'s (2004) study that employed exactly the same procedure. Thus, the data from 107 participants was analysed to investigate gender differences. Ecstasy users recognized more aggressive sentences than controls and tended to react slower to neutral sentences than controls. Ecstasy users also rated themselves as being more aggressive and depressed than controls on day 4. No gender differences were found on any measure of aggression in the combined data set. Both male and female ecstasy users show a bias toward interpretation of ambiguous material in an aggressive manner when compared to controls 4 days after ecstasy use.",1,"[0.0028673536144196987, 0.9971326589584351]",1
2273,"Some aspects of drug use among students in Benin City, Nigeria.^
A review of the literature on drug abuse in Nigera shows the following: (1) abuse of drugs such as morphine, heroin, LSD and cocaine do not pose a serious problem; (2) the majority of the studies are carried out in one region and therefore cannot be generalized; (3) sampling procedures leave much to be desired. The present study, taking into consideration the above factors, was carried out to examine the pattern of drug use among school children in Benin City and where possible make comparisons with findings from other parts of the country. A questionnaire, which sought to gather information on personal and family background, drug knowledge, usage and academic achievements, among other variables, was administered to 350 boys and girls randomly selected from three of 13 secondary schools in Benin City. 323 (92%) of the 350 questionnaires were amenable to analysis, the age range of respondents between 11-21 years. 181 (56%) of them were males. All respondents reported knowledge of alcohol, with 215 (66.6%) taking it. None of the respondents reported having seen or used heroin, cocaine or LSD. Out of the 283 respondents that had heard of cannabis, only 71 (22%) reported having seen or handled it, while only males admitted using it. A smaller number of respondents (110) reported having knowledge of stimulants; 38 respondents claimed seeing or handling some form of stimulants and 12 males admitted using stimulants. A knowledge of sedatives and hypnotics was reported by 141 (43.4%) with more females having used them.

892,"Rejection and acceptance of LSD: Users and controls compared.^
In reviewing the natural history of LSD use, one is impressed with the rapid expansion of the size of the group which has taken the drug. Many individuals seem to be ready to have that sort of drug experience and, afterward, some become enthusiastic proselytizers. But their efforts to persuade others to take the drug do not always succeed; there are many individuals who are unwilling to try LSD. One is immediately curious. In what ways do those who resist taking LSD differ from those who are willing to take it? It is possible that these differences, if they can be isolated as variables, might be found to play an important role in impeding or facilitating the diffusion of other mind-altering drugs, alcohol or marijuana, for example. In the meantime, if one can set forth the variables which influence the acceptance or rejection of LSD, one has added to the understanding of the natural history of its use. We expected that resistance to LSD, defined as the refusal to take the drag when it was offered or a failure to pursue an opportunity to take the drug in circumstances where it was available, would depend upon four general sets of factors: the kind of information the person had about LSD effects in relationship to the kind of life experiences he was interested in having; the relationship of the potential receiver of LSD to the one offering it, including the evaluation of the latter by the former in terms of dominance, obligation, trustworthiness, and admiration; the life circumstances of the potential receiver in terms of general life satisfaction and distress; and the personality of the potential receiver, with special reference to ego control, flexibility, feelings of trust, and invulnerability. Interviews, observations, questionnaires, and participant interaction are productive research tools but do not provide a rigid experimental test of hypotheses. However, the hypotheses advanced have been of a rather general nature, and we think the method of inquiry fits the questions. The data do support a finding of consistent differences between persons who accept and reject LSD. Furthermore, drag-accepting behavior does appear to vary in the predicted direction with the kind of information a person possesses, with his or her relationship to the potential initiator in terms of power and status, with the personality of the person with reference to anxiety, ego control, and trust-distrust, and with the life circumstances of the person. More than these, a variety of other differences emerged which should be of considerable interest. Before reporting the findings, it is well to spend a moment on the control group employed. Its selection involved the same problems found in trying to obtain an LSD-using sample. We looked where we could to find people who had had the chance to take LSD and who had refused it. The best source of information was from LSD users themselves; they spoke of those who had rejected the drag. We inquired among persons already interviewed and among our acquaintances for leads to control subjects. In the end, we obtained a sample of forty-seven controls. We cannot contend that they are representative of all controls; we have no way of knowing how many people have had LSD offered to them, nor have we any way of knowing the characteristics of that population.

912,"Psilocybin-assisted treatment for alcohol dependence: a proof-of-concept study.^
Several lines of evidence suggest that classic (5HT2A agonist) hallucinogens have clinically relevant effects in alcohol and drug addiction. Although recent studies have investigated the effects of psilocybin in various populations, there have been no studies on the efficacy of psilocybin for alcohol dependence. We conducted a single-group proof-of-concept study to quantify acute effects of psilocybin in alcohol-dependent participants and to provide preliminary outcome and safety data. Ten volunteers with DSM-IV alcohol dependence received orally administered psilocybin in one or two supervised sessions in addition to Motivational Enhancement Therapy and therapy sessions devoted to preparation for and debriefing from the psilocybin sessions. Participants' responses to psilocybin were qualitatively similar to those described in other populations. Abstinence did not increase significantly in the first 4 weeks of treatment (when participants had not yet received psilocybin), but increased significantly following psilocybin administration (p < 0.05). Gains were largely maintained at follow-up to 36 weeks. The intensity of effects in the first psilocybin session (at week 4) strongly predicted change in drinking during weeks 5-8 (r = 0.76 to r = 0.89) and also predicted decreases in craving and increases in abstinence self-efficacy during week 5. There were no significant treatment-related adverse events. These preliminary findings provide a strong rationale for controlled trials with larger samples to investigate efficacy and mechanisms.

1618,"A Prospective, Multi-center Randomized, Controlled, Blinded Trial of Vagus Verve Stimulation for Difficult to Treat Depression: the RECOVER Trial.^
Introduction: Therapeutic Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) has been FDA‐approved for treatment‐resistant depression (TRD). In 2007, the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a non‐coverage decision, making access difficult for patients. In 2019, CMS requested a “coverage with evidence development trial” to determine potential VNS efficacy in the US Medicare TRD population. This trial, RECOVER, is co‐sponsored by CMS and the device maker (LivaNova) to assess VNS efficacy over 12 months is large, multi‐centered (N=71, US sites), randomized, and placebo‐controlled. Methods: Inclusion criteria include: ≥18 years old, diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or Major Depressive Episode (MDE) in bipolar disorder, chronic (2 years) or recurrent (≥ 4 MDEs), failure of four medical record‐verified AD treatments in the current MDE, a score of ≥ 22 on the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Exclusion criteria include: substance use and psychotic disorders, acute suicidal ideation/intention, severe personality disorder. All subjects undergo VNS implantation then randomized to active treatment (device on) or sham (implanted, not activated) for 12 months. Depression ratings are performed by blinded, offsite raters. The trial’s primary measure is number of months in response (active –vs‐ placebo). Results: 480 patients enrolled; subject mean age is 54.0, 34.6 mean MADRS, mean age of onset is 20.9, and 20.4 years of lifetime MDE. Average failed lifetime ADs is 14.1, with many receiving aggressive treatments: ECT (41.9%), TMS (46.7%), and ketamine (21.3%). Many report psychiatric hospitalizations (64.0%); attempted suicide (43.8%). To date, 222 patients (including 40 early terminated) have completed the trial’s first year. Conclusions: RECOVER is the largest prospective, randomized, device‐based, placebo‐controlled MDD trial ever undertaken; enrolling severe TRD patients not studied in most MDD clinical trials. It will provide a thorough understanding of the nature of VNS response (e.g., onset of response and potential baseline outcome predictors).

5972,"Reliability of three versus five saliva sampling times for assessing the cortisol awakening response.^
The cortisol awakening response (CAR) describes the sharp increase in cortisol secretion within 60 min after awakening. A summary of the CAR, the area under the cortisol curve above the awakening cortisol value (AUCi) is a widely used biomarker in health research. Estimation of the AUCi rely on a number of collected salivary samples at fixed time intervals (i.e., 5 samples in 15 min intervals) starting from awakening. Little empirical work has been executed to investigate the impact of reducing sampling times on AUCi estimation, which could potentially improve participant compliance and reduce operational costs. This study aimed to assess the reli-ability and validity of using 3-sample AUCi versus 5-sample AUCi, i.e., systematic and random fluctuations based on a large dataset from healthy and case individuals (total n = 537). We showed that the ideal timing of 3 -sam-pling times was 0-30-60 min with a median difference in AUCi of -8 nmol*h/L and interquartile range of 65 nmol*h/L among healthy individuals, and -12 nmol*h/L and 78 nmol*h/L among case individuals. We sub-sequently validated the 3-sample AUCi by re-analyzing three published association studies. Overall, we obtained similar p-values with 3-sample AUCi when compared to 5-sample AUCi, while smaller effect sizes and standard errors were observed. In conclusion, despite a less precise estimation of the AUCi itself, our data support that the AUC measure of the CAR, based on three samples collected at 0-30-60 min from awakening, provides reliable results in association studies.",0,"[0.9914146065711975, 0.008585420437157154]",0

Creativity is an essential cognitive ability linked to all areas of our everyday functioning. Thus, finding a way to enhance it is of broad interest. A large number of anecdotal reports suggest that the consumption of psychedelic drugs can enhance creative thinking; however, scientific evidence is lacking. Following a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group design, we demonstrated that psilocybin (0.17 mg/kg) induced a time- and construct-related differentiation of effects on creative thinking. Acutely, psilocybin increased ratings of (spontaneous) creative insights, while decreasing (deliberate) task-based creativity. Seven days after psilocybin, number of novel ideas increased. Furthermore, we utilized an ultrahigh field multimodal brain imaging approach, and found that acute and persisting effects were predicted by within- and between-network connectivity of the default mode network. Findings add some support to historical claims that psychedelics can influence aspects of the creative process, potentially indicating them as a tool to investigate creativity and subsequent underlying neural mechanisms.

Other articles were included because of their relevance to the topic. The studies that most reflect the positive effects are anecdotal reports, but there is difficulty in replicating these results in controlled studies.

7089,"The Potential Role of Serotonergic Hallucinogens in Depression Treatment.^
Due to an increasing number of depression diagnoses and limited effective treatments, researchers continue to explore novel therapeutic strategies for this disorder. Recently, interest has revolved around the use of serotonergic psychedelics to reduce the symptoms of depression. In this systematic review, we summarize the currently available knowledge on the safety and efficacy of psychedelic substances for the treatment of depression. A literature search of the PubMed/MEDLINE database identified 14 clinical trials from the last 10 years that examined the use of psilocybin, MDMA, DMT, or LSD for the treatment of depression symptoms. Some psychedelics, especially psilocybin, demonstrated an ability to reduce depressive symptoms as measured by several psychological scales, which was often sustained for months after the last psychedelic session. Moreover, one study revealed that psilocybin has comparable efficacy to escitalopram in the treatment of depression. None of the studies reported any serious adverse events associated with psychedelic administration. The reviewed studies suggest that psychedelics have great potential in depression therapy and, after addressing and overcoming the current study limitations, may be used as a novel method of treating depression in the future.",1,"[0.06069541722536087, 0.9393045902252197]",1
8746,"Antisuicidal Response Following Ketamine Infusion Is Associated With Decreased Nighttime Wakefulness in Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar Disorder.^
OBJECTIVE: Insomnia and disrupted sleep are associated with increased risk of suicide. The N-methyl-d-aspartate antagonist ketamine has been associated with reduced suicidal thoughts, but the mechanism of action is unknown. This study sought to evaluate differences in nocturnal wakefulness in depressed individuals who did and did not have an antisuicidal response to ketamine. METHODS: Thirty-four participants with baseline suicidal ideation diagnosed with either DSM-IV major depressive disorder (n = 23) or bipolar depression (n = 11) between 2006 and 2013 completed nighttime electroencephalography (EEG) the night before and the night after a single ketamine infusion (0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes). Suicidal ideation was assessed at baseline and the morning after ketamine infusion via several measures, including the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale suicide item, the suicide item of the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and the first 5 items of the Scale for Suicide Ideation. A generalized linear mixed model evaluated differences in nocturnal wakefulness, as verified by EEG, between those who had an antisuicidal response to ketamine and those who did not, controlling for baseline nocturnal wakefulness. Results were also compared to the sleep of healthy controls (n = 22). RESULTS: After analyses adjusted for baseline sleep, participants with an antisuicidal response to ketamine showed significantly reduced nocturnal wakefulness the night after ketamine infusion compared to those without an antisuicidal response (F₁,₂₂ = 5.04, P = .04). Level of nocturnal wakefulness after antisuicidal response to ketamine did not differ significantly from nocturnal wakefulness in the control sample but did differ at a trend level (F₁,₄₀ = 3.15, P = .08). CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in wakefulness following ketamine may point to a biological mechanism underlying the effect of ketamine on suicidal ideation.

Objective: We describe use and effects of head shop powders among opiate dependant polydrug users and recreational drug users. These powders contain cathinones and were sold as bath salts or plant food via the internet or in head shops. Method: As this is a relatively new phenomenon, a qualitative approach using three data sources, in-depth interviews, a focus group (containing 10 opiate users) and a head shop website containing 49 product reviews, was employed. Themes were identified. Results: According to the study population, these powders mimic the effects of cocaine, ecstasy and amphetamines. These substances were snorted, ingested or injected by people and were not used as bath salts or plant food. The users' experience indicates that these powders have the potential for dependence, and exhibit side effects such as insomnia, anxiety and other mental health effects. The users report that the effects of the substances vary over time indicating that the chemical contents of the powders may change. Conclusion: Though users' descriptions of effects varied, there were indications of health and dependency effects which were more severe and more common among problematic opiate users, who also experienced increased social vulnerability.

AIMS: To better understand the prevalence, correlates, risk factors and context of club drug use among US adults in the City of Chicago. DESIGN: An Audio Computer-Assisted Self Interview was administered to a household probability sample of adults, aged 18-40 years, from June 2001 to January 2002. SETTING: Subjects were drawn from randomly selected households using a multi-stage area probability design. PARTICIPANTS: The data represent 627 randomly selected adult participants. MEASUREMENT: Weighted prevalence estimates with design-effect adjusted confidence intervals of life-time, past 12 month and past 30 day use of any club drug and of specific club drugs; prevalence of rave attendance, other drug use, motivation for use among club drug users; chi2 tests of significance, logistic regression and adjusted odds ratios. FINDINGS: Overall club drug prevalence rates were nearly twice those obtained for MDMA alone. Club drug users were more likely to use multiple illicit substances and to report having been in treatment for substance use. A majority of life-time club drug users never attended a rave although rave attendees were more likely to report frequent use of MDMA. Use was associated with gender, race and sexual orientation. CONCLUSIONS: Prevention research should be informed by further population-based research on club drug use.

7664,"Behavioral Changes Over Time Following Ayahuasca Exposure in Zebrafish.^
The combined infusion of Banisteriopsis caapi stem and Psychotria viridis leaves, known as ayahuasca, has been used for centuries by indigenous tribes. The infusion is rich in N, N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, with properties similar to those of serotonin. Despite substantial progress in the development of new drugs to treat anxiety and depression, current treatments have several limitations. Alternative drugs, such as ayahuasca, may shed light on these disorders. Here, we present time-course behavioral changes induced by ayahuasca in zebrafish, as first step toward establishing an ideal concentration for pre-clinical evaluations. We exposed adult zebrafish to five concentrations of the ayahuasca infusion: 0 (control), 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 3 ml/L (n = 14 each group), and behavior was recorded for 60 min. We evaluated swimming speed, distance traveled, freezing and bottom dwelling every min for 60 min. Swimming speed and distance traveled decreased with an increase in ayahuasca concentration while freezing increased with 1 and 3 ml/L. Bottom dwelling increased with 1 and 3 ml/L, but declined with 0.1 ml/L. Our data suggest that small amounts of ayahuasca do not affect locomotion and reduce anxiety-like behavior in zebrafish, while increased doses of the drug lead to crescent anxiogenic effects. We conclude that the temporal analysis of zebrafish behavior is a sensitive method for the study of ayahuasca-induced functional changes in the vertebrate brain.",0,"[0.9893937110900879, 0.010606266558170319]",0
8913,"5-HT modulation of dopamine release in basal ganglia in psilocybin-induced psychosis in man--a PET study with [11C]raclopride.^
The modulating effects of serotonin on dopamine neurotransmission are not well understood, particularly in acute psychotic states. Positron emission tomography was used to examine the effect of psilocybin on the in vivo binding of [11C]raclopride to D2-dopamine receptors in the striatum in healthy volunteers after placebo and a psychotomimetic dose of psilocybin (n = 7). Psilocybin is a potent indoleamine hallucinogen and a mixed 5-HT2A and 5-HT1A receptor agonist. Psilocybin administration (0.25 mg/kg p.o.) produced changes in mood, disturbances in thinking, illusions, elementary and complex visual hallucinations and impaired ego-functioning. Psilocybin significantly decreased [11C]raclopride receptor binding potential (BP) bilaterally in the caudate nucleus (19%) and putamen (20%) consistent with an increase in endogenous dopamine. Changes in [11C]raclopride BP in the ventral striatum correlated with depersonalization associated with euphoria. Together with previous reports of 5-HT receptor involvement in striatal dopamine release, it is concluded that stimulation of both 5-HT2A and 5-HT1A receptors may be important for the modulation of striatal dopamine release in acute psychoses. The present results indirectly support the hypothesis of a serotonin-dopamine dysbalance in schizophrenia and suggest that psilocybin is a valuable tool in the analysis of serotonin-dopamine interactions in acute psychotic states.",1,"[0.003072523046284914, 0.9969274401664734]",1
8523,"Development and validation of an LC-MS/MS method for the quantification of mescaline and major metabolites in human plasma.^
Mescaline is a psychedelic phenethylamine found in different species of cacti. Currently, mescaline's acute subjective effects and pharmacokinetics are investigated in several modern clinical studies. Therefore, we developed a bioanalytical method for the rapid quantification of mescaline and its metabolites in human plasma. Mescaline and its metabolites 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenylacetic acid (TMPAA), N-acetyl mescaline (NAM), and 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxyphenethylamine (4-desmethyl mescaline) were simultaneously analyzed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Optimal chromatographic separation was achieved with an Acquity Premier HSS T3 C(18) column. The analytes were detected in positive ionization mode using scheduled multiple reaction monitoring. A single step extraction method was implemented to enable fast and automatable plasma sample preparation. An intra-assay accuracy between 84.9% and 106% and a precision of ≤ 7.33% was observed in three validation runs. Plasma was extracted by simple protein precipitation, resulting in a complete recovery (≥ 98.3%) and minor matrix effects (≤ 7.58%). No interference with endogenous matrix components could be detected in human plasma samples (n = 7). Importantly, method sensitivity sufficed for assessing pharmacokinetic parameters of mescaline in clinical study samples with lower limits of quantification of 12.5, 12.5, and 1.25 ng/mL for mescaline, TMPAA, and NAM, respectively. Nonetheless, 4-desmethyl mescaline could not be selectively quantified in pharmacokinetic samples due to interference with another mescaline metabolite. Overall, we developed and validated a reliable and very easy-to-use method for forensic applications as well as investigating the clinical pharmacokinetics of mescaline.",1,"[0.0056882877834141254, 0.9943116903305054]",1
7903,"Ketamine amplifies induced gamma frequency oscillations in the human cerebral cortex.^
At subanaesthetic doses, ketamine, an N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, has demonstrated remarkable and rapid antidepressant efficacy in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The mechanism of action of ketamine is complex and not fully understood, with altered glutamatergic function and alterations of high-frequency oscillatory power (Wood et al., 2012) noted in animal studies. Here we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) in a single blind, crossover study to assess the neuronal effects of 0.5 mg/kg intravenous ketamine on task-related high-frequency oscillatory activity in visual and motor cortices. Consistent with animal findings, ketamine increased beta amplitudes, decreased peak gamma frequency in visual cortex and significantly amplified gamma-band amplitudes in motor and visual cortices. The amplification of gamma-band activity has previously been linked in animal studies to cortical pyramidal cell disinhibition. This study provides direct translatable evidence of this hypothesis in humans, which may underlie the anti-depressant actions of ketamine.

679,"Association between early onset of cigarette, alcohol and cannabis use and later drug use patterns: An Analysis of a survey in European metropolises.^
Objectives: The study presents data about age of onset of alcohol, cigarette and cannabis use and investigates the association between age of onset and later drug use patterns. Methods: Using a sample from a cross-sectional multi-site study, personal interviews were conducted with 3,503 individuals aged 12-49 years. Last-month prevalence, age of onset and associations with subsequent use patterns were investigated. Results: Having started with cannabis before the age of 16 years was associated with an odds ratio of 1.6 for heavy cannabis use. For males, the odds ratio of heavy cannabis use was 1.7, when cannabis was already initiated by the age of 16. Heavy use of ecstasy, amphetamines, hallucinogens and cocaine is associated with use of cigarettes before 13 (OR = 1.9). For males, the odds ratio was 2.2 and for women 1.9. Conclusions: Early use of alcohol, according to this data, does not seem to be related to subsequent heavy drug use. Early onset cannabis users show increasing probabilities of heavy use patterns. Preventive intervention programs have to start earlier than school-based programs normally do and specific developmental pathways need to be addressed. Copyright © 2005 S.

218,"N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor in working memory impairments in schizophrenia: event-related potential study of late stage of working memory process.^
Working memory (WM) deficit in schizophrenic patients has been well established. Still, underlying biological substrate of the impairment is not clear. Among neurotransmitter hypotheses of schizophrenia, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor model is mostly supported, considering that NMDA receptor antagonist can elicit both psychosis and cognitive impairment observed in schizophrenic patients. In current study, to test the neuropsychological and the electrophysiological effects of NMDA receptor in WM, event-related potentials (ERPs) of Sternberg's short-term memory scanning task (SMST) were analyzed in 10 healthy subjects under intravenous administration of a subanesthetic dose of ketamine (0.65 mg/kg/h) or placebo (normal saline). Late positive component (LPC) of ERP was hypothesized to reflect later stage of WM. Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale score was significantly increased (t=-5.75, df=9, P<.001) and correct response rate was significantly decreased (t=2.21, df=9, P=.054) after ketamine administration. Neither reaction time nor LPC latency, which reflect memory scanning time, was changed. Amplitude of LPC was significantly reduced after ketamine administration (z=-2.31, number of observations=120, P=.021). In conclusion, NMDA receptor antagonist administration elicited WM deficit both in behavioral and electrophysiological level.

8870,"Oxytocin receptor gene variations and socio-emotional effects of MDMA: A pooled analysis of controlled studies in healthy subjects.^
Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) increases oxytocin, empathy, and prosociality. Oxytocin plays a critical role in emotion processing and social behavior and has been shown to mediate the prosocial effects of MDMA in animals. Genetic variants, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) may influence the emotional and social effects of MDMA in humans. The effects of common genetic variants of the OXTR (rs53576, rs1042778, and rs2254298 SNPs) on the emotional, empathogenic, and prosocial effects of MDMA were characterized in up to 132 healthy subjects in a pooled analysis of eight double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. In a subset of 53 subjects, MDMA produced significantly greater feelings of trust in rs1042778 TT genotypes compared with G allele carriers. The rs53576 and rs225498 SNPs did not moderate the subjective effects of MDMA in up to 132 subjects. None of the SNPs moderated MDMA-induced impairments in negative facial emotion recognition or enhancements in emotional empathy in the Multifaceted Empathy Test in 69 subjects. MDMA significantly increased plasma oxytocin concentrations. MDMA and oxytocin concentrations did not differ between OXTR gene variants. The present results provide preliminary evidence that OXTR gene variations may modulate aspects of the prosocial subjective effects of MDMA in humans. However, interpretation should be cautious due to the small sample size. Additionally, OXTR SNPs did not moderate the subjective overall effect of MDMA (any drug effect) or feelings of ""closeness to others"".

3182,"Psilocybin modulates functional connectivity of the amygdala during emotional face discrimination.^
Recent studies suggest that the antidepressant effects of the psychedelic 5-HT2A receptor agonist psilocybin are mediated through its modulatory properties on prefrontal and limbic brain regions including the amygdala. To further investigate the effects of psilocybin on emotion processing networks, we studied for the first-time psilocybin's acute effects on amygdala seed-to-voxel connectivity in an event-related face discrimination task in 18 healthy volunteers who received psilocybin and placebo in a double-blind balanced cross-over design. The amygdala has been implicated as a salience detector especially involved in the immediate response to emotional face content. We used beta-series amygdala seed-to-voxel connectivity during an emotional face discrimination task to elucidate the connectivity pattern of the amygdala over the entire brain. When we compared psilocybin to placebo, an increase in reaction time for all three categories of affective stimuli was found. Psilocybin decreased the connectivity between amygdala and the striatum during angry face discrimination. During happy face discrimination, the connectivity between the amygdala and the frontal pole was decreased. No effect was seen during discrimination of fearful faces. Thus, we show psilocybin's effect as a modulator of major connectivity hubs of the amygdala. Psilocybin decreases the connectivity between important nodes linked to emotion processing like the frontal pole or the striatum. Future studies are needed to clarify whether connectivity changes predict therapeutic effects in psychiatric patients.",1,"[0.002941757906228304, 0.9970582723617554]",1

OBJECTIVES: Life-threatening cancer or other diseases can induce anxiety and depressive symptoms. We performed a systematic review with meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials assessing patients with cancer or other life-threatening diseases using validated anxiety and depression scales. METHODS: PubMed was searched up to November 15, 2022 and citations were applied to prespecified inclusion criteria. Disease rating scales for anxiety or depression included the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) (STAI Trait [STAI-T], STAI-State [STAI-S]), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (HADS-Anxiety [HADS-A]; HADS-Depression [HADS-D]), Profile of Mood States (POMS), and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D or GRID-HAM-D-17). Safety outcomes included assessments of blood pressure and heart rate. RESULTS: Five trials, predominantly in cancer patients, had data assessing anxiety and depressive symptoms. These trials found promising results for psychedelics versus placebo in several anxiety and depression scales but increases in blood pressure and heart rate also occurred. There were some concerns of risk of bias because it is difficult to truly randomize a psychedelic trial and there was a high percentage of patients in the trials who had used psychedelics in the past. There was high heterogeneity for all analyses that we could not explain. CONCLUSIONS: Although the results are promising, future trials are needed to assess the optimal psychedelic, dose, number of sessions required, and how psychedelic naïve patients would respond both psychologically and hemodynamically before this therapy can be considered for widescale clinical use.",1,"[0.2669830322265625, 0.7330169677734375]",1

The Patient-Focused Drug Development initiative of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) aims to ensure that the patient experience of disease and treatment is an integral component of the drug development process. The 21st Century Cures Act and Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) VI require the FDA to publicly report the type of patient-experience data reviewed in a new drug application (NDA) to inform regulatory decision-making. This report describes a recent approach adopted at Janssen of integrating patient-experience data into the NDA for esketamine (SPRAVATO®) nasal spray with a newly initiated oral antidepressant (esketamine + AD) for treatment-resistant depression. During the development of esketamine + AD, patient-experience data were collected using several patient-reported outcomes, including the Sheehan Disability Scale and 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Additionally, a patient-preference study assessed the relative importance of benefits and harms that patients allocated to different attributes of treatment. Preferences were collected from patients enrolled in phase 3 esketamine trials and from an online panel of primarily ketamine-naive patients. Patient-experience data were integrated into the esketamine NDA, the FDA advisory committee meeting briefing document, and the Sponsor's presentation. The FDA acknowledged reviewing the patient-experience data and determined that they supported esketamine + AD for treatment-resistant depression. This report highlights the importance of integrating patient-experience methods early in drug development, their impact on assessing patient-relevant benefits and risks, and how they can help improve clinical program design.",0,"[0.9903167486190796, 0.009683234617114067]",0

8775,"Effects of verapamil on morphine-induced euphoria, analgesia and respiratory depression in humans.^
Organic calcium (Ca++) channel antagonists enhance opiate‐induced analgesia and antagonize respiratory depression produced by morphine in rodents. Our preliminary data indicated that verapamil reduces the subjective effects of morphine in humans. We therefore assessed morphine‐verapamil interactions in 12 experienced, male polydrug users with histories of heroin abuse by using a double‐blind, cross‐over study design. Treatments consisted of two drug infusions. Either verapamil, 2.5 or 10 mg, or saline was infused, 30 ml i.v. over 2 min; half way through this infusion either 10 mg of morphine or saline was infused, 3 ml i.v. over 10 sec, via a second catheter. Autonomic parameters, responsiveness to pain and subjective self‐reports of mood and feeling state were measured over 4 hr. Analgesia was measured using a finger pressure test and hand immersion in ice water. Respiration was measured by using respiratory inductive plethysmography and transcutaneous CO2 levels. The Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI) was used to measure the subjective effects. Morphine had a liminal effect on pain threshold, but verapamil potentiated this effect to elevate pain threshold significantly. Verapamil did not affect the ability of morphine to increase pain endurance or to produce respiratory depression. Morphine produced positive affective responses, as demonstrated by elevated scores on the Morphine‐Benzedrine Group subscale of the ARCI. Verapamil alone produced no effects on any ARCI subscales; however, 10 mg of verapamil significantly reduced morphine‐elevated MBG scores over a 3‐hr period. The results suggest the euphorigenic and analgesic effects of opioids may be differentiated by using Ca++ channel blockers. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B. V., Amsterdam.

1647,"Synaptic potentiation is critical for rapid antidepressant response to ketamine in treatment-resistant major depression.^
BACKGROUND: Clinical evidence that ketamine, a nonselective N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, has therapeutic effects within hours in people suffering from depression suggests that modulating glutamatergic neurotransmission is a fundamental step in alleviating the debilitating symptoms of mood disorders. Acutely, ketamine increases extracellular glutamate levels, neuronal excitability, and spontaneous γ oscillations, but it is unknown whether these effects are key to the mechanism of antidepressant action of ketamine. METHODS: Twenty drug-free major depressive disorder patients received a single, open-label intravenous infusion of ketamine hydrochloride (.5 mg/kg). Magnetoencephalographic recordings were made approximately 3 days before and approximately 6.5 hours after the infusion, whereas patients passively received tactile stimulation to the right and left index fingers and also while they rested (eyes-closed). Antidepressant response was assessed by percentage change in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale scores. RESULTS: Patients with robust improvements in depressive symptoms 230 min after infusion (responders) exhibited increased cortical excitability within this antidepressant response window. Specifically, we found that stimulus-evoked somatosensory cortical responses increase after infusion, relative to pretreatment responses in responders but not in treatment nonresponders. Spontaneous somatosensory cortical γ-band activity during rest did not change within the same timeframe after ketamine in either responders or nonresponders. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest NMDAR antagonism does not lead directly to increased cortical excitability hours later and thus might not be sufficient for therapeutic effects of ketamine to take hold. Rather, increased cortical excitability as depressive symptoms improve is consistent with the hypothesis that enhanced non-NMDAR-mediated glutamatergic neurotransmission via synaptic potentiation is central to the antidepressant effect of ketamine.",1,"[0.0024234773591160774, 0.9975765347480774]",1

6719,"Dance clubbing on MDMA and during abstinence from Ecstasy/MDMA: prospective neuroendocrine and psychobiological changes.^
BACKGROUND/AIMS: The present study is the first to prospectively compare a group of recreational Ecstasy users when dance clubbing on 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and when clubbing during abstinence from Ecstasy/MDMA. METHODS: Twelve normal healthy volunteers (mean age = 23.2 years) were assessed at a Saturday night dance club under self-administered MDMA. On the other weekend they went to the same dance club without taking MDMA (order counterbalanced). Both conditions involved 5 test sessions conducted at similar times: pre-drug baseline, 1 h post-drug clubbing, 2.5 h post-drug clubbing, and 2 and 4 days later. The assessments included body and ambient temperature, physical activity (pedometer), as well as self-ratings for mood state, physical activity, thermal comfort and thirst. Saliva samples were analyzed for MDMA, cortisol and testosterone. RESULTS: The cortisol levels increased significantly by 800% when dance clubbing on MDMA, while testosterone increased significantly by 75%; neither neuroendocrine measure was altered during abstinence. Saliva analyses confirmed the presence of MDMA when dancing on Ecstasy and its absence when dancing off Ecstasy. The pedometer values and self-rated levels of dancing were similar at both weekends. Hot and cold flushes and feeling hot increased significantly under MDMA. The mean body temperature did not change significantly, although there was a borderline trend for increased values after MDMA. Feelings of happiness and excitement increased under MDMA, although they were not significantly greater than when clubbing during abstinence. CONCLUSIONS: Neurohormonal release may be an important part of the acute MDMA experience. The large cortisol increase provides further data on the bioenergetic stress model of recreational Ecstasy/MDMA.",1,"[0.003631037659943104, 0.9963690042495728]",1
9114,"Basal functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and psychological distress in recreational ecstasy polydrug users.^
Abstract: Rationale: Ecstasy (MDMA) is a psychostimulant drug which is increasingly associated with psychobiological dysfunction. While some recent studies suggest acute changes in neuroendocrine function, less is known about long-term changes in HPA functionality in recreational users. Objectives: The current study is the first to explore the effects of ecstasy-polydrug use on psychological distress and basal functioning of the HPA axis through assessing the secretion of cortisol across the diurnal period. Method: Seventy-six participants (21 nonusers, 29 light ecstasy-polydrug users, 26 heavy ecstasy-polydrug users) completed a substance use inventory and measures of psychological distress at baseline, then two consecutive days of cortisol sampling (on awakening, 30 min post awakening, between 1400 and 1600 hours and pre bedtime). On day 2, participants also attended the laboratory to complete a 20-min multitasking stressor. Results: Both user groups exhibited significantly greater levels of anxiety and depression than nonusers. On day 1, all participants exhibited a typical cortisol profile, though light users had significantly elevated levels pre-bed. On day 2, heavy users demonstrated elevated levels upon awakening and all ecstasy-polydrug users demonstrated elevated pre-bed levels compared to non-users. Significant between group differences were also observed in afternoon cortisol levels and in overall cortisol secretion across the day. Conclusions: The increases in anxiety and depression are in line with previous observations in recreational ecstasy-polydrug users. Dysregulated diurnal cortisol may be indicative of inappropriate anticipation of forthcoming demands and hypersecretion may lead to the increased psychological and physical morbidity associated with heavy recreational use of ecstasy. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",1,"[0.0026860544458031654, 0.997313916683197]",1
9147,"LSD and language: Decreased structural connectivity, increased semantic similarity, changed vocabulary in healthy individuals.^
Language has been explored as a window into the mind. Psychedelics, known to affect perception and cognition, seem to change language, but a systematic, time-dependent exploration is lacking. Therefore, we aimed at mapping the psychedelic effects on language over the time course of the acute and sub-acute effects in an explorative manner. For this, 24 healthy volunteers (age [mean±SD, range]: 35±11, 25-61 years; 33% women) received 50 μg lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) or inactive placebo in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. We assessed different language productions (experience reporting, storytelling), components (structure, semantics, vocabulary) and time points (+0 h to +24 h). Language productions included 5-min experience reporting (+1.5 h, +6.5 h) and 1-min storytelling (+0 h, +2 h, +4 h, +6 h, +24 h). Language structure was assessed by computing speech topology (SpeechGraphs), semantics by semantic distances (FastText), vocabulary by word categories (LIWC). LSD, compared to placebo, changed language structure, including decreased verbosity, lexicon, global and local connectivity (+1.5 h to +4 h); decreased semantic distances between neighbouring words and overall words (+2 h to +24 h); and changed vocabulary related to grammar, persons, time, space and biological processes (+1.5 h to +24 h). In conclusion, low to moderate LSD doses changed language over diverse production types, components and time points. While simpler and disconnected structure and semantic similarity might reflect cognitive impairments, changed vocabulary might reflect subjective perceptions. Therefore, language under LSD might provide a window into the psychedelic mind and automated language quantifications should be better explored as valuable tools to yield more unconstrained insights into psychedelic perception and cognition.",1,"[0.003070495091378689, 0.9969294667243958]",1

BACKGROUND: This study sought to reproduce, in a larger sample, previous findings of a correlation between smaller raw 3-Tesla (3T) hippocampal volumes and improved antidepressant efficacy of ketamine in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD). A secondary analysis stratified subjects according to functional BDNF rs6265 (val66met) genotype. METHODS: Unmedicated subjects with treatment-resistant MDD ( n=55) underwent baseline structural 3T MRI. Data processing was conducted with FSL/FIRST and Freesurfer software. The amygdala, hippocampus, and thalamus were selected a priori for analysis. All subjects received a single 0.5mg/kg × 40-minute ketamine infusion. Pearson correlations were performed with subcortical volumes and percent change in MADRS score (from baseline to 230 minutes, 1 day, and 1 week post-infusion). RESULTS: Raw and corrected subcortical volumes did not correlate with antidepressant response at any timepoint. In val/val subjects ( n=23), corrected left and right thalamic volume positively correlated with antidepressant response to ketamine at 230 minutes post-infusion but did not reach statistical significance. In met carriers ( n=14), corrected left and right thalamic volume negatively correlated with antidepressant response to ketamine. CONCLUSION: Baseline subcortical volumes implicated in MDD did not correlate with ketamine's antidepressant efficacy.

Participants tended to be in their 20s, White-British, in education or employed; 64% were male. Participants reported a pattern of infrequent but intense consumption (47% used between 4-12 times/year, average consumption in one setting was 12 g, a high dose). Use was explained in terms of laughing, hallucinations, altering perspective (41-74%), and feelings of being closer to nature (49%). Negative experiences reported included paranoia (35%) and anxiety (32%). Mushroom use was located within a wider recreational drug and alcohol culture. Four focus groups aided the interpretation of the data. Future research is recommended into negative experiences. Implications for policy and harm minimisation literature are discussed.

Objective: Poly-substance use in gay social ('club') settings is common. Recent studies suggest a link between 'club' drug use and sexual risk behaviours.

Methods: Life history interviews were conducted with 12 HIV seroconverters and 12 age-matched controls recruited from a prospective cohort study of young gay and bisexual men in Vancouver, British Columbia. Textual data concerning illicit substance use and unsafe sex were analyzed using NUDIST software. Results: Most men related a substantial knowledge of and experience with crystal and ecstasy. Both drugs had attributes that enhanced gay socialization and were used in the same venues. Crystal was used to remain awake and increase energy. Ecstasy was used to induce euphoria and group connectedness. However, unlike ecstasy, crystal was associated with a distinct pattern of sexual arousal that frequently included unprotected (sometimes group) sex, was more likely to be used regularly by HIV-positive men, and was reportedly highly addictive and problematic.

D-Fenfluramine, a serotonin releaser, was administered to neonatal rats on postnatal days 11-20 (a stage of hippocampal development analogous to third trimester human ontogeny). As adults, the D-fenfluramine-treated offspring exhibited dose-related impairments of sequential and spatial learning and reference memory in the absence of sensorimotor impairments. Procedures to minimize stress and to control for other performance effects prior to testing for spatial learning demonstrated that nonspecific factors did not account for the selective effects of D-fenfluramine on learning and memory. Developmental D-fenfluramine-induced spatial and sequential learning deficits are similar to previous findings with developmental MDMA treatment. By contrast, recent findings with developmental D-methamphetamine treatment showed spatial learning deficits while sparing sequential learning. The spatial learning effects common to all three drugs suggest that they may share a common mechanism of action, however, the effects are not related to long-lasting changes in hippocampal 5-HT levels as no differences were found in adulthood. Whether the cognitive deficits are related to the effects of substituted amphetamines on corticosteroids, other aspects of the 5-HT system, or some unidentified neuronal substrates is not known, but the data demonstrate that these drugs are all capable of inducing long-term adverse effects on learning.",0,"[0.9919474720954895, 0.00805248599499464]",0
1744,"Ketamine alters functional gamma and theta resting-state connectivity in healthy humans: Implications for schizophrenia treatment targeting the glutamate system.^
Disturbed functional connectivity is assumed to cause neurocognitive deficits in patients suffering from schizophrenia. A Glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) dysfunction has been suggested as a possible mechanism underlying altered connectivity in schizophrenia, especially in the gamma- and theta-frequency range. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of the NMDAR-antagonist ketamine on resting-state power, functional connectivity, and schizophrenia-like psychopathological changes in healthy volunteers. In a placebo-controlled crossover design, 25 healthy subjects were recorded using resting-state 64-channel-electroencephalography (EEG) (eyes closed). The imaginary coherence-based Multivariate Interaction Measure (MIM) was used to measure gamma and theta connectivity across 80 cortical regions. The network-based statistic was applied to identify involved networks under ketamine. Psychopathology was assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the 5-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale (5D-ASC). Ketamine caused an increase in all PANSS (p < 0.001) as well as 5D-ASC scores (p < 0.01). Significant increases in resting-state gamma and theta power were observed under ketamine compared to placebo (p < 0.05). The source-space analysis revealed two distinct networks with an increased mean functional gamma- or theta-band connectivity during the ketamine session. The gamma-network consisted of midline regions, the cuneus, the precuneus, and the bilateral posterior cingulate cortices, while the theta-band network involved the Heschl gyrus, midline regions, the insula, and the middle cingulate cortex. The current source density (CSD) within the gamma-band correlated negatively with the PANSS negative symptom score, and the activity within the gamma-band network correlated negatively with the subjective changed meaning of percepts subscale of the 5D-ASC. These results are in line with resting-state patterns seen in people who have schizophrenia and argue for a crucial role of the glutamate system in mediating dysfunctional gamma- and theta-band-connectivity in schizophrenia. Resting-state networks could serve as biomarkers for the response to glutamatergic drugs or drug development efforts within the glutamate system.

1808,"A sub-set of psychoactive effects may be critical to the behavioral impact of ketamine on cocaine use disorder: Results from a randomized, controlled laboratory study.^
Efforts to translate sub-anesthetic ketamine infusions into widespread clinical use have centered around developing medications with comparable neurobiological activity, but with attenuated psychoactive effects so as to minimize the risk of behavioral toxicity and abuse liability. Converging lines of research, however, suggest that some of the psychoactive effects of sub-anesthetic ketamine may have therapeutic potential. Here, we assess whether a subset of these effects - the so-called mystical-type experience - mediates the effect of ketamine on craving and cocaine use in cocaine dependent research volunteers. We found that ketamine leads to significantly greater acute mystical-type effects (by Hood Mysticism Scale: HMS), dissociation (by Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale: CADSS), and near-death experience phenomena (by the Near-Death Experience Scale: NDES), relative to the active control midazolam. HMS score, but not the CADSS or NDES score, was found to mediate the effect of ketamine on global improvement (decreased cocaine use and craving) over the post-infusion period. This is the first controlled study to show that mystical-type phenomena, long considered to have therapeutic potential, may work to impact decision-making and behavior in a sustained manner. These data suggest that an important direction for medication development is the identification of ketamine-like pharmacotherapy that is selectively psychoactive (as opposed to free of experiential effects entirely), so that mystical-type perspectival shifts are more reliably produced and factors lending to abuse or behavioral impairment are minimized. Future research can further clarify the relationship between medication-occasioned mystical-type effects and clinical benefit for different disorders.

1482,"Brain volume in chronic ketamine users - relationship to sub-threshold psychotic symptoms and relevance to schizophrenia.^
RATIONALE: Ketamine may model aspects of schizophrenia arising through NMDA receptor activity deficits. Although acute ketamine can induce effects resembling both positive and negative psychotic symptoms, chronic use may be a closer model of idiopathic psychosis. OBJECTIVES: We tested the hypotheses that ketamine users had lower brain volumes, as measured using MRI, and greater sub-threshold psychotic symptoms relative to a poly-drug user control group. METHODS: Ketamine users (n = 17) and poly-drug using controls (n = 19) were included in the study. All underwent volumetric MRI imaging and measurement of sub-threshold psychotic symptoms using the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental State (CAARMS). Freesurfer was used to analyse differences in regional brain volume, cortical surface area and thickness between ketamine users and controls. The relationship between CAARMS ratings and brain volume was also investigated in ketamine users. RESULTS: Ketamine users were found to have significantly lower grey matter volumes of the nucleus accumbens, caudate nucleus, cerebellum and total cortex (FDR p < 0.05; Cohen's d = 0.36-0.75). Within the cortex, ketamine users had significantly lower grey matter volumes within the frontal, temporal and parietal cortices (Cohen's d 0.7-1.31; FDR p < 0.05). They also had significantly higher sub-threshold psychotic symptoms (p < 0.05). Frequency of ketamine use showed an inverse correlation with cerebellar volume (p < 0.001), but there was no relationship between regional brain volumes and sub-threshold psychotic symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic ketamine use may cause lower grey matter volumes as well as inducing sub-threshold psychotic symptoms, although these likely arise through distinct mechanisms.",1,"[0.0024529919028282166, 0.9975469708442688]",1
4421,"Neural Correlates of the DEEPP (Anti-suicidal Response to Ketamine in Treatment-Resistant Bipolar Depression) Study: Protocol for a Pilot, Open-Label Clinical Trial.^
BACKGROUND: Suicide is among the top 10 leading causes of death worldwide. Of people who died by suicide, the majority are diagnosed with depression. It is estimated that 25%-60% of people with bipolar depression (BD) will attempt suicide at least once, and 10%-15% will die by suicide. Several treatments, such as lithium, clozapine, electroconvulsive therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy, have been shown to be effective in treating suicidality. However, these treatments can be difficult to tolerate or may take months to take effect. Ketamine, a glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, has been shown to have rapid antisuicidal effect and antidepressant qualities, and is thus a promising intervention to target acute suicidality in patients with BD. However, the biological mechanism underlying its therapeutic action remains poorly understood. Enhancing our understanding of underlying mechanisms of action for ketamine's effectiveness in reducing suicidality is critical to establishing biological markers of treatment response and developing tailored, personalized interventions for patients with BD. OBJECTIVE: This is an open-label clinical trial to test the safety and feasibility of repeated ketamine infusions to treat acute suicidality. The primary objective is to test the safety and feasibility of ketamine intervention. The secondary objective is to examine ketamine's potential neurophysiological mechanisms of action by assessing cortical excitation and inhibition to determine potential biomarkers of clinical response. Other objectives are to evaluate the effect of ketamine on acute suicidality and other clinical outcomes, such as depressive symptoms and quality of life, to inform a future larger trial. METHODS: This open-label clinical trial aims to test the safety and feasibility of repeated ketamine infusions in patients with BD for suicidality and to assess ketamine's neurophysiological effects. A sterile form of racemic ketamine hydrochloride will be administered over a 40-minute intravenous infusion 2 times per week on nonconsecutive days for 4 weeks (8 sessions). We will recruit 30 adults (24-65 year olds) over 2 years from an academic psychiatric hospital in Toronto, Canada. RESULTS: This study is currently ongoing and actively recruiting participants. So far, 5 participants have completed the trial, 1 is currently in active treatment, and 8 participants are on the waitlist to be screened. We anticipate initial results being available in the fall of 2023. This proposal was presented as a poster presentation at the Research to Reality Global Summit on Psychedelic-Assisted Therapies and Medicine, held in May 2022 in Toronto, Canada. CONCLUSIONS: Developing effective interventions for acute suicidality in high-risk populations such as those with BD remains a major therapeutic challenge. Ketamine is a promising treatment due to its rapid antidepressant and antisuicidal effects, but its underlying neurophysiological mechanisms of action remain unknown.

3786,"Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of methylphenidate and MDMA administered alone or in combination.^
Methylphenidate and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy') are widely misused psychoactive drugs. Methylphenidate increases brain dopamine and norepinephrine levels by blocking the presynaptic reuptake transporters. MDMA releases serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine through the same transporters. Pharmacodynamic interactions of methylphenidate and MDMA are likely. This study compared the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic effects of methylphenidate and MDMA administered alone or in combination in healthy subjects using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Methylphenidate did not enhance the psychotropic effects of MDMA, although it produced psychostimulant effects on its own. The haemodynamic and adverse effects of co-administration of methylphenidate and MDMA were significantly higher compared with MDMA or methylphenidate alone. Methylphenidate did not change the pharmacokinetics of MDMA and vice versa. Methylphenidate and MDMA shared some subjective amphetamine-type effects; however, 125 mg of MDMA increased positive mood more than 60 mg of methylphenidate, and methylphenidate enhanced activity and concentration more than MDMA. Methylphenidate and MDMA differentially altered facial emotion recognition. Methylphenidate enhanced the recognition of sad and fearful faces, whereas MDMA reduced the recognition of negative emotions. Additionally, the present study found acute pharmacodynamic tolerance to MDMA but not methylphenidate. In conclusion, the combined use of methylphenidate and MDMA does not produce more psychoactive effects compared with either drug alone, but potentially enhances cardiovascular and adverse effects. The findings may be of clinical importance for assessing the risks of combined psychostimulant misuse.

5476,"Cannabis and nicotine co-use among primary care patients in a state with legal cannabis access.^
The aim of this exploratory analysis was to evaluate cannabis exposure, reasons for use and problematic cannabis use among adult primary care patients in Washington state (United States) who co-use cannabis and nicotine (tobacco cigarettes and/or nicotine vaping) compared to patients who endorse current cannabis use only. As part of a NIDA Clinical Trials Network (CTN) parent study, patients who completed a cannabis screen as part of routine primary care were randomly sampled (N = 5,000) to a receive a confidential cannabis survey. Patients were stratified and oversampled based on the frequency of past-year cannabis use and for Black, indigenous, or other persons of color. Patients who endorsed past 30-day cannabis use are included here (N = 1388). Outcomes included; prevalence of cannabis use, days of cannabis use per week and times used per day, methods of use, THC:CBD content, non-medical and/or medical use, health symptoms managed, and cannabis use disorder (CUD) symptom severity. We conducted unadjusted bivariate analyses comparing outcomes between patients with cannabis and current nicotine co-use to patients with cannabis-only use. Nicotine co-use (n = 352; 25.4 %) was associated with differences in method of cannabis use, THC:CBD content, days of use per week and times used per day, number of health symptoms managed, and CUD severity (all p < 0.001), compared to primary care patients with cannabis-only use (n = 1036). Interventions targeting cannabis and nicotine co-use in primary care are not well-established and further research is warranted given findings of more severe cannabis use patterns and the adverse health outcomes associated with co-use.",0,"[0.987206757068634, 0.012793210335075855]",0
6456,"An Update on the Efficacy and Tolerability of Oral Ketamine for Major Depression: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.^
BACKGROUND: Intravenous Ketamine has shown robust antidepressant efficacy although other routes of administration are currently needed. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of oral ketamine for depression. METHODS: A comprehensive search of major electronic databases from inception to April 2020 was performed. Studies of oral ketamine for depression, from case series to randomized clinical trials, were eligible. Randomized controlled trials were included in a meta-analysis, focusing on response, remission, time to effect, and side effects. RESULTS: A total of 917 articles were identified with 890 studies screened, yielding a total of 10 studies included in our systematic review.Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (N = 161, mean age 37.9 ± 9.5 years, 58.6% females) were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled analysis suggested a significant antidepressant effect of oral ketamine (SMD: -0.75; 95% CI: -1.08, -0.43; p<0.0001; I(2) = 0%) although remission rates (RR:2.77; 95% CI:0.96, 8.00; p = 0.06) and response rates (RR:2.58; 95% CI:0.94,7.08; p = 0.07) were marginal compared to placebo at the endpoint. Oral ketamine antidepressant effects seemed to take effect at the 2nd week (SMD: -0.71; 95% CI: -1.08, -0.35; p = 0.001; I(2) = 0%). There were no significant differences in the overall side-effects between oral ketamine and the placebo group (RR 1.28, 95% CI: 0.89-1.83; p = 0.19). CONCLUSION: This focused meta-analysis of oral ketamine suggests a marginal efficacy for major depressive disorder without increased risk of adverse events. Further larger sample studies are needed to confirm these preliminary findings, analyzing differential response/remission rates by affective disorder, optimal dosing strategies, and its long-term effects.",1,"[0.003031801898032427, 0.9969682097434998]",1
4327,"Clinical Trial Design Challenges and Opportunities for Emerging Treatments for Opioid Use Disorder: A Review.^
IMPORTANCE: Novel treatments for opioid use disorder (OUD) are needed to address both the ongoing opioid epidemic and long-standing barriers to existing OUD treatments that target the endogenous μ-opioid receptor (MOR) system. The goal of this review is to highlight unique clinical trial design considerations for the study of emerging treatments for OUD that address targets beyond the MOR system. In November 2019, the Analgesic, Anesthetic, and Addiction Clinical Trial Translations, Innovations, Opportunities, and Networks (ACTTION) public-private partnership with the US Food and Drug Administration sponsored a meeting to discuss the current evidence regarding potential treatments for OUD, including cannabinoids, psychedelics, sedative-hypnotics, and immunotherapeutics, such as vaccines. OBSERVATIONS: Consensus recommendations are presented regarding the most critical elements of trial design for the evaluation of novel OUD treatments, such as: (1) stage of treatment that will be targeted (eg, seeking treatment, early abstinence/detoxification, long-term recovery); (2) role of treatment (adjunctive with or independent of existing OUD treatments); (3) primary outcomes informed by patient preferences that assess opioid use (including changes in patterns of use), treatment retention, and/or global functioning and quality of life; and (4) adverse events, including the potential for opioid-related relapse or overdose, especially if the patient is not simultaneously taking maintenance MOR agonist or antagonist medications. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Applying the recommendations provided here as well as considering input from people with lived experience in the design phase will accelerate the development, translation, and uptake of effective and safe therapeutics for individuals struggling with OUD.",0,"[0.9899278283119202, 0.01007210835814476]",0
1312,"Preliminary evidence for lowered basal cortisol in a naturalistic sample of methamphetamine polydrug users.^
The effects of chronic methamphetamine use on neuroendocrine functioning in humans are largely undocumented. Here we assessed basal plasma oxytocin, arginine vasopressin, and cortisol levels in a naturalistic sample of methamphetamine polydrug users (n = 12) compared with controls matched for age, gender, education, occupation status, and marital status (n = 17). All of the methamphetamine users tested positive for blood methamphetamine and/or its main metabolite, amphetamine. Other drugs of abuse were detected in a small number of methamphetamine users (MDMA [3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine; n = 2], THC [delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol; n = 2]). Almost half of the methamphetamine users reported using methamphetamine intravenously, and others smoked or ingested the drug. Methamphetamine users had significantly lower basal plasma cortisol (p = .025), but similar basal plasma oxytocin and arginine vasopressin levels compared with controls. Basal plasma oxytocin was positively correlated (p = .011), with basal plasma arginine vasopressin in controls, but not in methamphetamine users. Methamphetamine users reported higher rates of psychiatric symptoms including substance use disorders, impulsivity, and positive, negative, manic, and disorientation symptoms compared with controls. Psychiatric symptoms were not related to neuroendocrine functioning in either group.

RATIONALE: Subanaesthetic ketamine infusion in healthy volunteers induces experiences redolent of early psychosis, including changes in the experience of one's own body. It is not clear, however, whether repeated self-administration of ketamine has a sustained effect on body representation that is comparable to that found during acute administration. OBJECTIVES: We sought to establish whether chronic ketamine use resulted in disturbances to sense of body ownership. METHODS: Following on from our work on the effects of acute ketamine infusion, we used the rubber hand illusion (RHI) to experimentally manipulate the sense of body ownership in chronic ketamine users, compared to healthy controls. RESULTS: Chronic ketamine users experienced the RHI more strongly and reported more body-image aberrations, even though they had not recently taken the drug. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the chronic ketamine model for psychosis models more long-lasting changes in sense of ownership, perhaps more akin to schizophrenia.",1,"[0.0024143459741026163, 0.997585654258728]",1
1143,"Combined psychotherapy and medication treatment.^
The literature supports several psychotherapeutic and pharmacological approaches as first- and second-line treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Meta-analytic reviews consistently demonstrate that trauma-focused psychotherapies outperform wait-list control and placebo-therapy conditions in randomized clinical trials, with greater reductions in PTSD symptom severity that is maintained after treatment ends. This chapter examines this literature and discusses research and clinical practice issues related to combined psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for the treatment of PTSD. The chapter is divided into two broad categories: (1) evidence for combining psychotherapy with empirically supported medications prescribed daily as monotherapies for PTSD, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and (2) evidence for combining psychotherapy with acute-acting medications and interventions prescribed to enhance specific psychotherapeutic processes, such as extinction learning and emotional engagement. Such psychotherapy-specific adjunctive interventions include d-cycloserine (DCS), methylene blue, yohimbine, propranolol, dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS).

5071,"Cognitive and subjective acute dose effects of intramuscular ketamine in healthy adults.^
Ketamine is a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist. Given the purported role of the NMDA receptor in long-term potentiation, the primary purpose of the present study was to further understand the dose-related effects of ketamine on memory. The study was also designed to provide information about the relative effects of ketamine on memory versus nonmemory effects and to more fully characterize ketamine's overall pattern and time course of effects. Single intramuscular injections of ketamine (0.2 mg/kg, 0.4 mg/kg) were administered to 18 healthy adult volunteers using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Word lists were used to evaluate episodic memory (free recall, recognition memory, source memory) and metamemory. Working memory, time estimation, psychomotor performance, and subjective effects were assessed repeatedly for 5 hours after drug administration. Ketamine selectively impaired encoding (as measured by free recall) while sparing retrieval, working memory while sparing attention, and digit symbol substitution task speed while sparing accuracy. Ketamine did not significantly impair recognition or source memory, metamemory, or time estimation. There were no hallucinations or increases in mystical experiences with ketamine. Memory measures were less sensitive to ketamine effects than subjective or psychomotor measures. Subjective effects lasted longer than memory and most psychomotor impairments. Ketamine produces selective, transient, dose- and time-related effects. In conjunction with previous studies of drugs with different mechanisms of actions, the observed selectivity of effects enhances the understanding of the pharmacological mechanisms underlying memory, attention, psychomotor performance, and subjective experience.",1,"[0.0025882155168801546, 0.9974117875099182]",1

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of a constant rate infusion of ketamine on cardiac index (CI) in sheep, as estimated using noninvasive cardiac output (NICO) monitoring by partial carbon dioxide rebreathing, when anesthetized with sevoflurane at the previously determined minimum alveolar concentration that blunts adrenergic responses (MAC(BAR)). ANIMALS 12 healthy Dorset-crossbred adult sheep. PROCEDURES Sheep were anesthetized 2 times in a balanced placebo-controlled crossover design. Anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane delivered via a tight-fitting face mask and maintained at MACBAR. Following induction, sheep received either ketamine (1.5 mg/kg IV, followed by a constant rate infusion of 1.5 mg/kg/h) or an equivalent volume of saline (0.9% NaCl) solution (placebo). After an 8-day washout period, each sheep received the alternate treatment. NICO measurements were performed in triplicate 20 minutes after treatment administration and were converted to CI. Blood samples were collected prior to the start of NICO measurements for analysis of ketamine plasma concentrations. The paired t test was used to compare CI values between groups and the ketamine plasma concentrations with those achieved during the previous study. RESULTS Mean +/- SD CI of the ketamine and placebo treatments were 2.69 +/- 0.65 and 2.57 +/- 0.53 L/min/m(2), respectively. No significant difference was found between the 2 treatments.

1766,"Effects of haloperidol on the behavioral, subjective, cognitive, motor, and neuroendocrine effects of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol in humans.^
INTRODUCTION: Cannabinoids produce a spectrum of effects in humans including euphoria, cognitive impairments, psychotomimetic effects, and perceptual alterations. The extent to which dopaminergic systems contribute to the effects of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta-9-THC) remains unclear. This study evaluated whether pretreatment with a dopamine receptor antagonist altered the effects of Delta-9-THC in humans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a 2-test-day double-blind study, 28 subjects including healthy subjects (n = 17) and frequent users of cannabis (n = 11) were administered active (0.057 mg/kg) or placebo oral haloperidol in random order followed 90 and 215 min later by fixed order intravenous administration of placebo (vehicle) and active (0.0286 mg/kg) Delta-9-THC, respectively. RESULTS: Consistent with previous reports, intravenous Delta-9-THC produced psychotomimetic effects, perceptual alterations, and subjective effects including ""high."" Delta-9-THC also impaired verbal recall and attention. Haloperidol pretreatment did not reduce any of the behavioral effects of Delta-9-THC. Haloperidol worsened the immediate free and delayed free and cued recall deficits produced by Delta-9-THC. Haloperidol and Delta-9-THC worsened distractibility and vigilance. Neither drug impaired performance on a motor screening task, the Stockings of Cambridge task, or the delayed match to sample task. Frequent users had lower baseline plasma prolactin levels and blunted Delta-9-THC induced memory impairments. CONCLUSIONS: The deleterious effects of haloperidol pretreatment on the cognitive effects of Delta-9-THC are consistent with the preclinical literature in suggesting crosstalk between DAergic and CBergic systems. However, it is unlikely that DA D(2) receptor mechanisms play a major role in mediating the psychotomimetic and perceptual altering effects of Delta-9-THC. Further investigation is warranted to understand the basis of the psychotomimetic effects of Delta-9-THC and to better understand the crosstalk between DAergic and CBergic systems.",0,"[0.9861317873001099, 0.013868198730051517]",0
5157,"Prevalence of illicit drug use among youth: Results from the Australian School Students' Alcohol and Drugs Survey.^
Objective: To estimate the prevalence of illicit drug use among Australian secondary school students. Method: Data was collected as part of the Australian School Student's Alcohol and Drugs Survey, a national survey of 29,447 secondary school students. Results: Of all students aged 12-17 years, 39.9% (44.1% of males and 35.9% of females) reported having used at least one illicit drug in their lifetime. Cannabis was the most widely used illicit drug with 36.4% of all students reporting having used cannabis. Substantially fewer students reported using other drugs: hallucinogens (8.6%), amphetamines (6.1%), cocaine (3.6%), ecstasy (3.6%), opiates (3.7%) and steroids (1.8%). There were clear gender and age differences in the prevalence of illicit drug use: more males than females reported illicit drug use and the lifetime prevalence of illicit drug use increased with age. Most of those who reported illicit drug use had used drugs on relatively few occasions although there was a small minority of the sample who reported more frequent use. Finally, there were strong association between regular cannabis use and the use of other illicit drugs in the past year, and moderate associations between illicit drug use and the extent of both tobacco and alcohol use. Conclusions: The findings of this, the first national survey of illicit drug use among Australian school students, indicate a high prevalence of illicit drug use. Comparisons with previous regionally based surveys suggest there may have been a recent increase in the prevalence of cannabis use and highlight the need for further monitoring of and prevention efforts aimed at reducing illicit drug use among students.",0,"[0.9848809242248535, 0.015119108371436596]",0
4100,"Perspectives on the therapeutic potential of MDMA: A nation-wide exploratory survey among substance users.^
Background: Alcohol and other substance use disorders are commonly associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and the presence of these comorbidities is associated with worse treatment outcomes. Additionally, disparities in substance and PTSD prevalence have been associated with minority races and ethnicities, and minorities have been shown to be less likely to engage in treatment. Psychedelic-assisted treatments, including 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), have shown preliminary trans-diagnostic effectiveness, however it is unknown how individuals with substance use disorders view the therapeutic potential of MDMA therapy. Previous studies have also shown that minority races and ethnicities are under-represented in the MDMA trials, leading to concerns about inequitable access to clinical treatment. Methods: To explore demographic characteristics related to patient-level perspectives on the therapeutic potential of MDMA-assisted therapy, this study describes data from a nationwide, cross-sectional survey of 918 individuals self-reporting criteria consistent with alcohol or substance use disorders. Results: Overall, a majority of individuals reported support for medical research of MDMA (68.1%), belief that MDMA-assisted therapy might be a useful treatment (70.1%), and willingness to try MDMA-assisted therapy if it were determined to be an appropriate treatment for them (58.8%). No race or ethnicity differences were found in support for further research or belief in effectiveness, however there were small disparities in terms of willingness to try MDMA-assisted therapy and concerns related to use of this treatment approach.

There is a substantive clinical literature on classical hallucinogens, most commonly lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) for the treatment of alcohol use disorder. However, there has been no published research on the effect of LSD on alcohol consumption in animals. This study evaluated the effect of LSD in mice using a two-bottle choice alcohol drinking paradigm. Adult male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to ethanol to develop preference and divided into three groups of equal ethanol consumption, and then treated with single intraperitoneal injection of saline or 25 or 50 μg/kg LSD and offered water and 20% ethanol. The respective LSD-treated groups were compared to the control group utilizing a multilevel model for repeated measures. In mice treated with 50 μg/kg LSD ethanol consumption was reduced relative to controls (p = 0.0035), as was ethanol preference (p = 0.0024), with a group mean reduction of ethanol consumption of 17.9% sustained over an interval of 46 days following LSD administration. No significant effects on ethanol consumption or preference were observed in mice treated with 25 μg/kg LSD. Neither total fluid intake nor locomotor activity in the LSD-treated groups differed significantly from controls. These results suggest that classical hallucinogens in the animal model merit further study as a potential approach to the identification of targets for drug discovery and investigation of the neurobiology of addiction.",0,"[0.9880262613296509, 0.01197371631860733]",0
6806,"Effects of a psychedelic 5-HT2A receptor agonist on anxiety-related behavior and fear processing in mice.^
Psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy gained considerable interest as a novel treatment strategy for fear-related mental disorders but the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. The serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptor is a key target underlying the effects of psychedelics on emotional arousal but its role in fear processing remains controversial. Using the psychedelic 5-HT2A/5-HT2C receptor agonist 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) and 5-HT2A receptor knockout (KO) mice we investigated the effect of 5-HT2A receptor activation on emotional processing. We show that DOI administration did not impair performance in a spontaneous alternation task but reduced anxiety-like avoidance behavior in the elevated plus maze and elevated zero maze tasks. Moreover, we found that DOI did not block memory recall but diminished fear expression in a passive avoidance task. Likewise, DOI administration reduced fear expression in an auditory fear conditioning paradigm, while it did not affect retention of fear extinction when administered prior to extinction learning. The effect of DOI on fear expression was abolished in 5-HT2A receptor KO mice. Administration of DOI induced a significant increase of c-Fos expression in specific amygdalar nuclei. Moreover, local infusion of the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist M100907 into the amygdala reversed the effect of systemic administration of DOI on fear expression while local administration of DOI into the amygdala was sufficient to suppress fear expression. Our data demonstrate that activation of 5-HT2A receptors in the amygdala suppresses fear expression but provide no evidence for an effect on retention of fear extinction. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.",0,"[0.9939285516738892, 0.006071459501981735]",0

OBJECTIVES: Rigorous clinical trials suggest ketamine is safe and well-tolerated in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). There is a paucity of data on the safety and tolerability of ketamine in community-based clinics treating patients with TRD. METHODS: Retrospective data was analyzed from 203 patients with TRD who received repeat-dose IV ketamine. Safety was operationalized as hemodynamic changes. Tolerability was evaluated through the reporting of adverse events and dissociation symptom severity, as measured by the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale. RESULTS: Ketamine was well-tolerated, with less than 5% of patients withdrawing due to tolerability concerns. Blood pressure significantly increased during infusion, with 44.3% meeting criteria for treatment-emergent hypertension (i.e., blood pressure ≥ 165/100 mmHg). 12% of patients exhibiting hypertension required pharmacological intervention. The most frequently reported adverse events included drowsiness (56.4%), dizziness (45.2%), dissociation (35.6%), and nausea (13.3%). Dissociation severity significantly attenuated after the first infusion, but plateaued for subsequent infusions. CONCLUSION: Intravenous ketamine was safe and well-tolerated. Hypertension was commonly observed and was often transient. Dissociation was most frequently reported after the first infusion but remained a consistent but not treatment-limiting adverse event thereafter.

To assess the analgesic efficacy of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist S(+)-ketamine on fibromyalgia pain, the authors performed a randomized double blind, active placebo-controlled trial. Twenty-four fibromyalgia patients were randomized to receive a 30-min intravenous infusion with S(+)-ketamine (total dose 0.5mg/kg, n=12) or the active placebo, midazolam (5mg, n=12). Visual Analogue Pain Scores (VAS) and ketamine plasma samples were obtained for 2.5-h following termination of treatment; pain scores derived from the fibromyalgia impact questionnaire (FIQ) were collected weekly during an 8-week follow-up. Fifteen min after termination of infusion the number of patients showing a reduction in pain scores >50% was 8 vs. 3 (P<0.05), at t=180min 6 vs. 2 (ns), at the end of week-1 2 vs. 0 (ns) and at end of week-8 2 vs. 2 in the ketamine and midazolam groups, respectively. Ketamine effect on VAS closely followed ketamine plasma concentrations. For VAS and FIQ scores no significant differences in treatment effects were observed in the 2.5-h following infusion or during the 8-week follow-up. Side effects as measured by the Bowdle questionnaire (which scores for 13 separate psychedelic symptoms) were mild to moderate in both study groups and declined rapidly, indicating adequate blinding of treatments. Efficacy of ketamine was limited and restricted in duration to its pharmacokinetics.

Protection of subjects in psychiatric research is an issue of considerable public and professional interest. Perhaps the most hotly debated issue concerns challenge study protocols where symptoms of illness are increased in a bioassay designed to gain knowledge of pathophysiology. Although widely used in biomedical research, the ethics of this application in mental illness research are contested. At issue is whether acute distress and lasting harm are caused without direct benefit in vulnerable subjects without valid informed consent. The ketamine challenge study in schizophrenia subjects is at the vortex of the current debate. This report presents background data on ketamine safety and a qualitative and quantitative analysis of data from all schizophrenia subjects in North American ketamine studies. Duration and severity of change in psychosis and anxiety, ""worst case"" experiences, and information on prolonged adverse effects are detailed. The vulnerable population and informed consent issue is discussed. Group results show that psychosis increase is mild to moderate and brief, anxiety is mild and brief, and no evidence of prolonged adverse effects is found. Few ""worst case"" incidents were identified, and these were clinically managed successfully in a short time period. Although more difficult to evaluate, informed consent procedures seem adequate, and consent was voluntary in subjects judged to have decisional capacity for this purpose and in circumstances where alternative clinical care could be freely chosen.

4784,"Social anxiety and MDMA-assisted therapy investigation: a novel clinical trial protocol.^
BACKGROUND: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a serious and prevalent psychiatric condition that heavily impacts social functioning and quality of life. Though efficacious treatments exist for SAD, remission rates remain elevated and a significant portion of those affected do not access effective treatment, suggesting the need for additional evidence-based treatment options. This paper presents a protocol for an open-label pilot study of MDMA-assisted therapy (MDMA-AT) for social anxiety disorder. The study aims to assess preliminary treatment outcomes, feasibility and safety, and psychological and physiological processes of change in the treatment of SAD with MDMA-AT. A secondary aim includes the development of a treatment manual for MDMA-AT for SAD. METHOD: The outlined protocol is a randomized, open-label delayed treatment study. We will recruit 20 participants who meet criteria with moderate-to-severe social anxiety disorder (SAD) of the generalized subtype. Participants will be randomly assigned to an immediate treatment (n = 10) or delayed treatment condition (n = 10). Those in the immediate treatment condition will proceed immediately to active MDMA-AT consisting of three preparation sessions, two medicine sessions in which they receive oral doses of MDMA, and six integration sessions over approximately a 16-week period. The delayed treatment condition will receive the same intervention after a 16-week delay. Our primary outcome is SAD symptom reduction as measured by the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale administered by blinded raters at post-treatment and 6 month follow up. Secondary outcomes include changes in functional impairment, feasibility and safety measures, and novel therapeutic processes of change including shame and shame-related coping, belongingness, self-concealment, and self-compassion at post-treatment. Exploratory outcomes are also discussed. DISCUSSION: The results of this pilot trial advance the field's understanding of the acceptability and potential effectiveness of MDMA-AT for social anxiety disorder and provide an overview of relevant therapeutic mechanisms unique to SAD.

5703,"Ketamine modulates fronto-striatal circuitry in depressed and healthy individuals.^
Ketamine improves motivation-related symptoms in depression but simultaneously elicits similar symptoms in healthy individuals, suggesting that it might have different effects in health and disease. This study examined whether ketamine affects the brain's fronto-striatal system, which is known to drive motivational behavior. The study also assessed whether inflammatory mechanisms-which are known to influence neural and behavioral motivational processes-might underlie some of these changes. These questions were explored in the context of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of ketamine in 33 individuals with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (TRD) and 25 healthy volunteers (HVs). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) was acquired 2 days post-ketamine (final sample: TRD n = 27, HV n = 19) and post-placebo (final sample: TRD n = 25, HV n = 18) infusions and was used to probe fronto-striatal circuitry with striatal seed-based functional connectivity. Ketamine increased fronto-striatal functional connectivity in TRD participants toward levels observed in HVs while shifting the connectivity profile in HVs toward a state similar to TRD participants under placebo. Preliminary findings suggest that these effects were largely observed in the absence of inflammatory (C-reactive protein) changes and were associated with both acute and sustained improvements in symptoms in the TRD group. Ketamine thus normalized fronto-striatal connectivity in TRD participants but disrupted it in HVs independently of inflammatory processes. These findings highlight the potential importance of reward circuitry in ketamine's mechanism of action, which may be particularly relevant for understanding ketamine-induced shifts in motivational symptoms.",1,"[0.0026698349975049496, 0.9973301887512207]",1

Here we describe treatment trajectories of three participants in the ongoing trial to illustrate the range of experiences and persisting effects of psilocybin treatment. Although it is difficult to generalize from a few cases, several qualitative conclusions can be drawn from the data presented here. Although participants often find it difficult to describe much of their psilocybin experience, pivotal moments tend to be individualized, extremely vivid, and memorable. Often, the qualitative content extends beyond the clinical problem that is being addressed. The participants discussed in this paper experienced acute and lasting alterations in their perceptions of self, in the quality of their baseline consciousness, and in their relationship with alcohol and drinking. In these cases, experiences of catharsis, forgiveness, self-compassion, and love were at least as salient as classic mystical content. Finally, feelings of increased ""spaciousness"" or mindfulness, and increased control over choices and behavior were reported following the drug administration sessions. Ultimately, psilocybin-assisted treatment appears to elicit experiences that are extremely variable, yet seem to meet the particular needs of the individual.",1,"[0.008230786770582199, 0.9917691946029663]",1
3012,"Potential Therapeutic Effects of Psilocybin: A Systematic Review.^
Psilocybin is a plant alkaloid that is derived from precursors of tryptamine and is present in many different types of mushrooms. It has been utilized by indigenous peoples of Central and South America for centuries in a ceremonial setting to promote spiritual experiences. Indigenous societies have long employed psilocybin and other 5-HT 2A agonist classic psychedelics in their rites. They were a focus in psychiatry in the middle of the 20th century as both experimental medicines and tools for studying brain function. Due to the fact that traditional psychedelics were being used for purposes other than medical research and in connection with the burgeoning counterculture by the late 1960s and early 1970s, these scientific investigations fell out of favor. However, thanks to a number of encouraging studies that validated the earlier research, interest in traditional psychedelics has surged among scientists in the 21st century. In this review, we examine therapeutic studies on psilocybin, the traditional psychedelic that has received the lion's share of recent attention. According to three controlled studies, psilocybin may reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety in the context of cancer-related psychological discomfort for at least six months after a single acute treatment for mood and anxiety disorders. Three months after two acute doses, individuals in a small, open-label study with treatment-resistant depression reported fewer depressive and anxiety symptoms. Small, open-label pilot studies on addiction have demonstrated encouraging success rates for alcohol and cigarette addiction. The review also briefly discusses the synthesis, mechanism of action, effects, molecular pharmacology, adverse effects, and contraindications of psilocybin.",0,"[0.9306418895721436, 0.06935807317495346]",1
9125,"Alterations to global but not local motion processing in long-term ecstasy (MDMA) users.^
RATIONALE: Growing evidence indicates that the main psychoactive ingredient in the illegal drug ""ecstasy"" (methylendioxymethamphetamine) causes reduced activity in the serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) systems in humans. On the basis of substantial serotonin input to the occipital lobe, recent research investigated visual processing in long-term users and found a larger magnitude of the tilt aftereffect, interpreted to reflect broadened orientation tuning bandwidths. Further research found higher orientation discrimination thresholds and reduced long-range interactions in the primary visual area of ecstasy users. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present research was to investigate whether serotonin-mediated V1 visual processing deficits in ecstasy users extend to motion processing mechanisms. METHOD: Forty-five participants (21 controls, 24 drug users) completed two psychophysical studies: A direction discrimination study directly measured local motion processing in V1, while a motion coherence task tested global motion processing in area V5/MT. RESULTS: ""Primary"" ecstasy users (n = 18), those without substantial polydrug use, had significantly lower global motion thresholds than controls [p = 0.027, Cohen's d = 0.78 (large)], indicating increased sensitivity to global motion stimuli, but no difference in local motion processing (p = 0.365). CONCLUSION: These results extend on previous research investigating the long-term effects of illicit drugs on visual processing. Two possible explanations are explored: defuse attentional processes may be facilitating spatial pooling of motion signals in users. Alternatively, it may be that a GABA-mediated disruption to V5/MT processing is reducing spatial suppression and therefore improving global motion perception in ecstasy users.",1,"[0.0027313982136547565, 0.9972686767578125]",1
7059,"Increased sensorimotor gating in recreational and dependent cocaine users is modulated by craving and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms.^
Background: Cocaine dependence has been associated with blunted dopamine and norepinephrine signaling, but it is unknown if recreational cocaine use is also associated with alterations of catecholamine systems. Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response - a measure of sensorimotor gating - is highly sensitive for manipulations of the catecholamine system. Therefore, we investigated whether relatively pure recreational users (RCU) and dependent cocaine users (DCU) display alterations of PPI, startle reactivity, and habituation. Moreover, the influences of methylenedioxymethamphetamine and cannabis co-use, craving, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms on startle measures were examined. Methods: In 64 RCU, 29 DCU, and 66 stimulant-naïve control subjects, PPI of acoustic startle response, startle reactivity, habituation, ADHD symptoms, and cocaine craving were assessed. Drug use of all participants was controlled by hair and urine toxicologies. Results: Both RCU and DCU showed increased PPI in comparison with control participants (Cohen's d=.38 and d=.67, respectively), while RCU and DCU did not differ in PPI measures (d=.12). No significant group differences were found in startle reactivity or habituation measures. In cocaine users, PPI was positively correlated with cumulative cocaine dose used, craving for cocaine, and ADHD symptoms. Users with a diagnosis of ADHD and strong craving symptoms displayed the highest PPI levels compared with control subjects (d=.78). Conclusions: The augmented PPI in RCU and DCU suggests that recreational use of cocaine is associated with altered catecholamine signaling, in particular if ADHD or craving symptoms are present. Finally, ADHD might be a critical risk factor for cocaine-induced changes of the catecholamine system. © 2013 Society of Biological Psychiatry.",0,"[0.977388858795166, 0.022611195221543312]",0
5786,"Preventive effect of oral magnesium in postmastectomy pain: protocol for a randomised, double-blind, controlled clinical trial.^
INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer affects 1 in 10 women worldwide, and mastectomy is a cause of chronic pain with neuropathic characteristics. N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists such as ketamine, memantine, dextromethorphan or magnesium are used to treat refractory pain by blocking NMDAR. Oral memantine has been shown to prevent postmastectomy pain and cognitive impact and to maintain quality of life. Likewise, the present study is intended to assess the preventive effect of oral magnesium, administered ahead of mastectomy, on the development of neuropathic pain. As a physiological blocker of NMDAR, magnesium could be an interesting candidate to prevent postoperative pain and associated comorbidities, including cognitive and emotional disorders, multiple analgesic consumption and impaired quality of life. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A randomised double‐blind controlled clinical trial (NCT03063931) will include 100 women with breast cancer undergoing mastectomy at the Oncology Hospital, Clermont‐Ferrand, France. Magnesium (100 mg/day; n=50) or placebo (n=50) will be administered for 6 weeks, starting 2 weeks before surgery. Intensity of pain, cognitive and emotional function and quality of life will be assessed by questionnaires. The primary endpoint is pain intensity on a 0‐10 numerical rating scale at 1 month postmastectomy. Data analysis will use mixed models; all tests will be two‐tailed, with type‐I error set at α=0.05. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol and informed consent form were approved in December 2016 by the French Research Ethics Committee (South East VI Committee). Results will be communicated in various congresses and published in international publications. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03063931.",0,"[0.9779663681983948, 0.022033652290701866]",0
2928,"Neuroendocrine responses of healthy volunteers to 'techno-music': relationships with personality traits and emotional state.^
A variety of studies reported psychological and physiological effects of music. Different types of music have been found to induce different neuroendocrine changes. The aim of the present experiment was to investigate the possible combination of emotional and endocrine changes in response to techno-music and to define personality variables as predictors of respective changes. Sixteen psychosomatically healthy subjects (18- to 19-year-olds, eight males and eight females) were exposed, in random order, to techno-music or to classical music (30 min each). Plasma norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (EPI), growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) cortisol (CORT), beta-endorphin (beta-EP) concentrations and changes of emotional state were measured in basal conditions and after the experimental trials with two different types of music. Techno-music was associated with a significant increase in heart rate, systolic blood pressure and significant changes in self-rated emotional states. A significant increase was observed in beta-EP, ACTH, NE, GH and CORT after listening to techno-music. Classical music induced an improvement in emotional state, but no significant changes in hormonal concentrations. No differences between male and female subjects' responses to music have been found. Plasma levels of PRL and EPI were unaffected by techno-and classical music. Changes in emotional state and NE, beta-EP and GH responses to techno-music correlated negatively with harm avoidance scores and positively with the novelty-seeking temperament score on the Cloninger scale. Listening to techno-music induces changes in neurotransmitters, peptides and hormonal reactions, related to mental state and emotional involvement: personality traits and temperament may influence the wide inter-individual variability in response to music.

692,"Relationships between reduction in symptoms and restoration of function and wellbeing: Outcomes of the Oral Ketamine Trial on Suicidality (OKTOS).^
Recovery of functioning is integral to successful treatment outcomes in depressive illness. Optimal antidepressant treatment results in both symptomatic remission and functional recovery. Oral ketamine rapidly reduces suicidality and depression; however, reports of functional and wellbeing outcomes are lacking. This study examines participants' social and occupational functioning and wellbeing outcomes in the Oral Ketamine Trial on Suicidality (OKTOS). Thirty adults with chronic suicidality participated in the trial over 10 weeks. Functional recovery and wellbeing were assessed using the Social and Occupational Functioning Scale (SOFAS) and World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5). Suicidality and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Beck Scale for Suicidal ideation (BSS) and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Relationships between the four treatment outcomes were analysed. Forty-three percent of participants achieved healthy function (SOFAS ≥ 80) and 27% reported healthy wellbeing (WHO-5 > 60%) at the four-week post-treatment follow-up. Wellbeing was revealed as the data-derived treatment endpoint for the sample. Effect sizes for functioning and wellbeing outcomes were smaller than for suicidality and depression outcomes. Results suggest that reduction in depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation may be necessary but not sufficient for full restoration of function and wellbeing in antisuicidal and antidepressant therapy, including clinical trials.",1,"[0.003399200737476349, 0.9966008067131042]",1
7282,"Cognitive enhancement effects of stimulants: a randomized controlled trial testing methylphenidate, modafinil, and caffeine.^
Rational At all times humans have made attempts to improve their cognitive abilities by different means, among others, with the use of stimulants. Widely available stimulants such as caffeine, but also prescription substances such as methylphenidate and modafinil, are being used by healthy individuals to enhance cognitive performance. Objectives There is a lack of knowledge on the effects of prescription stimulants when taken by healthy individuals (as compared with patients) and especially on the effects of different substances across different cognitive domains. Methods We conducted a pilot study with three arms in which male participants received placebo and one of three stimulants (caffeine, methylphenidate, modafinil) and assessed cognitive performance with a test battery that captures various cognitive domains. Results Our study showed some moderate effects of the three stimulants tested. Methylphenidate had positive effects on self-reported fatigue as well as on declarative memory 24 hours after learning; caffeine had a positive effect on sustained attention; there was no significant effect of modafinil in any of the instruments of our test battery. All stimulants were well tolerated, and no trade-off negative effects on other cognitive domains were found. Conclusions The few observed significant positive effects of the tested stimulants were domain-specific and of rather low magnitude. The results can inform the use of stimulants for cognitive enhancement purposes as well as direct further research to investigate the effects of stimulants on specific cognitive domains that seem most promising, possibly by using tasks that are more demanding.",0,"[0.9827342629432678, 0.0172656811773777]",0
2670,"Comparison of local spectral modulation, and temporal correlation, of simultaneously recorded EEG/fMRI signals during ketamine and midazolam sedation.^
Rationale and objectives: The identification of biomarkers of drug action can be supported by non-invasive brain imaging techniques, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), with simultaneous collection plausibly overcoming the limitations of either modality alone. Despite this, few studies have assessed the feasibility and utility of recording simultaneous EEG/fMRI in a drug study. Methods: We used simultaneous EEG/fMRI to assess the modulation of neural activity by ketamine and midazolam, in a placebo-controlled, single-blind, three-way cross-over design. Specifically, we analysed the sensitivity and direction of the spectral effects of each modality and the temporal correlations between the modulations of power of the common EEG bands and the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal. Results and conclusions: Demonstrating feasibility, local spectral effects were similar to those found in previous non-simultaneous EEG and fMRI studies. Ketamine administration resulted in a widespread reduction of BOLD fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF) and a diverse pattern of effects in the different EEG bands. Midazolam increased fALFF in occipital, parietal, and temporal areas, and frontal delta and beta EEG power. While EEG spectra were more sensitive to pharmacological modulations than the fALFF bands, there was no clear spatial relationship between the two modalities. Additionally, ketamine modulated the temporal correlation strengths between the theta EEG band and the BOLD signal, whereas midazolam altered temporal correlations with the alpha and beta bands. Taken together, these results demonstrate the utility of simultaneous recording: each modality provides unique insights, and combinatorial analyses elicit more information than separate recordings.

2265,"Psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy for depression: How dire is the need? How could we do it?.^
Despite the popular support for psychedelics as aids for depression, academics and the public frequently overestimate the efficacy of available medications and psychotherapies. Metaanalyses reveal that antidepressant medications alone help only one in four patients and rarely surpass credible placebos. Their effects, though statistically significant, might not impress depressed patients themselves. Psychotherapies create better outcomes than antidepressant drugs alone; combining the two provides measurable advantages. Nevertheless, the best combinations help only 65% of the clients who complete treatment. The drugs create side-effects and withdrawal surprisingly more severe than professional guidelines imply, too. Psychedelics appear to improve depression through some of the same mechanisms as psychotherapy, as well as some novel ones, suggesting that the combination could work very well. In addition, subjective experiences during the psychedelic sessions covary with improvement. Guiding clients to focus on these targeted thoughts and feelings could improve outcome. These data underscore the serious need for clinical trials of psychedelic-assisted, empirically supported treatment for depression with guided experiences during the psychedelic session. These trials would require important components to maximize their impact, including meaningful preparatory sessions designed to enhance motivation and explain empirically supported approaches, guided administration sessions that focus on oceanic boundlessness, integration sessions that support progress, and follow-up sessions consistent with established research. This combination involves markedly more than a simple pairing of medication and talk therapy, but proper application could have an unparalleled impact on public health.

Methylphenidate and modafinil are increasingly used as performance enhancers or ""smart drugs"" by students. 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""Ecstasy"") is widely used as recreational drug to enhance emotions. We plan to investigate effects of these psychostimulants on emotion‐processing and cognitive performance using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques. Single doses of methylphenidate (60mg), modafinil (600mg), MDMA (125mg), or placebo will be administered before an fMRI scan in a placebo‐controlled, randomized cross‐over study design in 24 healthy subjects. Subjective emotional effects, sociability, neurohormonal, cardiovascular responses, and plasma drug concentrations will also be assessed and analyzed for potential brain‐induced changes in brain activity in networks processing emotions. The primary hypothesis is that these psychostimulants differentially affect processing of emotional stimuli and potentially leading to alterations in social cognition and behavior. The work should clarify the neuropharmacological basis of the potentially differential effects of these drugs. This information will improve our understanding of the neurofunctional effects of methylphenidate, modafinil, and MDMA, and inform the ongoing debate surrounding brain doping with cognitive and mood enhancers.",1,"[0.0029853982850909233, 0.9970146417617798]",1

BACKGROUND: Excitotoxicity may contribute to neuronal degeneration in Huntington's disease (HD). N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists can prevent neuronal degeneration caused by excitotoxicity, but their effects in HD patients are not known. METHODS: We investigated the acute cognitive, behavioral, and motor effects of the NMDA-receptor antagonist ketamine in HD patients. Double-blind infusions of 0.10, 0.40, and 0.60 mg/kg/hr ketamine were given to 10 HD patients on one test day and compared with placebo infusions on a second, identical testing day. Linear mixed-effects models and randomization tests were used to identify whether, and at which dose, a significant change from baseline occurred in outcome variables. RESULTS: We demonstrated that ketamine is well tolerated at low and intermediate subanesthetic doses. Intermediate ketamine doses produced specific decline in memory and verbal fluency. Higher subanesthetic doses caused a significant increase in psychiatric symptoms and impairment of eye movements. CONCLUSIONS: These results describe the spectrum of clinical effects produced by increasing NMDA receptor blockade in HD patients. The clinical effects appearing with higher levels of NMDA receptor blockade can identify the range of doses used in clinical trials of NMDA receptor antagonists.",1,"[0.002519175410270691, 0.9974808096885681]",1
5471,"Psychedelic assisted therapy for major depressive disorder: Recent work and clinical directions.^
Psychedelic substances such as psilocybin and ketamine may represent the future of antidepressant treatment, due to their rapid and prolonged effects on mood and cognition. The current body of psychedelic research has focused on administration and treatment within a psychiatric context. Here, instead, we put to the test the contention that it is necessary to evaluate the current state of this literature from a broader biopsychosocial perspective. Examining these arguably neglected social and psychological aspects of psychedelic treatment can provide a more holistic understanding of the interplay between the interconnected domains. This review of six major clinical trials applies a biopsychosocial model to evaluate the antidepressant effects of psilocybin and ketamine assisted therapy. We conclude that combination psychedelic treatment and psychotherapy facilitate more enduring and profound antidepressant effects than produced by ketamine or psilocybin alone. Emphasising the advantages of therapeutic intervention will encourage those who may attempt to self-medicate with psychedelics to instead seek a framework of psychological support, minimising associated risks of unregulated use.

Impulsivity is a multidimensional, cross-diagnostic behavioural construct that has been described in various psychiatric disorders including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Tourette syndrome (TS). Different interpretations of results in the past have raised the question of heightened impulsivity as an explanatory model for self-described impulsive behaviour, especially in OCD. Our study included 16 patients with OCD, 14 patients with TS, and 28 healthy control subjects (HC). Self-assessed impulsivity was examined by the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 (BIS-11), and the behavioural test used was the immediate and delayed memory task (IMT/DMT). Significantly heightened self-assessed impulsivity of the patient collective compared to HC could be observed in in only one dimension: lack of attention (χ2 (2) = 24.910, p < 0.001). Post-hoc tests were performed using Bonferroni adjusted alpha levels of 0.0167 per test (0.05/3) and revealed significantly higher scores in patients with OCD (M = 19.57, SD = 2.82), z = 4.292, p < 0.001 as with TS (M = 19.38, SD = 3.62), z = 3.832, p < 0.001 compared to HC (M = 13.78, SD = 3.18). In patients with OCD, correlations between the dimension of obsessive thoughts with a lack of attention in the form of first-order factor cognitive instability could be shown (n = 14, p = 0.024, rs = 0.599) while in patients with TS, tic symptomatology correlated significantly with second-order factor attentional impulsivity (n = 12, p = 0.027, rs = 0.635). In behavioural testing, no significant group differences could be observed either in impulsive behaviour (IMT: χ2 (2) = 4.709, p = 0.824; DMT: χ2 (2) = 0.126, p = 0.939) or in sustained attention (IMT: χ2 (2) = 0.388, p = 0.095; DMT: χ2 (2) = 0.663, p = 0.718). Heightened impulsivity as an explanatory model for the observed lack of attention, especially in patients with OCD, should be questioned and interpretation biases considered in the future.

7074,"Effects of ketamine on explicit and implicit suicidal cognition: a randomized controlled trial in treatment-resistant depression.^
BACKGROUND: Preliminary evidence suggests intravenous ketamine has rapid effects on suicidal cognition, making it an attractive candidate for depressed patients at imminent risk of suicide. In the first randomized controlled trial of ketamine using an anesthetic control condition, we tested ketamine's acute effects on explicit suicidal cognition and a performance-based index of implicit suicidal cognition (Implicit Association Test; IAT) previously linked to suicidal behavior. METHOD: Symptomatic patients with treatment-resistant unipolar major depression (inadequate response to ≥3 antidepressants) were assessed using a composite index of explicit suicidal ideation (Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation, Montgomery-Asberg Rating Scale suicide item, Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms suicide item) and the IAT to assess suicidality implicitly. Measures were taken at baseline and 24 hr following a single subanesthetic dose of ketamine (n = 36) or midazolam (n = 21), a psychoactive placebo agent selected for its similar, rapid anesthetic effects. Twenty four hours postinfusion, explicit suicidal cognition was significantly reduced in the ketamine but not the midazolam group. RESULTS: Fifty three percent of ketamine-treated patients scored zero on all three explicit suicide measures at 24 hr, compared with 24% of the midazolam group (χ(2) = 4.6; P = .03). Implicit associations between self- and escape-related words were reduced following ketamine (P = .01; d = .58) but not midazolam (P = .68; d = .09). Ketamine-specific decreases in explicit suicidal cognition were largest in patients with elevated suicidal cognition at baseline, and were mediated by decreases in nonsuicide-related depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous ketamine produces rapid reductions in suicidal cognition over and above active placebo.

Standardised mean difference was used for continuous outcomes. Results: Twenty-five reports from 15 independent trials, with a total of 572 participants diagnosed with predominately affective disorders, were included. The evidence was rated moderate to low. In most trials, ketamine was administered at 0.5 mg/kg via a single intravenous infusion over a 30- to 45-minute period. Only a single trial of intranasal esketamine was identified. At 4 hours post-infusion, treatment with ketamine was associated with a significant reduction in suicidal ideation scores (standardised mean difference = −0.51, 95% confidence interval = [−1.00, −0.03]), which persisted until 72 hours post-infusion (time points between 12 and 24 hours: standardised mean difference = −0.63, 95% confidence interval = [−0.99, −0.26]; between 24 and 72 hours: standardised mean difference = −0.57, 95% confidence interval = [−0.99, −0.14]), but not thereafter. However, there was marked heterogeneity of results. In a single trial of esketamine, marginal effects on suicidal ideation were observed. In terms of actual suicidal behaviour, there were virtually no data on effects of ketamine or esketamine. Conclusion: A single infusion of ketamine may have a short-term (up to 72 hours) beneficial impact on suicidal thoughts. While confirmation of these results in further trials is needed, they suggest possible use of ketamine to treat acute suicidality. Means of sustaining any anti-suicidal effect need to be found.

782,"Spatiotemporal brain dynamics of emotional face processing modulations induced by the serotonin 1A/2A receptor agonist psilocybin.^
Emotional face processing is critically modulated by the serotonergic system. For instance, emotional face processing is impaired by acute psilocybin administration, a serotonin (5-HT) 1A and 2A receptor agonist. However, the spatiotemporal brain mechanisms underlying these modulations are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the spatiotemporal brain dynamics underlying psilocybin-induced modulations during emotional face processing. Electrical neuroimaging analyses were applied to visual evoked potentials in response to emotional faces, following psilocybin and placebo administration. Our results indicate a first time period of strength (i.e., Global Field Power) modulation over the 168-189 ms poststimulus interval, induced by psilocybin. A second time period of strength modulation was identified over the 211-242 ms poststimulus interval. Source estimations over these 2 time periods further revealed decreased activity in response to both neutral and fearful faces within limbic areas, including amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus, and the right temporal cortex over the 168-189 ms interval, and reduced activity in response to happy faces within limbic and right temporo-occipital brain areas over the 211-242 ms interval. Our results indicate a selective and temporally dissociable effect of psilocybin on the neuronal correlates of emotional face processing, consistent with a modulation of the top-down control.",1,"[0.003743065521121025, 0.996256947517395]",1

6703,"Who takes the trip? Personality and hallucinogen use among college students and adolescents.^
Research examining hallucinogen use has identified potential benefits, as well as potential harms, associated with use. The acute effects of hallucinogen use can be intense, disorienting, cognitively impairing, and may result in perceptual changes mimicking aspects of temporary psychosis. Hallucinogen use may also lead to the onset of more chronic issues, such as Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder, which impairs daily functioning even when sober. However, research on factors that predict who will misuse hallucinogens is an understudied area. In particular, while sensation seeking, impulsivity, and emotion dysregulation have all been shown to be predictive of problematic substance misuse, there is almost no research on how these personality variables predict hallucinogen use. The present study assessed how these personality traits predicted hallucinogen use in a sample of college undergraduates (N = 10,251) and a sample of adolescents in an inpatient residential psychiatric hospital (N = 200). Results indicated that facets of sensation seeking, impulsivity, and emotion dysregulation positively predicted ever having used hallucinogens, earlier initiation of use, and lifetime use among college students. Findings also indicated that facets of sensation seeking, impulsivity, and emotion dysregulation positively predicted having ever used hallucinogens in the adolescent inpatient sample. Results highlight the need for more research on who is likely to misuse hallucinogens. If confirmed in future research, the findings presented herein indicate viable personality variables as predictors. This is especially important as there has been a recent explosion of research on the positive benefits of therapeutic hallucinogen use.",1,"[0.014221329241991043, 0.9857786893844604]",1
2547,"Discontinuation of medications classified as reuptake inhibitors affects treatment response of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.^
RATIONALE: MDMA-assisted psychotherapy is under investigation as a novel treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The primary mechanism of action of MDMA involves the same reuptake transporters targeted by antidepressant medications commonly prescribed for PTSD. OBJECTIVES: Data were pooled from four phase 2 trials of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. To explore the effect of tapering antidepressant medications, participants who had been randomized to receive active doses of MDMA (75-125 mg) were divided into two groups (taper group (n = 16) or non-taper group (n = 34)). METHODS: Between-group comparisons were made for PTSD and depression symptom severity at the baseline and the primary endpoint, and for peak vital signs across two MDMA sessions. RESULTS: Demographics, baseline PTSD, and depression severity were similar between the taper and non-taper groups. At the primary endpoint, the non-taper group (mean = 45.7, SD = 27.17) had a significantly (p = 0.009) lower CAPS-IV total scores compared to the taper group (mean = 70.3, SD = 33.60). More participants in the non-taper group (63.6%) no longer met PTSD criteria at the primary endpoint than those in the taper group (25.0%). The non-taper group (mean = 12.7, SD = 10.17) had lower depression symptom severity scores (p = 0.010) compared to the taper group (mean = 22.6, SD = 16.69). There were significant differences between groups in peak systolic blood pressure (p = 0.043) and diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.032).

6030,"Investigation of Serotonin Neurotransmission in MDMA Users Using Combinated Dexfenfluramine Challenge and PET Imaging.^
Illicit use of the psychostimulant ""Ecstasy"" (3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA) is considered a major public health issue. In Switzerland, MDMA and congeners are ‐ after cannabis and cocaine ‐ number three in the ranking of the most popular illicit drugs. Worldwide, Ecstasy is estimated to be even the second most popular illicit drug, used by millions of regular users. On the basis of animal data, it is likely that MDMA at high or cumulative doses damages serotonin (5‐HT) neurons in the human brain. However, because of a multitude of methodological problems and a limited number of studies conducted in human subjects, no firm conclusions can yet be established whether chronic MDMA exposure produces a long lasting 5‐HT deficiency syndrome, with consequent neuropsychiatric risks. To further address the putative neurotoxicity of MDMA in the human brain, we propose that novel functional assays of serotonergic neurotransmission may be useful to clarify this issue. We suggest that a 5‐HT challenge study using positron emission tomography (PET) in conjunction with the 5‐HT releaser dexfenfluramine [(+)FEN] may test the functional integrity of the 5‐HT system in the living human brain. Specifically, in a placebo‐controlled study, the 5‐HT release capacity of serotonergic neurons shall be investigated by assessing [18F]‐altanserin binding to 5‐HT2A receptors following (+)FEN challenge in former and continuing MDMA users, and age and sex‐matched MDMA‐naïve controls. (+)FEN is a potent serotonin releaser without relevant affinity for 5‐HT, dopamine (DA) or norepinephrine (NE) receptors, and devoid of acute adverse effects in man. This makes (+)FEN an ideal pharmacological probe to explore functional integrity of serotonin neurotransmission. A second aim of our investigation is to detect possible impairments of cognitive functions and to study their relationship to serotonin neurotransmission as indexed by PET. In the course of the neuroimaging study, the investigators therefore also measure cognitive (e.g. attention, visual and working memory, learning, executive function) and affective functions (e.g. anxiety, impulsivity), suspected to be altered due to chronic MDMA use. Using correlational analyses, the investigators aim to determine if circumscribed regions of altered 5‐HT function are associated with specific impairments in cognitive and/or behavioural parameters. We hypothesize that (+)FEN‐evoked 5‐HT release will discernibly alter availability of 5‐HT2A receptors to [18F]‐altanserin, with a pattern revealing the spatially heterogeneous vulnerability of 5‐HT innervations to MDMA. The investigators predict that [18F]‐altanserin volume of distribution (DV) will decline following (+)FEN challenge to a lesser extent in current MDMA users compared to MDMA‐naïve control subjects. On the basis of animal data and recent neuroimaging studies in humans, the investigators hypothesize that functional recovery in former MDMA users will be manifest by a normalization or overshoot of the 5‐HT release capacity. Our methodology will allow us to quantitatively assess serotonergic functions in the living human brain. The novel combination of (+)FEN‐induced release of 5‐HT from intracellular storage vesicles and subsequent PET assessment of competitively altered [18F]‐altanserin binding at postsynaptic 5‐HT2A receptors will provide a more direct biological marker of in vivo serotonin function than has been hitherto available. By applying this new pharmacological challenge/PET neuroimaging approach to groups of current and former users of MDMA, the investigators shall be able to gain important new insight in the debated functional consequences of MDMA use, especially concerning the controversy about the reversibility of 5‐HT changes following cessation of MDMA use. Successful completion of this project should have useful implications for public education and harm reduction with respect to MDMA use, and may also facilitate the development of possible treatment options for chr nic MDMA users.",1,"[0.0031330438796430826, 0.9968670010566711]",1
3045,"Therapeutic potential of ayahuasca in grief: a prospective, observational study.^
RATIONALE: Recent studies have assessed the therapeutic potential of ayahuasca for the treatment of depression with promising preliminary results. OBJECTIVES: Here, we examine the course of grief over 1 year of follow-up in a bereaved sample that attended a center in Peru to participate in indigenous Shipibo ayahuasca ceremonies. We also explore the roles of experiential avoidance and decentering as mechanisms of change. METHODS: Bereaved participants who attended the ayahuasca center responded to an online survey that included the Texas Revised Inventory of Grief, Symptom Assessment-45, WHO Quality of Life-Bref, Acceptance and Action Questionnaire, and Decentering. Baseline assessment was completed by 50 individuals (T0). Of these, 39 completed the post-assessment at 15 days (T1), 31 at 3 months (T2), 29 at 6 months (T3), and 27 at 12 months (T4) after leaving the retreat. Pearson's analysis was performed to examine the relationship between the severity of grief and mechanisms of change during the period of T0 and T1. RESULTS: A significant decrease in Texas Revised Inventory was observed at all time points (T1: Cohen's d = 0.84; T2: Cohen's d = 1.38; T3: Cohen's d = 1.16; T4: Cohen's d = 1.39). We found a relationship between experiential avoidance (r = 0.55; p < .01), decentering (r = - 0.47; p < .01), and a reduction in the severity of grief.

4031,"A statistical analysis plan for a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ethosuximide in patients with treatment-resistant depression.^
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: A recent striking advance in the treatment of depression has been the finding of rapid antidepressant effects in over 70% of patients with treatment‐resistant depression (TRD) using ketamine. However, the potential risk of addiction may limit its clinical use. Recent research revealed that blockade of N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor (NMDAR) dependent bursting activity in the lateral habenula (LHb) could mediate the fast antidepressant effects of ketamine. Further, LHb bursting plays an important role in the pathophysiology of depression that requires both NMDARs and low‐voltage‐sensitive T‐type calcium channels (T‐VSCCs). Ethosuximide, which is used to treat absence seizures, is a T‐VSCCs inhibitor, may be a novel drug candidate for depression. The objective of this clinical trial is to investigate the efficacy and safety of ethosuximide in patients with TRD. DESIGN: The study is a single center, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐group, two‐stage clinical trial. Forty patients with TRD will be randomly assigned to Group A (treatment group) or Group B (control group). In the first stage ethosuximide or placebo will be given for 2 weeks. In the second stage, escitalopram (or another antidepressant if escitalopram has been used before) will be given for the next 4 weeks for all trial patients to ensure effective treatment. The primary outcome measure is the Montgomery‐Ã…sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores. Secondary outcome measures include the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology‐Self Report score, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale scores, individual scores of MADRS, and Young Mania Rating Scale scores. All these scales are measured at baseline and at each treatment visit. Two‐way repeated measures analysis of variance is used to analyze the study outcomes. DISCUSSION: A statistical analysis plan is employed to enhance the transparency of the clinical trial and reduce the risks of outcome reporting bias and data‐driven results.",0,"[0.9339310526847839, 0.06606891006231308]",1

We studied the effects of intranasal dexmedetomidine combined with oral ketamine for premedication in children. One hundred and sixty children aged between 2 and 6 years were randomly allocated to one of four groups: 1 μg.kg(-1) intranasal dexmedetomidine with 3 mg.kg(-1) oral ketamine (Group 1); 1 μg.kg(-1) intranasal dexmedetomidine with 5 mg.kg(-1) oral ketamine (Group 2); 2 μg.kg(-1) intranasal dexmedetomidine with 3 mg.kg(-1) oral ketamine (Group 3); and 2 μg.kg(-1) intranasal dexmedetomidine with 5 mg.kg(-1) oral ketamine (Group 4). Sedation levels 10, 20 and 30 min after premedication were evaluated using a 5-point sedation scale. A 4-point emotional state score was used to evaluate patients when they were separated from their parents and their response to intravenous cannulation or facemask application. Approximately 90% of patients readily accepted premedication and onset times of acceptable sedation were similar in all four groups. Patients in Group 4 were significantly more sedated than those in Group 1 after 30 min (p = 0.036). A significantly higher proportion of patients in Group 3 (84%) and Group 4 (87%) accepted intravenous cannulation compared with those in Group 1 (40%) and Group 2 (54%) (p = 0.001).

Aim: To test the age, cohort, and period effect on past-year use trends in psychedelic drugs and ecstasy. Method: Data were from a repeated cross-sectional nationally representative household survey in Australia conducted every three years between 2001 and 2019. An age-period-cohort model was used to test the effect of age, birth cohort, and period on past year psychedelic and ecstasy use. Participants were between 18 and 80 years old at the time of the survey. The total sample size was 149,296 (Mean age = 45.8; 56% female). Past-year use of psychedelics and ecstasy were the key outcome variables. There were six birth cohorts that were derived in each survey: 1936–50, 1951–60, 1961–70, 1971–80, 1981–90, and 1991–2001. There were seven periods that coincided with survey years: 2001, 2004, 2007, 2010, 2013, 2016 and 2019. Age was treated as continuous. Results: Past-year use of both psychedelics and ecstasy decreased with age, b = −0.87, 95% CI [−1.14, −0.61] and b = −0.84, 95% CI [−1.08, −0.60].

2447,"Alcohol and drug use during sex and its association with sexually transmitted infections: a retrospective cohort study among young people aged under 25 years visiting Dutch STI clinics.^
Introduction Alcohol use and drug use are common behaviours among young people. STI positivity is higher in young people than in people aged above 25 years. While there is an increasing amount of knowledge about drug use during sex among men who have sex with men (MSM), data on this behaviour among young women and heterosexual men are scarce. Therefore, this study aims to assess the proportion and characteristics of women and heterosexual men aged under 25 years reporting alcohol and/or drug use during sex and its association with STI positivity. Methods Surveillance data of heterosexual individuals younger than 25 years visiting two Dutch STI clinics between 2016 and 2019 were assessed (n=11 714). We used multivariable logistic regression analyses to assess associations between alcohol and drug use during sex and STI positivity (Chlamydia trachomatis and/or Neisseria gonorrhoeae diagnosis), adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics (sex, age, ethnicity, educational level, socioeconomic status and urbanisation) and sexual behaviour (condom use, number of sex partners). Results Alcohol use during sex was reported by 45.3% (5311/11 714; 49.5% in men vs 43.2% in women, p<0.001) and drug use during sex by 22.0% (2580/11 714; 30.7% in men vs 17.6% in women, p<0.001). The most reported drugs were cannabis (17.9%), ecstasy (XTC)/methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) (6.9%) and cocaine (4.7%). The use of at least one of the following drugs (XTC/MDMA, cocaine, speed, ketamine, gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB)/gamma-butyrolactone (GBL), heroin, crystal meth and/or designer drugs) was significantly associated with STI positivity after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics (adjusted OR (aOR): 1.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.4), but this association did not remain significant after adjustment for sexual behaviour (aOR: 1.12, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.34). Significant associations between drug use during sex and inconsistent condom (aOR: 2.5, 95% CI 1.9 to 3.2) use and having four or more sex partners (aOR: 3.2, 95% CI 2.8 to 3.6) in the past 6 months were assessed. Discussion Alcohol and drug use during sex was highly prevalent among young women and heterosexual men visiting the STI clinic and drug use during sex was associated with an increased risk for STI, probably mediated by sexual behaviour. This indicates that a holistic health promotion strategy, addressing STI prevention and alcohol and drug use-related harm reduction, is important in this group. STI clinics should address this behaviour not only among MSM, but also among young women and heterosexual men.",0,"[0.975566565990448, 0.024433501064777374]",0

INTRODUCTION: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was originally treated as a neurodevelopmental disorder that occurs mainly in children and tends to diminish or disappear with age, but we now know that symptoms persist into adulthood in over 50% of ADHD patients. Undiagnosed individuals often turn to psychoactive substance to minimize the negative aspects of functioning and improve quality of life. METHODS: The study was conducted online using random sampling through a Facebook group administered by physicians and targeted to patients diagnosed with ADHD. The study was naturalistic and exploratory, therefore no hypothesis was made. 438 correctly completed questionnaires were received. Analysis of the results showed that people with ADHD turn to psychoactive substances relatively frequently. RESULTS: The most commonly used stimulants include alcohol, marijuana, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), amphetamine/methamphetamine, and psilocybin. In the study population, methylphenidate is the most commonly used drug among patients. After treatment with psychostimulants, the majority of respondents note a decrease in symptoms of hyperactivity disorder, especially in male patients.

Background: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one the most effective therapies for the treatment of patients with psychotic disorders. Ketamine increases the seizure duration after electroconvulsive therapy. However, the routine use of ketamine may be limited due to concerns about the side effects. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of ketamine and sodium thiopental on blood pressure and heart rate during and after electroconvulsive therapy. Methods: The study included 64 patients who were candidates for receiving electroconvulsive therapy seizures. Consequently, patients were divided into two groups of 32 patients. Each patient received drug randomly. The collected data were analyzed using independent t and chi-square tests. Findings: Mean arterial pressure (MAP) at the fifth (P = 0.001) and tenth (P = 0.003) minutes after the seizures was higher in ketamine group. Mean heart rate at the first (P = 0.020), fifth (P = 0.001) and tenth (P = 0.002) minutes after the seizures was significantly greater in ketamine group, too. In addition, the duration of seizures in ketamine group was significantly higher than the sodium thiopental group (P = 0.001). Conclusion: Although, anesthesia induced by ketamine during electroconvulsive therapy increased blood pressure, heart rate and seizure duration, but due to lower medical complication, ketamine is an appropriate option for anesthesia in electroconvulsive therapy.",1,"[0.013679900206625462, 0.9863200783729553]",1
2232,"Baseline delta sleep ratio predicts acute ketamine mood response in major depressive disorder.^
BACKGROUND: Electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep slow wave activity (SWA; EEG power between 0.6 and 4Hz) has been proposed as a marker of central synaptic plasticity. Decreased generation of sleep slow waves--a core feature of sleep in depression--indicates underlying plasticity changes in the disease. Various measures of SWA have previously been used to predict antidepressant treatment response. This study examined the relationship between baseline patterns of SWA in the first two NREM episodes and antidepressant response to an acute infusion of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist ketamine. METHODS: Thirty patients (20M, 10F, 18-65) fulfilling DSM-IV criteria for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD) who had been drug-free for two weeks received a single open-label infusion of ketamine hydrochloride (.5mg/kg) over 40 min. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) before and after ketamine infusion. Sleep recordings were obtained the night before the infusion and were visually scored. SWA was computed for individual artifact-free NREM sleep epochs, and averaged for each NREM episode. Delta sleep ratio (DSR) was calculated as SWA(NREM1)/SWA(NREM2). RESULTS: A significant positive correlation was observed between baseline DSR and reduced MADRS scores from baseline to Day 1 (r=.414, p=.02). LIMITATIONS: The sample size was relatively small (N=30) and all subjects had treatment-resistant MDD, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Further studies are needed to replicate and extend this observation to other patient groups. CONCLUSIONS: DSR may be a useful baseline predictor of ketamine response in individuals with treatment-resistant MDD.",1,"[0.002442351309582591, 0.9975576400756836]",1

While regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), as measured for example by [H215O]-Positron Emission Tomography (PET), is generally taken to reflect local neuronal energy consumption, the relationship between rCBF and local neuroelectrical activity, as measured by EEG using Low Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA), is less clear. The present investigation compared brain activity simultaneously recorded by [H215O]-PET and EEG–LORETA. Simultaneous PET and EEG recordings were obtained from 16 healthy volunteers after the administration of a placebo or the serotonergic agonist 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine. LORETA was performed on the EEG recordings to compute the intracortical distribution of neuroelectrical activity for seven EEG frequency bands. Raw activity images, as well as images of difference between the two treatment conditions, were visually compared between [H215O]-PET and EEG–LORETA. Some areas of brain activity detected by [H215O]-PET and EEG–LORETA overlapped, but each method also detected activity in areas not detected by the other method. Comparing the difference, images revealed little consistent regularity between treatment-induced changes in rCBF and neuroelectrical activity. These findings indicate that there may be little coupling of rCBF and local neuronal firing, at least during certain physiological activations. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.",0,"[0.9912618398666382, 0.008738124743103981]",1

9056,"The Watts Connectedness Scale: a new scale for measuring a sense of connectedness to self, others, and world.^
RATIONALE: A general feeling of disconnection has been associated with mental and emotional suffering. Improvements to a sense of connectedness to self, others and the wider world have been reported by participants in clinical trials of psychedelic therapy. Such accounts have led us to a definition of the psychological construct of 'connectedness' as 'a state of feeling connected to self, others and the wider world'. Existing tools for measuring connectedness have focused on particular aspects of connectedness, such as 'social connectedness' or 'nature connectedness', which we hypothesise to be different expressions of a common factor of connectedness. Here, we sought to develop a new scale to measure connectedness as a construct with these multiple domains. We hypothesised that (1) our scale would measure three separable subscale factors pertaining to a felt connection to 'self', 'others' and 'world' and (2) improvements in total and subscale WCS scores would correlate with improved mental health outcomes post psychedelic use. OBJECTIVES: To validate and test the 'Watts Connectedness Scale' (WCS). METHODS: Psychometric validation of the WCS was carried out using data from three independent studies. Firstly, we pooled data from two prospective observational online survey studies. The WCS was completed before and after a planned psychedelic experience. The total sample of completers from the online surveys was N = 1226. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis were performed, and construct and criterion validity were tested. A third dataset was derived from a double-blind randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing psilocybin-assisted therapy (n = 27) with 6 weeks of daily escitalopram (n = 25) for major depressive disorder (MDD), where the WCS was completed at baseline and at a 6-week primary endpoint. RESULTS: As hypothesised, factor analysis of all WCS items revealed three main factors with good internal consistency. WCS showed good construct validity. Significant post-psychedelic increases were observed for total connectedness scores (η2 = 0.339, p < 0.0001), as well as on each of its subscales (p < 0.0001). Acute measures of 'mystical experience', 'emotional breakthrough', and 'communitas' correlated positively with post-psychedelic changes in connectedness (r = 0.42, r = 0.38, r = 0.42, respectively, p < 0.0001). In the RCT, psilocybin therapy was associated with greater increases in WCS scores compared with the escitalopram arm (η(p)2 = 0.133, p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: The WCS is a new 3-dimensional index of felt connectedness that may sensitively measure therapeutically relevant psychological changes post-psychedelic use. We believe that the operational definition of connectedness captured by the WCS may have broad relevance in mental health research.",1,"[0.005586634390056133, 0.994413435459137]",0
6641,"Cognitive and Neurophysiological Recovery Following Electroconvulsive Therapy: A Study Protocol.^
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) employs the elective induction of generalizes seizures as a potent treatment for severe psychiatric illness. As such, ECT provides an opportunity to rigorously study the recovery of consciousness, reconstitution of cognition, and electroencephalographic (EEG) activity following seizures. Fifteen patients with major depressive disorder refractory to pharmacologic therapy will be enrolled (Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02761330). Adequate seizure duration will be confirmed following right unilateral ECT under etomidate anesthesia. Patients will then undergo randomization for the order in which they will receive three sequential treatments: etomidate + ECT, ketamine + ECT, and ketamine + sham ECT. Sessions will be repeated in the same sequence for a total of six treatments. Before each session, sensorimotor speed, working memory, and executive function will be assessed through a standardized cognitive test battery. After each treatment, the return of purposeful responsiveness to verbal command will be determined. At this point, serial cognitive assessments will begin using the same standardized test battery. The presence of delirium and changes in depression severity will also be ascertained. Sixty-four channel EEG will be acquired throughout baseline, ictal, and postictal epochs. Mixed-effects models will correlate the trajectories of cognitive recovery, clinical outcomes, and EEG metrics over time. This innovative research design will answer whether: (1) time to return of responsiveness will be prolonged with ketamine + ECT compared with ketamine + sham ECT; (2) time of restoration to baseline function in each cognitive domain will take longer after ketamine + ECT than after ketamine + sham ECT; (3) postictal delirium is associated with delayed restoration of baseline function in all cognitive domains; and (4) the sequence of reconstitution of cognitive domains following the three treatments in this study is similar to that occurring after an isoflurane general anesthetic (NCT01911195). Sub-studies will assess the relationships of cognitive recovery to the EEG preceding, concurrent, and following individual ECT sessions. Overall, this study will lead the development of biomarkers for tailoring the cogno-affective recovery of patients undergoing ECT.",1,"[0.01805586740374565, 0.9819440841674805]",1
7713,"Long-term neuropsychological effects of ecstasy in middle-aged ecstasy/polydrug users.^
Rationale: Studies reporting ecstasy-induced serotonin-toxicity and (neuro)psychological dysfunctions have been conducted in young adults. Little is known about ecstasy effects later in life, when serotonin levels and cognition decrease as a consequence of normal ageing. Objective: This study aimed to assess whether harmful effects of ecstasy only add to or also interact with age-related neuropsychological decline. Methods: Attention, verbal and visual memory, visuospatial ability, self-reported depression, sensation-seeking and impulsivity were assessed in middle-aged moderate to heavy ecstasy/polydrug users (n=17) and compared with none or very mild ecstasy using polydrug users (matched for age, gender, intelligence and other drugs; n=16) and a group of drug-naive controls (n=20). Results: Moderate to heavy ecstasy/polydrug users performed significantly worse on a verbal memory task than none or very mild ecstasy using polydrug users and drug naives. Moderate and heavy ecstasy/polydrug users also differed significantly from drug-naives on measures of depression, sensation-seeking and impulsivity but not from none or very mild ecstasy-using polydrug users. Conclusion: This study in middle-aged ecstasy/polydrug users replicated findings of studies in younger ecstasy users, showing a harmful effect of ecstasy on verbal memory. There was no clear support for an interaction between harmful effects of ecstasy use and age-related memory decline or mid-life depression. © 2009 The Author(s).",1,"[0.002755724126473069, 0.9972442388534546]",1

A method using an online solid-phase extraction (SPE) and ion-pairing liquid chromatography with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ES-MS/MS) was developed for determination of amphetamine (Amp), methamphetamine (mAmp), 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA), and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in urine samples. A SPE cartridge column with both hydrophilic and lipophilic functions was utilized for online extraction. A reversed-phase C18 LC column was employed for LC separation and MS/MS was used for detection. Trifluoroacetic acid was added to the mobile phase as an ion-pairing reagent. This method was fully automated and the extraction and analysis procedures were controlled by a six-port switch valve. Recoveries ranging from 85-101% were measured. Good linear ranges (10-500 ng/mL) for Amp and mAmp were determined. For MDA, MDMA and MDEA, dual linear ranges were obtained from 5-100 and 100-500ng/mL, respectively. The detection limit of each analytical compound, based on a signal-to-noise ratio of 3, ranged from 1-3 ng/mL. The applicability of this newly developed method was examined by analyzing several urine samples from drug users. Good agreement was obtained between the results from this method and a literature GC/MS method. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",0,"[0.982886016368866, 0.017113978043198586]",1
3419,"Ketamine and its metabolites: Potential as novel treatments for depression.^
The present article provides an overview of the papers presented in the special issue of 'Neuropharmacology '. Since the discovery of rapid and robust antidepressant effects of ketamine for patients with depression, including those with treatment resistant depression (TRD) research on antidepressant effects of ketamine has gained much attention. Throughout this Special Issue, molecules and events that are proposed to mediate the antidepressant effects of ketamine were proposed to be promising targets for drug discovery of novel agents mimicking ketamine-like antidepressants. Despite enormous efforts as described in this Special Issue, there are still many questions to be solved on ketamine research. Nonetheless, several compounds have been generated based on ketamine research, and efficacy and safety of some of these compounds are currently being tested in clinical trials. Depending on their results, which will be obtained in a next couple of years, we may need to reconsider precise mechanisms of ketamine as well as active component(s) of racemic ketamine.

6887,"Prevalence and impact of recreational drug use in patients with acute cardiovascular events.^
OBJECTIVE: While recreational drug use is a risk factor for cardiovascular events, its exact prevalence and prognostic impact in patients admitted for these events are not established. We aimed to assess the prevalence of recreational drug use and its association with in-hospital major adverse events (MAEs) in patients admitted to intensive cardiac care units (ICCU). METHODS: In the Addiction in Intensive Cardiac Care Units (ADDICT-ICCU) study, systematic screening for recreational drugs was performed by prospective urinary testing all patients admitted to ICCU in 39 French centres from 7 to 22 April 2021. The primary outcome was prevalence of recreational drug detection. In-hospital MAEs were defined by death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or haemodynamic shock. RESULTS: Of 1499 consecutive patients (63±15 years, 70% male), 161 (11%) had a positive test for recreational drugs (cannabis 9.1%, opioids 2.1%, cocaine 1.7%, amphetamines 0.7%, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) 0.6%). Only 57% of these patients declared recreational drug use. Patients who used recreational drugs exhibited a higher MAE rate than others (13% vs 3%, respectively, p<0.001). Recreational drugs were associated with a higher rate of in-hospital MAEs after adjustment for comorbidities (OR 8.84, 95% CI 4.68 to 16.7, p<0.001). After adjustment, cannabis, cocaine, and MDMA, assessed separately, were independently associated with in-hospital MAEs. Multiple drug detection was frequent (28% of positive patients) and associated with an even higher incidence of MAEs (OR 12.7, 95% CI 4.80 to 35.6, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of recreational drug use in patients hospitalised in ICCU was 11%. Recreational drug detection was independently associated with worse in-hospital outcomes.

822,"Importance of Exploring N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) as a Future Perspective Target in Depression.^
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a serious and complex mental illness. Currently, many antidepressants are available in the market for the treatment of MDD. However, these agents are associated with side effects, which restricts their use. This warrants the development of advanced anti-depressive medications with a novel mechanism of action or novel targets and with minimal adverse effects. The traditional neurobiological hypothesis of depression, the monoamine hypothesis, is unable to properly explain all the aspects of depressive conditions. In this review, we discuss novel approaches that could be used for the treatment of depression, including glutamatergic and serotonergic system modulation. The pathogenesis of depression is greatly affected by glutamatergic neurotransmission dysfunction. Previous investigations have shown that ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, exerts fast and long-lasting antidepressant effects. Several glutamatergic modulators, such as esketamine, sarcosine, and others, have also shown potential antidepressant action in animal as well as clinical studies. Lastly, drugs that alter neurotransmission by NMDA receptors could open up new avenues for more effective treatment of depression. Besides, understanding the underlying mechanisms will aid in the development of novel and fast-acting antidepressant drugs in the future.",0,"[0.9899892807006836, 0.010010672733187675]",0

121,"Comprehensive assessment of side effects associated with a single dose of ketamine in treatment-resistant depression.^
BACKGROUND: Concerns about ketamine for treating depression include abuse potential and the occurrence of psychotomimetic effects. This study sought to comprehensively assess side effects (SEs) associated with a single subanesthetic-dose intravenous ketamine infusion. A secondary aim was to examine the relationship between Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS) scores and dissociative symptoms reported on a comprehensive, clinician-administered SE questionnaire. METHODS: Data from 188 participants were pooled from four placebo-controlled, crossover ketamine trials and one open-label study (n = 163 with either treatment-resistant major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder and 25 healthy controls). SEs were actively solicited in a standardized fashion and monitored over the time-course of each study. Statistical analyses assessed the effect of drug (ketamine, placebo) on SEs and measured the relationship between CADSS total score and SEs contemporaneously endorsed during structured interviews. RESULTS: Forty-four of 120 SEs occurred in at least 5% of participants over all trials. Thirty-three of these 44 SEs were significantly associated with active drug administration (versus placebo). The most common SE was feeling strange/weird/loopy. Most SEs peaked within an hour of ketamine administration and resolved completely by two hours post-infusion. No serious drug-related adverse events or increased ketamine craving/abuse post-administration were observed. A positive correlation was found between dissociative SEs and total CADSS score. LIMITATIONS: The post-hoc nature of the analysis; the limited generalizability of a single subanesthetic-dose ketamine infusion; and the lack of formal measures to assess ketamine's cognitive, urological, or addictive potential. CONCLUSIONS: No long-lasting significant SEs occurred over the approximately three-month follow-up period.",1,"[0.002435053698718548, 0.9975649118423462]",1
6740,"The effects of a subanesthetic dose of ketamine on verbal memory in normal volunteers.^
RATIONALE: N-methyl-D: -aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonists have been reported to induce schizophrenia-like symptoms in humans, including memory impairments. Although the NMDA receptor has been shown to impair memory acquisition by disrupting long-term potentiation (LTP), limited research has been done on studying the effects of NMDA antagonists on the post-LTP cascade of events implicated in consolidation as measured by administering the drug after the initial learning experience. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this experiment was to examine the effect of ketamine on mental status and to identify NMDA antagonist-induced memory deficits by comparing the recall performance of items presented both immediately before and during ketamine infusion. METHODS: Thirteen normal controls received a 60-min infusion of ketamine in a randomized double-blind, cross-over design. Mental status was evaluated with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale. The first 12-item word list was presented immediately before infusion, and two lists were subsequently presented during the infusion. Verbal memory performance was assessed by measuring the delayed cued recall of each list 30 min after its presentation. RESULTS: At the beginning, subjects experienced perceptual and reality distortion symptoms, followed later by mild subjective effects. Ketamine significantly reduced the delayed recall of words presented immediately before, but not during, drug infusion. Ketamine-induced decrements in verbal recall correlated significantly with plasma ketamine levels. CONCLUSION: This study characterizes the behavioral effects associated with ketamine and suggests that ketamine decreases verbal memory performance by interfering with early consolidation processes.",1,"[0.0023057227954268456, 0.997694194316864]",1

In our procedure, the urine samples undergo solid-phase extraction (SPE) and derivatization prior to injection into the GC-MS device. Separation is performed using a HP-5MS capillary column. The use of selective ion monitoring (SIM mode) makes it is good sensitivity in this method, and the entire analysis process is within 18 min. In addition, the proposed method maintains linearity in the calibration curve from 50 to 2,000 ng/mL (r2 > 0.995). The limit of detection of this method is 5 ng/mL, with the exception of MDPV (20 ng/mL); the limit of quantification is 20 ng/mL, with the exception of MDPV (50 ng/mL). In testing, the extraction performance of SPE was between 82.34 and 104.46%. Precision and accuracy results were satisfactory <15%.

2354,"Connecting inflammation with glutamate agonism in suicidality.^
The NMDA-receptor antagonist ketamine has proven efficient in reducing symptoms of suicidality, although the mechanisms explaining this effect have not been detailed in psychiatric patients. Recent evidence points towards a low-grade inflammation in brains of suicide victims. Inflammation leads to production of quinolinic acid (QUIN) and kynurenic acid (KYNA), an agonist and antagonist of the glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, respectively. We here measured QUIN and KYNA in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 64 medication-free suicide attempters and 36 controls, using gas chromatography mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography. We assessed the patients clinically using the Suicide Intent Scale and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). We found that QUIN, but not KYNA, was significantly elevated in the CSF of suicide attempters (P<0.001). As predicted, the increase in QUIN was associated with higher levels of CSF interleukin-6. Moreover, QUIN levels correlated with the total scores on Suicide Intent Scale. There was a significant decrease of QUIN in patients who came for follow-up lumbar punctures within 6 months after the suicide attempt. In summary, we here present clinical evidence of increased QUIN in the CSF of suicide attempters. An increased QUIN/KYNA quotient speaks in favor of an overall NMDA-receptor stimulation. The correlation between QUIN and the Suicide Intent Scale indicates that changes in glutamatergic neurotransmission could be specifically linked to suicidality. Our findings have important implications for the detection and specific treatment of suicidal patients, and might explain the observed remedial effects of ketamine. © 2013 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

7917,"Synapses, predictions, and prediction errors: A neocortical computational study of MDD using the temporal memory algorithm of HTM.^
INTRODUCTION: Synapses and spines play a significant role in major depressive disorder (MDD) pathophysiology, recently highlighted by the rapid antidepressant effect of ketamine and psilocybin. According to the Bayesian brain and interoception perspectives, MDD is formalized as being stuck in affective states constantly predicting negative energy balance. To understand how spines and synapses relate to the predictive function of the neocortex and thus to symptoms, we used the temporal memory (TM), an unsupervised machine-learning algorithm. TM models a single neocortical layer, learns in real-time, and extracts and predicts temporal sequences. TM exhibits neocortical biological features such as sparse firing and continuous online learning using local Hebbian-learning rules. METHODS: We trained a TM model on random sequences of upper-case alphabetical letters, representing sequences of affective states. To model depression, we progressively destroyed synapses in the TM model and examined how that affected the predictive capacity of the network. We found that the number of predictions decreased non-linearly. RESULTS: Destroying 50% of the synapses slightly reduced the number of predictions, followed by a marked drop with further destruction. However, reducing the synapses by 25% distinctly dropped the confidence in the predictions. Therefore, even though the network was making accurate predictions, the network was no longer confident about these predictions. DISCUSSION: These findings explain how interoceptive cortices could be stuck in limited affective states with high prediction error. Connecting ketamine and psilocybin's proposed mechanism of action to depression pathophysiology, the growth of new synapses would allow representing more futuristic predictions with higher confidence. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use the TM model to connect changes happening at synaptic levels to the Bayesian formulation of psychiatric symptomatology. Linking neurobiological abnormalities to symptoms will allow us to understand the mechanisms of treatments and possibly, develop new ones.",0,"[0.9848037958145142, 0.015196161344647408]",0

Seizures represent the most common neurological emergency in ecstasy abusers; however, no study addressed whether (+/-) 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (""ecstasy"") per se might produce long-lasting alterations in brain excitability related to a pro-convulsant effect. C57 Black mice were treated with three regimens of (+/-) 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetarnine (5 mg/kg x 2 for 1, 2 or three consecutive days). Following the last dose of (+/-) 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, during a time interval of 8 weeks, the following procedures were carried out: 1) cortical electroencephalographic recordings, including power-spectrum analysis; 2) administration of sub-threshold doses of kainate; 3) measurement of regional [C-14]2-deoxyglucose uptake; 4) monoamine assay. We demonstrate that all mice pre-treated with (+/-) 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine showed long-lasting encephalographic changes with frequencies peaking at 3 - 4.5 Hz at the power-spectrum analysis. This is concomitant with latent brain hyperexcitability within selected limbic brain regions, as shown by seizure facilitation and long-lasting latent metabolic hyperactivity which can be unraveled by phasic glutamate stimulation. This study sheds new light into the brain targets of (+/-) 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine and discloses the occurrence of (+/-) 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-induced latent hyperexcitability within limbic areas, while it might provide a model to study in controlled experimental conditions limbic seizures and status epilepticus in C57 Black mice. Persistent changes produced by (+/-) 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine in limbic brain excitability might be responsible for seizures and limbic-related disorders in chronic (+/-) 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine abusers.

The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD) and facilitated by a data sharing agreement between NMCSD and the Defense Health Agency. Patient encounters from all US military operations from January 2010 to December 2019 were queried. All administrations of any pain medications via any route were included. Results: 5965 patients with a total of 8607 pain medication administrations were included. Between 2010 and 2019, the yearly percentage of ketamine administrations rose from 14.2% to 52.6% (p<0.001). The percentage of opioid administrations decreased from 85.8% to 47.4% (p<0.001). Among the 4104 patients who received a single dose of pain medication, the mean Injury Severity Score for those who received ketamine was higher than for those who received an opioid (mean=13.1 vs 9.8, p<0.001). Conclusion: Military opioid use declined as ketamine use increased over 10 years of combat. Ketamine is generally used first for more severely injured patients and has increasingly been employed by the US military as the primary analgesic for combat casualties.",0,"[0.9708129167556763, 0.029187114909291267]",0
4751,"Do motives of drug consumption depend on the number of substances used by adolescents.^
Drug consumption by adolescents causes social and health problems. This prospective study was designed to examine reasons for and against using substances such as tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana and to discover whether or not motives to use drugs vary with the number of drugs used. Method. - The participants were 886 adolescents from a suburban high school (Nancy, France), who answered a self-report questionnaire. Results. - The response rate was 95% (655 males and 175 females, mean age 17.5 ± 2.5years). The prevalence of current tobacco use, former tobacco use and never used was 40.7, 21.3 and 31.7%, respectively. For alcohol consumption, the results were 85.8, 3.5 and 0.7%, respectively and for marijuana consumption, 34.4, 18.3 and 47.3%, respectively. Ecstasy had already been used by 8.4% of the respondents. The main reasons given by the adolescents to explain why they did or did not use these substances varied with the number of drugs used. Conclusion. - This work shows an increasing deterioration of youths social relations (with his/her parents and with him/herself) that seem to depend on the number of drugs used. Further research is necessary to improve these results. © 2001 Editions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.",0,"[0.978847324848175, 0.021152736619114876]",0
2139,"Serotonergic hallucinogens/psychedelics could be promising treatments for depressive and anxiety disorders in end-stage cancer.^
In a recent issue of the BMC Psychiatry, the evidence of effectiveness of treatments for psychiatric conditions in end-stage cancer patients was reviewed (Johnson, 2018). The review was comprehensive, and included traditional and non-traditional/alternative treatments, including herbal medicines and spirituality. However, evidence showing that classic or serotonergic hallucinogens/psychedelics such as psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) could be effective treatments for depressive and anxiety disorders in end-stage cancer was not included. In this commentary, we expand the information available on the original article by briefly reviewing data from recent placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over clinical trials showing evidence that administration of single (or few) doses of LSD and psilocybin was associated with rapid and sustained reductions in depressive and anxiety symptoms in patients with end-stage cancer and other life-threatening diseases (e.g., Bechterew's disease, Parkinson's disease, Celiac disease). Since these substances seem to produce rapid and sustained therapeutic effects with single (or few) doses and well tolerated, large-scale, prospective, multi-site studies of end-stage cancer and classical/serotonergic hallucinogens/psychedelics should be performed to improve our understanding of the therapeutic potentials of these drugs and their use on clinical practice.",0,"[0.9900201559066772, 0.009979832917451859]",0
2256,"Efficacy of Intravenous Ketamine in Adolescent Treatment-Resistant Depression: A Randomized Midazolam-Controlled Trial.^
OBJECTIVE: Adolescent depression is prevalent and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Although intravenous ketamine has shown efficacy in adult treatment-resistant depression, its efficacy in pediatric populations is unknown. The authors conducted an active-placebo-controlled study of ketamine's safety and efficacy in adolescents. METHODS: In this proof-of-concept randomized, double-blind, single-dose crossover clinical trial, 17 adolescents (ages 13-17) with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder received a single intravenous infusion of either ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes) or midazolam (0.045 mg/kg over 40 minutes), and the alternate compound 2 weeks later. All participants had previously tried at least one antidepressant medication and met the severity criterion of a score >40 on the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised. The primary outcome measure was score on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) 24 hours after treatment. RESULTS: A single ketamine infusion significantly reduced depressive symptoms 24 hours after infusion compared with midazolam (MADRS score: midazolam, mean=24.13, SD=12.08, 95% CI=18.21, 30.04; ketamine, mean=15.44, SD=10.07, 95% CI=10.51, 20.37; mean difference=-8.69, SD=15.08, 95% CI=-16.72, -0.65, df=15; effect size=0.78). In secondary analyses, the treatment gains associated with ketamine appeared to remain 14 days after treatment, the latest time point assessed, as measured by the MADRS (but not as measured by the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised). A significantly greater proportion of participants experienced a response to ketamine during the first 3 days following infusion as compared with midazolam (76% and 35%, respectively). Ketamine was associated with transient, self-limited dissociative symptoms that affected participant blinding, but there were no serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In this first randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial of intravenous ketamine in adolescents with depression, the findings suggest that it is well tolerated acutely and has significant short-term (2-week) efficacy in reducing depressive symptoms compared with an active placebo.",1,"[0.0023569760378450155, 0.9976430535316467]",1
6894,"Family history of alcohol dependence and initial antidepressant response to an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist.^
BACKGROUND: A high rate of comorbidity exists between mood disorders and alcohol dependence. Furthermore, both ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic with a recently described rapid-onset antidepressant effect, and ethanol are N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists. Previous investigations of healthy individuals with a family history of alcohol dependence have found that these individuals have an attenuated response to ketamine's perceptual disturbance and dysphoric effects similar to that found in individuals with a self-reported history of alcohol dependence. This study investigated whether a family history of alcohol dependence influences ketamine's initial antidepressant effect. METHODS: Twenty-six subjects with DSM-IV treatment-resistant major depression were given an open-label intravenous infusion of ketamine hydrochloride (.5 mg/kg) and rated using various depression scales at baseline, 40, 80, 120, and 230 min postinfusion. The primary outcome measure was Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores. RESULTS: Subjects with a family history of alcohol dependence showed significantly greater improvement in MADRS scores compared with subjects who had no family history of alcohol dependence. CONCLUSIONS: A family history of alcohol dependence appears to predict a rapid initial antidepressant response to an NMDA receptor antagonist.",1,"[0.0030054571107029915, 0.9969944953918457]",1

The anthropological record on the use of ayahuasca is clear. Data shows that when hallucinogen-induced managed altered states of consciousness have been used under optimal conditions, positive and salutary outcomes have resulted. A multinational research group from the United States and Brazil was formed in 2000 to investigate the psychosocial and neurocognitive effects upon a group of 84 hoasca-ingesting adolescents and a matched control group of nonusers in three Brazilian cities (Sao Paulo, Campinas and Brasilia). Articles based on qualitative, neuropsychological and psychiatric assessments of these adolescents are presented in this issue of the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs (Vol 37[2]). Additionally, other scholars have participated in adding to current knowledge of the hoasca sacrament as used by the UDV church, and there are crosscultural contributions on ayahuasca use in South America and the United States and Spain.

2099,"A Single Dose of LSD Does Not Alter Gene Expression of the Serotonin 2A Receptor Gene (HTR2A) or Early Growth Response Genes (EGR1-3) in Healthy Subjects.^
Rationale: Renewed interest has been seen in the use of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in psychiatric research and practice. The repeated use of LSD leads to tolerance that is believed to result from serotonin (5-HT) 5-HT(2A) receptor downregulation. In rats, daily LSD administration for 4 days decreased frontal cortex 5-HT(2A) receptor binding. Additionally, a single dose of LSD acutely increased expression of the early growth response genes EGR1 and EGR2 in rat and mouse brains through 5-HT(2A) receptor stimulation. No human data on the effects of LSD on gene expression has been reported. Therefore, we investigated the effects of single-dose LSD administration on the expression of the 5-HT(2A) receptor gene (HTR2A) and EGR1-3 genes. Methods: mRNA expression levels were analyzed in whole blood as a peripheral biomarker in 15 healthy subjects before and 1.5 and 24 h after the administration of LSD (100 μg) and placebo in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Results: LSD did not alter the expression of the HTR2A or EGR1-3 genes 1.5 and 24 h after administration compared with placebo. Conclusion: No changes were observed in the gene expression of LSD's primary target receptor gene or genes that are implicated in its downstream effects. Remaining unclear is whether chronic LSD administration alters gene expression in humans.",1,"[0.0026388075202703476, 0.9973612427711487]",1
4911,"Default mode network connectivity change corresponds to ketamine’s delayed glutamatergic effects.^
Ketamine exerts rapid antidepressant effects peaking 24 h after a single infusion, which have been suggested to be reflected by both reduced functional connectivity (FC) within default mode network (DMN) and altered glutamatergic levels in the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC) at 24 h. Understanding the interrelation and time point specificity of ketamine-induced changes of brain circuitry and metabolism is thus key to future therapeutic developments. We investigated the correlation of late glutamatergic changes with FC changes seeded from the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and tested the prediction of the latter by acute fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF). In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of 61 healthy subjects, we compared effects of subanesthetic ketamine infusion (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min) on resting-state fMRI and MR-Spectroscopy at 7 T 1 h and 24 h post-infusion. FC decrease between PCC and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) was found at 24 h post-infusion (but not 1 h) and this FC decrease correlated with glutamatergic changes at 24 h in pg ACC. Acute increase in fALFF was found in ventral PCC at 1 h which was not observed at 24 h and inversely correlated with the reduced dPCC FC towards the dmPFC at 24 h. The correlation of metabolic and functional markers of delayed ketamine effects and their temporal specificity suggest a potential mechanistic relationship between glutamatergic modulation and reconfiguration of brain regions belonging to the DMN.

1689,"N-acetylaspartate (NAA) correlates inversely with cannabis use in a frontal language processing region of neocortex in MDMA (Ecstasy) polydrug users: A 3 T magnetic resonance spectroscopy study.^
Impaired verbal memory is common in MDMA (Ecstasy) polydrug users. The contributions of Ecstasy or polydrug exposure to reduced verbal memory are unclear, as is the neural basis for this cognitive deficit. Ecstasy users have reduced gray matter in brain regions mediating verbal memory (BA 18, 21 and 45). N-acetylaspartate (NAA) as a neuronal marker and myoinositol (mI) as a glial marker are inconsistently affected in Ecstasy users. We used 3 T MRS in 17 recreational drug users to test the hypothesis that Ecstasy polydrug use would be associated with altered NAA or mI in BA 18, 21 and 45. No effects were seen for mI. Metabolite ratios for NAA (mean ± SD) were: BA 18-NAA/Cr (2.030 ± 0.188); BA 21-NAA/Cr (1.861 ± 0.325); BA 45-NAA/Cr (1.925 ± 0.329). Lifetime cannabis use was significantly associated with BA 45 NAA/Cr (r = - 0.687, p = 0.014) but not with NAA in BA 18 or 21. In contrast, there were no statistically significant associations for lifetime use of Ecstasy, alcohol, or cocaine with NAA. These findings suggest that cannabis use may contribute to altered neuronal integrity in Ecstasy polydrug users in a brain region associated with verbal memory processing. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

4876,"The association between stage of treatment-resistant depression and clinical utility of ketamine/esketamine: A systematic review.^
OBJECTIVE: Ketamine has demonstrated rapid and significant antidepressant effects in patients with treatment resistant depression (TRD). Herein, we conducted a systematic review to determine ketamine's efficacy as a function of the stage of treatment resistance (e.g., number of failed treatments) among individuals with TRD. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed and Scopus from inception to August 2021 was conducted. Where applicable, the studies were categorized into low and high stages of resistance, where low category included studies where the mean number of failed antidepressants was <3 or had a higher proportion of subjects with ≤2 antidepressant trials. Reported indicators of treatment resistance and efficacy were extracted from randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) assessing ketamine or esketamine for TRD. RESULTS: In total, 18 RCTs were included in the current review. There was variability across reported indicators of disease severity, definition of treatment resistance, as well as treatment protocols, preventing clear direct and indirect comparison of relative efficacy of ketamine at different stages of treatment resistance. Ketamine was effective in reducing depressive symptoms in RCTs at both lower and higher stages of treatment resistance; however, the effect size and duration of effects was greater in RCTs of lower stage of treatment resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that ketamine has antidepressant efficacy across all identified stages of treatment resistance, however with increasing failed treatment trials, treatment might be less efficacious. At this time, the comparative efficacy as a function of resistance stage remains to be well-established.

(R,S)-Ketamine was initially developed as an anesthetic agent and its pharmacological properties were determined on the basis of this clinical use. However, pharmacological studies in rat led to the development of the 'Ketamine Paradigm', whereby (R,S)-ketamine and its N-demethylated metabolite (R,S)-norketamine were deemed the active compounds whereas the other ketamine metabolites were considered inactive. Recent in vivo and in vitro studies with (2S,6S)-hydroxynorketamine, a previously identified 'inactive' metabolite, have demonstrated that this compound is an active and selective inhibitor of the α7 subtype of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and that this activity contributes to the pharmacological responses associated with the antidepressant activity of (R,S)-ketamine. Thus, it appears that it is necessary to reassess the 'Ketamine Paradigm' in regards to the use of sub-anesthetic doses of (R,S)-ketamine in the treatment of treatment-resistant depression.",0,"[0.9916406869888306, 0.00835927203297615]",0
5169,"The disruptive effects of methamphetamine on delayed-matching-to-sample performance reflect proactive interference and are reduced by SCH23390.^
Different drugs produce different patterns of impairment on delayed matching-to-sample tasks. For example, (+/-)3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) produces an increase in proactive interference. That is, subjects are less accurate when they are required to make a response different to the one they made on the immediately previous trial. The current study assessed whether methamphetamine also produces this particular pattern of disruption in delayed matching-to-sample performance in rats. Methamphetamine primarily reduced accuracy on trials where the correct response differed from the one made on the previous trial. Thus methamphetamine, like MDMA and other stimulant-based drugs of abuse, increased proactive interference. This impairment was reduced by prior administration of the dopamine D1 antagonist SCH23390. These results further extend a general conclusion that a range of stimulant-based drugs may disrupt working memory function indirectly via a tendency to repeat previously made responses and that this disruption is related to D1 receptor activity.

5612,"Lifetime history of heroin use is associated with greater drug severity among prescription opioid abusers.^
BACKGROUND: While research suggests primary prescription opioid (PO) abusers may exhibit less severe demographic and drug use characteristics than primary heroin abusers, less is known about whether a lifetime history of heroin use confers greater severity among PO abusers. OBJECTIVE: In this secondary analysis, we examined demographic and drug use characteristics as a function of lifetime heroin use among 89 PO-dependent adults screened for a trial evaluating the relative efficacy of buprenorphine taper durations. Exploratory analyses also examined contribution of lifetime heroin use to treatment response among a subset of participants who received a uniform set of study procedures. METHODS: Baseline characteristics were compared between participants reporting lifetime heroin use ≥5 (H(+); n=41) vs. <5 (H(-); n=48) times. Treatment response (i.e., illicit opioid abstinence and treatment retention at end of study) was examined in the subset of H(+) and H(-) participants randomized to receive the 4-week taper condition (N=22). RESULTS: H(+) participants were significantly older and more likely to be male. They reported longer durations of illicit opioid use, greater alcohol-related problems, more past-month cocaine use, greater lifetime IV drug use, and greater lifetime use of cigarettes, amphetamines and hallucinogens. H(+) participants also had lower scores on the Positive Symptom Distress and Depression subscales of the Brief Symptom Inventory. Finally, there was a trend toward poorer treatment outcomes among H(+) participants.

3492,"Nature-themed video intervention may improve cardiovascular safety of psilocybin-assisted therapy for alcohol use disorder.^
INTRODUCTION: Psychedelic-assisted therapy with psilocybin has shown promise in Phase 2 trials for alcohol use disorder (AUD). Set and setting, particularly factors facilitating a connection with nature, may positively influence the psychedelic experience and therapeutic outcomes. But to date, randomized controlled trials of interventions to enhance set and setting for psychedelic-assisted therapy are lacking. METHODS: This was a pilot randomized, controlled trial of Visual Healing, a nature-themed video intervention to optimize set and setting, versus Standard set and setting procedures with two open-label psilocybin 25 mg dosing sessions among 20 participants with AUD. For the first session, participants randomized to Visual Healing viewed nature-themed videos during the preparation session and the ""ascent"" and ""descent"" phases of the psilocybin dosing session while participants randomized to the Standard condition completed a meditation during the preparatory session and wore eyeshades and listened to a music playlist throughout the dosing session. For the second session 4 weeks later, participants chose either Visual Healing or Standard procedures. Primary outcomes were feasibility, safety, and tolerability of Visual Healing. Secondary and exploratory outcomes were changes in alcohol use, psychedelic effects, anxiety and stress. RESULTS: Nineteen of 20 (95%) randomized participants (mean age 49 ± 11 years, 60% female) completed the 14-week study. During the first psilocybin session, participants viewed an average of 37.9 min of the 42-min video and there were no video-related adverse events. Peak increase in post-psilocybin blood pressure was significantly less for participants randomly assigned to Visual Healing compared to Standard procedures. Alcohol use decreased significantly in both Visual Healing and Standard groups and psychedelic effects, stress, and anxiety were similar between groups. DISCUSSION: In this open-label pilot study, viewing Visual Healing videos during preparation and psilocybin dosing sessions was feasible, safe, and well-tolerated among participants with AUD. Preliminary findings suggest that Visual Healing has potential to reduce the cardiovascular risks of psychedelic therapy, without interfering with the psychedelic experience or alcohol-related treatment outcomes. Studies to replicate our findings as well as studies of different set and setting interventions with other psychedelic medications and indications are warranted.",1,"[0.006719659548252821, 0.9932803511619568]",1
991,"Long-term use of psychedelic drugs is associated with differences in brain structure and personality in humans.^
Psychedelic agents have a long history of use by humans for their capacity to induce profound modifications in perception, emotion and cognitive processes. Despite increasing knowledge of the neural mechanisms involved in the acute effects of these drugs, the impact of sustained psychedelic use on the human brain remains largely unknown. Molecular pharmacology studies have shown that psychedelic 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT)2A agonists stimulate neurotrophic and transcription factors associated with synaptic plasticity. These data suggest that psychedelics could potentially induce structural changes in brain tissue. Here we looked for differences in cortical thickness (CT) in regular users of psychedelics. We obtained magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images of the brains of 22 regular users of ayahuasca (a preparation whose active principle is the psychedelic 5HT2A agonist N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT)) and 22 controls matched for age, sex, years of education, verbal IQ and fluid IQ. Ayahuasca users showed significant CT differences in midline structures of the brain, with thinning in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), a key node of the default mode network. CT values in the PCC were inversely correlated with the intensity and duration of prior use of ayahuasca and with scores on self-transcendence, a personality trait measuring religiousness, transpersonal feelings and spirituality. Although direct causation cannot be established, these data suggest that regular use of psychedelic drugs could potentially lead to structural changes in brain areas supporting attentional processes, self-referential thought, and internal mentation. These changes could underlie the previously reported personality changes in long-term users and highlight the involvement of the PCC in the effects of psychedelics.",1,"[0.0032573379576206207, 0.9967426657676697]",1
2963,"[Acting out and psychoactive substances: alcohol, drugs, illicit substances].^
In humans, some psychotropic agents (alcohol, drugs, illicit substances) have been suggested to play a role in the occurrence of major behavioural disorders, mainly due to the suppression of psychomotor inhibition. Behavioural disinhibition is a physiological mechanism which allows humans to behave appropriately according to a given environmental situation. The behavioural disinhibition induced by either therapeutic dosage or misuse involves the loss of restraint over certain types of social behaviour and may increase the risk of auto or hetero-aggression and acting out. The increased use of psychotropic agents in recent years and the occurrence of unwanted effects are worrying and must be detected and evaluated. The objective of the present study was to establish a causal relationship between psychoactive substance use and occurrence of major behavioural disorders, such as paradoxical rage reactions and suicidal behaviour, based on a literature analysis. It consisted of reviewing reports of drug-induced violent reactions in healthy volunteers and demonstrating, where possible, a cause-effect relationship. Patients with schizophrenia and psychopathic personalities were not included in our study since psychiatric comorbidity could influence behavioural responses. Psychotropic agents included drugs, licit and illicit substances already associated with violence in the past. Many reports used the ""Go/No Go test"" to evaluate the disinhibiting effect of psychotropic substances; this allows the ""cognitive mapping"" of drugs. The results suggest that only alcohol, antidepressants, benzodiazepines and cocaïne are related to aggressive behaviour. The best known precipitant of behavioural disinhibition is alcohol, which induces aggressive behaviour. However, there are large differences between individuals, and attentional mechanisms are now recognised as being important in mediating the effects of alcohol. Suicidal tendency as an adverse antidepressant reaction is rare, especially with atypical antidepressants. However, the risk of acting out exists and the responsibility of antidepressant agents in the genesis of suicidal tendencies is now established. The disinhibiting effects of benzodiazepines are well-known and proven by clinical trials. It's a ""model"" of acting out, and the causal relationship is undeniable. That cocaïne is related to violent behaviour is demonstrated by its pharmacological actions on CNS. The chronic use of cocaïne induces ""a limbic dyscontrol syndrome"" based on the altered activity of limbic structures. On the contrary, we could not demonstrate a causal relationship between aggression and either cannabis, ecstasy or phencyclidine. Cannabis abusers look particularly for euphoria and relaxing effects. Aggression as an adverse cannabis reaction is very rare and occurs in most cases in association with other drugs and in predisposed individuals. Ecstasy use may lead to long-term alterations of neuronal function in the human CNS and cause psychiatric disorders. However, there is insufficient information about long-term use of ecstasy to estimate its role in the occurrence of behavioural disorders. Clinical and forensic assumptions about phencyclidine and violence were not warranted. However, the substance-effect relationships can be criticized in the case of alcohol, antidepressants, benzodiazepines and cocaïne. In fact, individual, social and psychiatric factors exert an influence on behaviour that is superior to the pharmacological effect of psychotropic agents. The most important parameter in drug-induced behavioural disinhibition is dosage, but mode of administration is also important. In addition, polysubstance abuse is very common. Substances may be taken simultaneously and alcohol is frequently combined with drugs. The combinations of substances result in multiple interactions, and very little is known about the effects of these interactions on violence in humans. Co-occurrence of substance abuse and other mental disorders is also very frequent. Multiple substance abuse should be avoided, because potential interactions between two or more drugs are more likely to cause violent behaviour. In the future, a specific treatment of these deleterious phenomena will have to be considered in order to reduce drug-induced iatrogenic behavioural disorders.",0,"[0.9872393012046814, 0.012760743498802185]",0
8803,"Combining ecstasy and ethanol: higher risk for toxicity? A review.^
Ecstasy use is commonly combined with ethanol consumption. While combination drug use in general is correlated with a higher risk for toxicity, the risk of the specific combination of ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)) and ethanol is largely unknown. Therefore, we have reviewed the literature on changes in MDMA pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics due to concurrent ethanol exposure in human, animal and in vitro studies. MDMA pharmacokinetics appear unaffected: the MDMA blood concentration after concurrent exposure to MDMA and ethanol was comparable to lone MDMA exposure in multiple human placebo-controlled studies. In contrast, MDMA pharmacodynamics were affected: locomotor activity increased and body temperature decreased after concurrent exposure to MDMA and ethanol compared to lone MDMA exposure. Importantly, these additional ethanol effects were consistently observed in multiple animal studies. Additional ethanol effects have also been reported on other pharmacodynamic aspects, but are inconclusive due to a low number of studies or due to inconsistent findings. These investigated pharmacodynamic aspects include monoamine brain concentrations, neurological (psychomotor function, memory, anxiety, reinforcing properties), cardiovascular, liver and endocrine effects. Although only a single or a few studies were available investigating these aspects, most studies indicated an aggravation of MDMA-induced effects upon concurrent ethanol exposure. In summary, concurrent ethanol exposure appears to increase the risk for MDMA toxicity. Increased toxicity is due to an aggravation of MDMA pharmacodynamics, while MDMA pharmacokinetics is largely unaffected. Although a significant attenuation of the MDMA-induced increase of body temperature was observed in animal studies, its relevance for human exposure remains unclear.",0,"[0.9939960241317749, 0.006004008464515209]",0

METHODS: Eight cocaine dependent individuals completed this double-blind, randomized, inpatient study. Three counter-balanced infusions separated by 48h were received: lorazepam (2mg) and two doses of ketamine (0.41mg/kg and 0.71mg/kg, with the former dose always preceding the latter). Infusions were followed within 15min by measures of dissociation (Clinician Administered Dissociative Symptoms Scale: CADSS) and mystical-type effects (adapted from Hood's Mysticism Scale: HMS). At baseline and 24h postinfusion, participants underwent assessments of motivation to stop cocaine (University of Rhode Island Change Assessment) and cue-induced craving (by visual analogue scale for cocaine craving during cue exposure). RESULTS: Ketamine led to significantly greater acute mystical-type effects (by HMS) relative to the active control lorazepam; ketamine 0.71mg/kg was associated with significantly higher HMS scores than was the 0.41mg/kg dose. HMS score, but not CADSS score, was found to mediate the effect of ketamine on motivation to quit cocaine 24h postinfusion. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that psychological mechanisms may be involved in some of the anti-addiction benefits resulting from ketamine. Future research can evaluate whether the psychoactive effects of ketamine influence improvements in larger samples.",1,"[0.0023430364672094584, 0.9976569414138794]",1
649,"Serotonergic deficits and impaired passive-avoidance learning in rats by MDEA:: A comparison with MDMA.^
The serotonergic deficits induced by 3,4-methylenedioxyethamphetamine (MDEA, ""eve""), were examined and com pared with 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""ecstasy""). A single dose of MDEA (10, 20, or 40 mg/kg IP) induced a dose-related hyperthermia, but only the highest dose significantly reduced 5-HT content and 5-HT transporter density in the frontal cortex and in the hippocampus 7 days later. Long-term serotonergic deficits were much more marked when MDEA was given repeatedly (40 mg/kg IP., b.i.d., for 4 consecutive days). Single or repeated administration of MDEA induced no change on 5-HT1A receptor density in the frontal cortex, brain stem, or hippocampus, although 3 h after both treatments plasma corticosterone levels were significantly increased. MDEA (5-20 mg/kg, IP) produced significant retention deficits in a passive-avoidance learning task. Conversely, 7 days after the repeated administration of MDEA (40 mg/kg b.i.d., for 4 consecutive days) no effect on passive-avoidance performance was observed unless rats were treated again with another dose of MDEA (20 mg/kg IP) 30 min before the training trial. The 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, WAY 100635, prevented the impairment in retention performance induced by 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), but not by MDEA or MDMA, indicating that the effect of these amphetamine derivates was not mediated by 5-HT1A receptor activation. The results suggest the risk of serotonergic dysfunction associated with MDEA abuse in humans. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.",0,"[0.9946531057357788, 0.0053469170816242695]",0
8146,"The death-implicit association test and suicide attempts: a systematic review and meta-analysis of discriminative and prospective utility.^
Suicide risk assessment involves integrating patient disclosure of suicidal ideation and non-specific risk factors such as family history, past suicidal behaviour, and psychiatric symptoms. A death version of the implicit association test (D-IAT) has been developed to provide an objective measure of the degree to which the self is affiliated with life or death. However, this has inconsistently been associated with past and future suicidal behaviour. Here, we systematically review and quantitatively synthesize the literature examining the D-IAT and suicide attempts. We searched psychINFO, Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from inception until 9 February 2021 to identify publications reporting D-IAT scores and suicide attempts (PROSPERO; CRD42020194394). Using random-effects models, we calculated standardized mean differences (SMD) and odds ratios (ORs) for retrospective suicide attempts. We then calculated ORs for future suicide attempts. ORs were dichotomized using a cutoff of zero representing equipoise between self-association with life and death. Eighteen studies met our inclusion criteria (n = 9551). The pooled SMD revealed higher D-IAT scores in individuals with a history of suicide attempt (SMD = 0.25, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.35); however, subgroup analyses demonstrated heterogeneity with acute care settings having lower effect sizes than community settings. Dichotomized D-IAT scores discriminated those with a history of suicide attempt from those without (OR 1.38 95% CI 1.01 to 1.89) and predicted suicide attempt over a six-month follow-up period (OR 2.99 95% CI 1.45 to 6.18; six studies, n = 781). The D-IAT may have a supplementary role in suicide risk assessment; however, determination of acute suicide risk and related clinical decisions should not be based solely on D-IAT performance.",0,"[0.9878525733947754, 0.012147445231676102]",0
1693,"Verbal Behavior Related to Drug Reinforcement in Polysubstance Cannabis Users: Comparison Across Drugs.^
Verbal reports of drug effects are often used in behavioral pharmacology. Two reports related to reinforcement are drug use (Harford, 1978; Liu et al., 2018) frequency and drug preference. Anecdotally, some individuals may specify a favorite/preferred drug (e.g., psilocybin) despite using another drug more frequently (e.g., tobacco). Research comparing these two measures has led to contradictory findings and included ratings from participants who may not have experience with the rated drugs. No comparisons have been made between use frequency and preference across multiple drugs in polysubstance users. To compare use frequency and preference for drug classes, and examine relations across drug classes, individuals reporting polysubstance use (N = 428) provided frequency and preference ratings for nine drug classes. Mean ratings showed smoked tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis were the most frequently used and most preferred drugs. Mean ratings showed 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and classic hallucinogens were the least frequently used and least preferred drugs. However, more divergence between use frequency and preference was observed when these metrics were examined among individuals. Correlation coefficients between use frequency and preference were lower than previously published literature. The majority of polydrug comparisons were nonsignificant, and correlations between different drug classes differed depending on whether use frequency or preference was examined. Verbal reports about use frequency are likely not strongly predictive of verbal reports about the same drug preference. Clinicians and researchers should recognize that different verbal reports related to drug reinforcement might be proxies for distinct aspects of reinforcement and should consider these implications for assessment and research findings",0,"[0.9914094805717468, 0.008590495213866234]",0
4227,"The Nitric Oxide (NO) Donor Molsidomine Counteract Social Withdrawal and Cognition Deficits Induced by Blockade of the NMDA Receptor in the Rat.^
The deficiency of the gaseous molecule nitric oxide (NO) seems to be critically involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Thus, molecules that can normalize NO levels, as are NO donors, might be of utility for the medication of this psychiatric disease. The aim of the present study was to detect the ability of the NO donor molsidomine to reduce schizophrenia-like impairments produced by the blockade of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor in rats. Molsidomine's ability to attenuate social withdrawal and spatial recognition memory deficits induced by the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine were assessed using the social interaction and the object location test, respectively. Further, the efficacy of the combination of sub-effective doses of molsidomine with sub-effective doses of the atypical antipsychotic clozapine in alleviating non-spatial recognition memory deficits was evaluated utilizing the object recognition task. Molsidomine (2 and 4 mg/kg) attenuated social withdrawal and spatial recognition memory deficits induced by ketamine. Co-administration of inactive doses of molsidomine (1 mg/kg) and clozapine (0.1 mg/kg) counteracted delay-dependent and ketamine-induced non-spatial recognition memory deficits. The current findings suggest that molsidomine is sensitive to glutamate hypofunction since it attenuated behavioral impairments in animal models mimicking the negative symptoms and cognitive deficits of schizophrenia. Additionally, the present results support the potential of molsidomine as an adjunctive drug for the therapy of schizophrenia.",0,"[0.9938750863075256, 0.006124946288764477]",0
248,"DMT alters cortical travelling waves.^
Psychedelic drugs are potent modulators of conscious states and therefore powerful tools for investigating their neurobiology. N,N, Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) can rapidly induce an extremely immersive state of consciousness characterized by vivid and elaborate visual imagery. Here, we investigated the electrophysiological correlates of the DMT-induced altered state from a pool of participants receiving DMT and (separately) placebo (saline) while instructed to keep their eyes closed. Consistent with our hypotheses, results revealed a spatio-temporal pattern of cortical activation (i.e. travelling waves) similar to that elicited by visual stimulation. Moreover, the typical top-down alpha-band rhythms of closed-eyes rest were significantly decreased, while the bottom-up forward wave was significantly increased. These results support a recent model proposing that psychedelics reduce the 'precision-weighting of priors', thus altering the balance of top-down versus bottom-up information passing. The robust hypothesis-confirming nature of these findings imply the discovery of an important mechanistic principle underpinning psychedelic-induced altered states.",1,"[0.0035981691908091307, 0.9964017868041992]",1
5023,"Early symptomatic improvements as a predictor of response to repeated-dose intravenous ketamine: Results from the Canadian Rapid Treatment Center of Excellence.^
BACKGROUND: Early symptomatic improvement with monoamine-based antidepressants is predictive of treatment response. The objective of this study was to determine if early symptomatic improvements with intravenous (IV) ketamine predicted treatment response to an acute course of four infusions. METHOD: 134 adults with treatment resistant depression (TRD) received four ketamine infusions over one to two weeks. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Quick Inventory for Depressive Symptomatology Self-Report(16) (QIDS-SR(16)) at baseline and post-infusions 1, 2, 3, and 4. Early improvement was defined as ≥20% reduction in QIDS-SR(16) scores after the first or second infusion. Linear models were used to determine whether early improvement was associated with post-infusion 4 QIDS-SR(16) scores after controlling for baseline characteristics. RESULTS: Early improvement post-infusion 1 (β = -3.52, 95% BCa CI [-5.40, -1.78]) and 2 (β = -3.16, 95% BCa CI [-5.75, -1.59]) both significantly predicted QIDS-SR(16) scores post-infusion 4. Early improvers had significantly lower QIDS-SR(16) scores at post-infusion 4 (post-infusion 1 improvers: M = 9.8, SD = 4.5; post-infusion 2 improvers: M = 10.6, SD = 5.7) compared to non-early improvers (post-infusion 1 non-improvers: M = 13.7, SD = 5.8; post-infusion 2 non-improvers: M = 14.1, SD = 5.3) when controlling for baseline characteristics. The majority (58%) of individuals who did not improve post-infusions 1 or 2 still experienced an antidepressant response or partial response (≥20% reduction in QIDS-SR(16)) post-infusion 4. LIMITATIONS: This is a post-hoc analysis of an open-label study. CONCLUSION: Early improvement was associated with greater antidepressant effects following a course of four ketamine infusions. However, individuals who did not show early improvements still had a high likelihood of experiencing clinically significant symptom reduction after the fourth infusion, suggesting that completing four infusions, regardless of early symptom changes, is appropriate and merited.",1,"[0.002961347345262766, 0.997038722038269]",1
6364,"Personal and family history of alcohol dependence alters antidepresant response to oral riluzole post-ketamine infusion.^
Background: Family history of alcohol dependence is a positive predictor of ketamine's antidepressant effects in unipolar and bipolar depression. As we recently suggested that the glutamatergic modulator riluzole may delay time to relapse after ketamine infusion in a 4 week trial, we investigated if a lifetime personal or family history of alcohol dependence mediated riluzole's effect. Methods: Secondary analysis of randomized, double‐blind placebo controlled trial of treatment‐resistant unipolar depression (18‐65, MADRS≥22) who received a single intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) and randomized to double‐blind treatment with riluzole (100‐200 mg/day) or placebo for 4 weeks. Results: Family history of alcohol dependence predicted a positive response to ketamine (p=.02). In subjects randomized to placebo, the family history positive group maintained a greater antidepressant response (p=.002). There was no significant difference in antidepressant efficacy based on a family history of alcoholism in subjects randomized to riluzole (p=.88). No antidepressant difference was observed between placebo and riluzole in subjects with no family history of alcoholism (p=.27). Riluzole inhibited the sustained antidepressant effect in subjects with a family history of alcoholism (p=.04). Past personal history had no main effect (p=.057). Conclusions: Riluzole reduced the antidepressant effect of ketamine in patients with a family history but does not significantly improve the effect in patients without a family history. Personal history did not emerge as a significant factor. Although this study was not specifically powered based on family history, it is unlikely that riluzole extension post‐ketamine is a useful adjunct based on personal or family history of alcoholism.",1,"[0.0028057603631168604, 0.9971941709518433]",1
1569,"Ketamine and electroconvulsive therapy: so happy together?.^
PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Anesthetics, such as thiopental, methohexital, propofol and ketamine have been used to induce unconsciousness for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), each with its advantages and disadvantages. Only until recently was it discovered that ketamine may have inherent antidepressant effects. We reviewed the side effect profile of ketamine and examined the literature for whether or not ketamine augments the antidepressant effects of ECT. RECENT FINDINGS: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials of the potential benefits of adding ketamine to ECT treatment have generated varied conclusions. Currently there is a lack of clear evidence that ketamine with ECT is more efficacious than ECT alone. SUMMARY: Large, multicenter randomized controlled trials are needed to further investigate the potential advantages of adding ketamine to ECT for patients with severe or refractory depression. The addition of ketamine to ECT treatment may have some early beneficial effect in patients with acute depressive disorders. Most likely, ECT itself is responsible for lasting remission from severe depression. Ketamine's side effect profile may be undesirable in certain patient populations, and so the risks and benefits of the addition of this drug to ECT treatment must be weighed.",0,"[0.9939969778060913, 0.006002952344715595]",0
664,"Effects of intra-operative sedation with low-doses of s-ketamine on depression: randomized double-blind controlled trial.^
Introduction: The available antidepressants block neuronal reuptake of catecholamines, serotonin or both. They take weeks to produce full clinical effects, which suggest that the NMDA system may be involved in the pathophysiology of depression [1]. Ketamine, a non competitive antagonist acting at NMDA receptors, is reported to have a rapid onset of anti‐depressive effects [2,3,4]. Objective: To investigate the effect of intra‐operative sedation of S‐ketamine on indices of depression. Method: 80 patients aged 60 to 83 years of age, selected for surgery under epidural anesthesia, were classified as depressed (D) or non‐depressed (ND), according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐IV) criteria, and randomized into two sub‐groups D1, D2 and ND1, ND2. The sub‐groups D1 and ND1 received S‐ketamine and midazolam, while the groups D2 and ND2, received only midazolam. Sedation was titrated to achieve grade 3‐4 of the Ramsay Sedation Scale. Depression was assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating (HDR) Scale of 21 items, applied preoperatively and postoperatively. Results: The mean HDR score decreased from the preoperative value of 18.8 Â ±6,3 to 12.7 Â ±4.5 on the second postoperative day in depressed patients who received S‐ketamine+midazolam (P Ë “ 0,0001). There were no significant differences between the non depressed groups. Discussion: Racemic ketamine have clinical effects similar to the classic antidepressants, but with a quicker onset and a lasting effect [2,3,4]. We demonstrated that S‐ketamine can improve depressed patients the same way. The modest doses of S‐ketamine and the epidural anesthesia may have accounted for the absence of hypertension in all groups. No arrhythmiaswere found. The use of midazolam lowered the incidence of psychotomimetic effects [5], decreased the cardiovascular stimulating effects of ketamine on the systemic and pulmonary circulation [6,7] and allowed intra‐operative sedation. Patients who suffer from depression appear to appreciate pain with greater acuity [8]. Actually, depressed patients felt more pain in the postoperative period than the nondepressed ones. Postoperative analgesic effects of S‐ketamine are still under discussion [9,10], but they could potentially have improved depression. However depressed patients (D1) had a significant amelioration in the severity of their depression despite no significant differences in pain scores, from D2 group. Therefore we exclude the putative analgesic effects of S‐ketamine as a cause for the improved postoperative depressed state of these patients. Conclusions: Intra‐operative sedation with low doses of S‐ketamine has a beneficial effect on depressed patients.",1,"[0.009289425797760487, 0.9907105565071106]",1
1346,"The effects of using answer sheets on reported drug use and data quality in a classroom survey: A cluster-randomized study.^
BACKGROUND: We compare self-reported prevalence of drug use and indicators of data quality from two different response modes (with and without an independent answer sheet for recording responses) in a survey conducted in 2015 among secondary school students. METHODS: Stratified cluster-randomized study conducted among students in grades 8-12 from public, private and subsidized schools in Chile (N=2317 students in 122 classes). Measurements included were: percentage reporting substance use (tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, ecstasy); number of inconsistent responses; number of item nonresponses; percentage of extreme reports of drug use; percentage reporting using the nonexistent drug, relevón; and completion times. RESULTS: Compared with those who responded directly in the questionnaire booklet, students who used a separate answer sheet took 17.6 more minutes (95% confidence interval [CI]: 14.4-20.8) to complete the survey and had on average 1.5 more inconsistent responses (95%CI: 0.91-2.14). The prevalence and variance of drug use was higher among those who used an answer sheet for all substances except tobacco; the prevalence ratio (PR) of reported substance use for low-prevalence substances during the past year were: cocaine PR=2.5 (95%CI: 1.6-4.1); ecstasy PR=5.0 (95%CI: 2.4-10.5); relevón PR=4.8 (95%CI: 2.5-9.3). CONCLUSIONS: Using an answer sheet for a self-administered paper-and-pencil survey of drug use among students result in lower quality data and higher reports of drug use. International comparison of adolescent drug use from school-based surveys should be done with caution. The relative ranking of a country could be misleading if different mode of recording answers are used.",0,"[0.9834438562393188, 0.016556087881326675]",0

There is an increasing interest in potential medical applications of ayahuasca, a South American psychotropic plant tea with a long cultural history of indigenous medical and religious use. Clinical research into ayahuasca will require specific, sensitive and comprehensive methods for the characterization and quantitation of these compounds and their metabolites in blood. A combination of two analytical techniques (high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet and/or fluorescence detection and gas chromatography with nitrogen-phosphorus detection) has been used for the analysis of some of the constituents of ayahuasca in blood following its oral consumption. We report here a single methodology for the direct analysis of 14 of the major alkaloid components of ayahuasca, including several known and potential metabolites of N,N-dimethyltryptamine and the harmala alkaloids in blood.

1646,"Perceptions of Contingency Management for Addiction Clinic Linkage Among Hospitalized Patients with Alcohol Use Disorder: initial Findings of a Randomized Controlled Trial.^
Background: Post‐discharge follow‐up is rare among patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD), estimated at 12% at our institution (pre‐pandemic). Contingency management (CM) – providing a concrete/financial incentive to elicit a behavioral outcome– may increase alcohol abstinence (Koffarnus, Bickel, and Kablinger 2018; McDonell et al. 2017). We explored the use of CM in promoting linkage among hospitalized patients with AUD. This will provide insight to determine whether CM is a viable tool for increasing follow‐up among patients admitted with AUD. Methods: This study occurs within a pilot trial (target n=45‐60) that randomizes patients to receive extended‐release naltrexone, intravenous ketamine, or neither prior to discharge. All participants receive enhanced linkage to care, including a payment of $10 at enrollment and $20 at an addiction clinic one week post‐discharge. We present data on participant perception of how financial motivation influenced their participation in the study. Quantitative data include responses to the question: “how much did the financial reward motivate you to…” “…join the study” (baseline) and “…come to clinic” (follow‐up) on a Likert scale (1‐10). IRB approval was obtained. Results: To date, thirteen participants have been enrolled; one dropped out pre‐intervention (n=12). Fifty percent (n=6) presented to the scheduled appointment, and 83.3% of them reported a higher financial‐motivator score than at baseline (mean increase 4 points). The two participants who scored a 10 (“extremely motivating”) at baseline did not present to follow‐up. Discussion: Our initial study population, despite a global pandemic, demonstrates a high follow‐up rate, and participants may not immediately recognize how motivating CM will be. This may be attributable to the enhanced linkage, which includes a small financial reward contingent on presentation. Follow‐up CM has also been demonstrated in Hepatis C treatment (Norton et al. 2019). Conclusion: Contingency management holds great potential for increasing treatment engagement in AUD, particularly during transitions from the hospital. This study demonstrates a significant increase in follow‐up from pre‐pandemic baseline (12%) to present (50%). References: 1.

This study evaluated hair samples from 28 subjects who tested positive for ketamine at Seoul Institute National Forensic Service in Korea between 2016 and 2017. Ketamine in the hair was extracted using a solution of 1% hydrochloric acid in methanol for 16 h. Extracts were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). The LC-MS-MS method was validated by determining the limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), linearity, intra- and inter-accuracy, precision and matrix effect. In 59 ketamine-positive hair or hair segments from 28 ketamine abusers, the ketamine concentration was found to be in the range of 0.011-335.8 ng/mg (mean, 13.6; median, 1.8), and the norketamine concentration was found to be in the range of 0.001-35.7 ng/mg (mean, 7.5; median, 0.44). The ratio of norketamine to ketamine concentrations in hair was in the range of 0.01-1.46 (mean, 0.34; median, 0.26). The distribution of ketamine concentration in hair samples was as follows: 0.01-0.1 ng/mg in 11 samples (18.6%), 0.1-5 ng/mg in 33 samples (55.9%), 5-10 ng/mg in 4 samples (6.8%), 10-15 ng/mg in 2 samples (3.4%), 15-20 ng/mg in 4 samples (6.8%), 40-45 ng/mg in 2 samples (3.4%), 45-50 ng/mg in 1 sample (1.7%) and >100 ng/mg in only 2 samples (3.4%).

700,"Memory-related hippocampal functioning in ecstasy and amphetamine users: a prospective fMRI study.^
RATIONALE: Recreational use of ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine [MDMA]) has been associated with memory impairments. Functional neuroimaging studies with cross-sectional designs reported altered memory-related hippocampal functioning in ecstasy-polydrug users. However, differences might be pre-existing or related to the concomitant use of amphetamine. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively investigate the specific effects of ecstasy on memory-related hippocampal functioning. METHODS: We used an associative memory task and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 40 ecstasy and/or amphetamine users at baseline (t1) and after 12 months (t2). At t1, all subjects had very limited amphetamine and/or ecstasy experience (less than 5 units lifetime dose). Based on the reported drug use at t2, subjects with continued ecstasy and/or amphetamine use (n = 17) were compared to subjects who stopped use after t1 (n = 12). RESULTS: Analysis of repeated measures revealed that encoding-related activity in the left parahippocampal gyrus changed differentially between the groups. Activity in this region increased in abstinent subjects from t1 to t2, however, decreased in subjects with continued use. Decreases within the left parahippocampal gyrus were associated with the use of ecstasy, but not amphetamine, during the follow-up period. However, there were no significant differences in memory performance. CONCLUSIONS: The current findings suggest specific effects of ecstasy use on memory-related hippocampal functioning. However, alternative explanations such as (sub-)acute cannabis effects are conceivable.",1,"[0.002689577406272292, 0.9973104000091553]",1
2980,"Serotonergic psychedelic drugs LSD and psilocybin reduce the hierarchical differentiation of unimodal and transmodal cortex.^
Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin are serotonergic psychedelic compounds with potential in the treatment of mental health disorders. Past neuroimaging investigations have revealed that both compounds can elicit significant changes to whole-brain functional organization and dynamics. A recent proposal linked past findings into a unified model and hypothesized reduced whole-brain hierarchical organization as a key mechanism underlying the psychedelic state, but this has yet to be directly tested. We applied a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique previously used to map hierarchical connectivity gradients to assess cortical organization in the LSD and psilocybin state from two previously published pharmacological resting-state fMRI datasets (N = 15 and 9, respectively). Results supported our primary hypothesis: The principal gradient of cortical connectivity, describing a hierarchy from unimodal to transmodal cortex, was significantly flattened under both drugs relative to their respective placebo conditions. Between-condition contrasts revealed that this was driven by a reduction of functional differentiation at both hierarchical extremes - default and frontoparietal networks at the upper end, and somatomotor at the lower. Gradient-based connectivity mapping indicated that this was underpinned by a disruption of modular unimodal connectivity and increased unimodal-transmodal crosstalk. Results involving the second and third gradient, which, respectively represent axes of sensory and executive differentiation, also showed significant alterations across both drugs. These findings provide support for a recent mechanistic model of the psychedelic state relevant to therapeutic applications of psychedelics. More fundamentally, we provide the first evidence that macroscale connectivity gradients are sensitive to an acute pharmacological manipulation, supporting a role for psychedelics as scientific tools to perturb cortical functional organization.",1,"[0.003140424145385623, 0.9968595504760742]",0
3244,"Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy for People with Eating Disorders.^
PURPOSE OF REVIEW: A growing body of research suggests psychedelic-assisted therapy (PAT) may be safe and effective for a variety of mental health conditions. Among these, eating disorders have been a recent target of interest. This review provides an up-to-date summary of the potential mechanisms and use of PAT in people diagnosed with eating disorders, with a focus on anorexia nervosa. RECENT FINDINGS: Classic psychedelics may have transdiagnostic efficacy through several mechanisms relevant to eating disorder pathology. Interest in, and efforts to increase access to PAT are both high.

6000,"A Test of MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy in People With Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.^
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) occurs in response to a traumatic event or events. It is most likely to occur following an event involving perceived personal threat, such as rape or physical assault. PTSD is clearly a public health problem that causes a great deal of suffering and accounts for a significant portion of health care costs. This study will examine whether two sessions of methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)‐assisted psychotherapy can be safely administered to participants with PTSD, and whether MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy, when compared with placebo‐assisted therapy, will reduce PTSD symptoms after each session and two months after the second session. MDMA is a substance possessing unique effects that make it well suited to intensive psychotherapy. MDMA has been hypothesized to represent a new class of drugs, called entactogens, that produce feelings of closeness to others, empathy, well being, and insightfulness. Currently, MDMA is scheduled (illegal) and cannot be used outside of research studies like this one. Anecdotal reports of therapy conducted before MDMA was made illegal suggest that MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy may benefit people with PTSD. This study will examine MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy in twenty people ages 18 to 70 with PTSD either related to crime victimization or combat, when combat‐related PTSD lasts no longer than five years, and that has not gotten better after psychotherapy and treatment with an SSRI (selective serotonin uptake inhibitor, such as Paxil). This study lasts three to four months. Participants attend up to fourteen (14) ordinary (non‐drug) psychotherapy sessions with the investigators as well as two eight hour long experimental (MDMA or placebo) sessions and one MDMA session. People taking part in this study cannot take any psychiatric medication during the study period. People will either get 125 mg MDMA or placebo ""by chance,"" as by coin‐toss, with twelve of twenty (60%) getting MDMA during each experimental session, and eight of twenty (40%) getting placebo. Two to two and a half hours later, if you and the investigators agree it is alright, you will take a second supplemental, dose of MDMA or placebo. The supplemental dose will be half the size of the first dose. The same investigators conducting non‐drug therapy sessions conduct the experimental sessions. All participants are required to stay the night at the clinic after each experimental session. Participants meet with the investigators for a non‐drug assisted therapy session the day after each experimental session. A third MDMA session in this placebo‐controlled stage of the study will only be for people who received MDMA in the first two sessions. PTSD symptoms are measured at the start of the study, four days after each experimental session, and finally two months after the second experimental session. People are tested on memory and problem solving when they first enter the study and again two months after the second experimental session. PTSD symptoms are measured to see whether there are any changes in symptoms during the study, and tests of thinking, memory and problem‐solving are meant to spot any changes that could be due to MDMA or MDMA‐assisted therapy. Participants who recieved MDMA who complete the final evaluation, and upon discussion with the investigators, will undergo a third MDMA session. The third session will happen approximately two months after the second experimental session This session is ""open label,"" meaning that they and the investigators will both know they are receiving MDMA. It will be followed by one psychotherapy session a day after this session and two additional psychotherapy sessions in the following weeks. PTSD symptoms will be measured again two months after the third MDMA session. Participants who received placebo and complete the final evaluation two months after the second experimental procedure will be given an opportunity to take part in an open‐label continuation of the study where they will receive an initial dose of 125 mg MDMA and a supplemental dose of 62.5 mg MDMA in up to three experimental sessions scheduled three to five weeks apart. Participants in this open‐label continuation will act as their own controls. The open‐label continuation lasts three months and will involve nine more visits with the investigators, including the two experimental sessions.",1,"[0.00338893779553473, 0.9966110587120056]",1
5039,"An Intraoperative Sub-Anesthetic Dose of Esketamine on Postoperative Depressive Symptoms in Perimenopausal Women with Breast Cancer Undergoing Modified Radical Mastectomy: Protocol for a Randomized, Triple-Blinded, Controlled Trial.^
BACKGROUND: Depressive symptoms are common among perimenopausal women with breast cancer having modified radical mastectomy. Esketamine exerts antidepressant effects. This study aims to assess whether an intraoperative sub-anesthetic dose of esketamine prevents postoperative depressive symptoms in these patients. METHODS: In this randomized, triple-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, we will enroll 130 perimenopausal women (aged 45-60 years) with breast cancer undergoing unilateral modified radical mastectomy. Patients will be randomly assigned with a 1:1 ratio to receive either esketamine (0.25 mg/kg i.v.) or normal saline after anesthesia induction and before skin incision. The primary outcome is the incidence of depressive symptoms at day 30 postoperatively, assessed using the Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI). Secondary outcomes include incidence of depressive symptoms and BDI scores at day 1, 3, and 180 postoperatively, anxiety symptoms and scores at day 1, 3, 30, and 180 postoperatively, pain intensity and quality of recovery at day 1 and 2 postoperatively, nausea and vomiting within 48 hours postoperatively, length of postoperative hospital stay, and cancer-specific outcomes. Data will be analyzed in the modified intention-to-treat population. DISCUSSION: This is the first trial to evaluate the effects of a sub-anesthetic dose of esketamine on depressive symptoms in perimenopausal women after modified radical mastectomy. The results of this study will help to improve their mental health and recovery after breast cancer surgery.

Impairments in auditory information processing in schizophrenia as indexed electrophysiologically by P300 deficits during novelty (P3a) and target (P3b) processing are linked to N -methyl- D -aspartate receptor (NMDAR) dysfunction. This study in 14 healthy volunteers examined the effects of a subanesthetic dose of the NMDAR antagonist ketamine on P300 and their relationship to psychomimetic symptoms and cortical source activity (with eLORETA). Ketamine reduced early (e- P3a) and late (l-P3a) novelty P300 at sensor (scalp)-level and at source-level in the salience network. Increases in dissociation symptoms were negatively correlated with ketamine-induced P3b changes, at sensor-level and source-level, in both salience and central executive networks. These P3a alterations during novelty processing, and the symptom-related P3b changes during target processing support a model of NMDAR hypofunction underlying disrupted auditory attention in schizophrenia.",1,"[0.0029671872034668922, 0.9970327615737915]",1
2051,"Opposite alterations of 5­HT2A receptor brain density in subjects with schizophrenia: relevance of radiotracers pharmacological profile.^
The status of serotonin 5­HT2A receptors (5­HT2ARs) in schizophrenia has been controversial. In vivo positron emission tomography neuroimaging and in vitro post-mortem binding studies have reported conflicting results about 5­HT2AR density. Radiotracers bind different receptor conformations depending on their agonist, antagonist or inverse agonist properties. This study investigates 5­HT2AR density in the post-mortem prefrontal cortex from subjects with schizophrenia and controls using three radiotracers with a different pharmacological profile. The specific binding parameters of the inverse agonist [18F]altanserin, the agonist [3H]lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and the antagonist [3H]MDL100907 to brain cortex membranes from 20 subjects with schizophrenia and 20 individually matched controls were evaluated under similar methodological conditions. Ten schizophrenia subjects were antipsychotic-free at death. Saturation curve analyses were performed by non-linear regression to obtain a maximal density of binding sites (Bmax) and the affinity of the respective radiotracers (Kd). In schizophrenia subjects, 5-HT2AR density was decreased when quantified by [18F]altanserin binding, whereas increased when evaluated by [3H]LSD binding. However, [3H]MDL100907 binding was unaltered. A slight loss of affinity (higher Kd) was observed exclusively in [3H]LSD binding. The findings were more evident in antipsychotic-free subjects than in antipsychotic-treated subjects. In conclusion, a higher proportion of the 5-HT2AR-active functional conformation, which is rather identified by agonist radiotracers, was observed in schizophrenia patients. A consequent reduction of the inactive 5-HT2AR conformation, which is preferentially identified by inverse agonist radiotracers, was also obtained. Antagonist radiotracers do not distinguish between molecular conformations of the receptor, and accordingly, the absence of changes was shown. These results are compatible with the proposed increased functional activity of brain cortical 5-HT2ARs in schizophrenia.",0,"[0.99114990234375, 0.008850165642797947]",0
7361,"ERP evidence suggests executive dysfunction in ecstasy polydrug users.^
Background: Deficits in executive functions such as access to semantic/long-term memory have been shown in ecstasy users in previous research. Equally, there have been many reports of equivocal findings in this area. The current study sought to further investigate behavioural and electro- physiological measures of this executive function in ecstasy users. Method: Twenty ecstasy-polydrug users, 20 non-ecstasy-polydrug users and 20 drug-naïve controls were recruited. Participants completed background questionnaires about their drug use, sleep quality, fluid intelligence and mood state. Each individual also completed a semantic retrieval task whilst 64 channel Electroencephalography (EEG) measures were recorded. Results: Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) revealed no between-group differences in behavioural performance on the task. Mixed ANOVA on event-related potential (ERP) components P2, N2 and P3 revealed significant between-group differences in the N2 component. Subsequent exploratory univariate ANOVAs on the N2 component revealed marginally significant between-group differences, generally showing greater negativity at occipito-parietal electrodes in ecstasy users compared to drug-naïve controls. Despite absence of behavioural differences, differences in N2 magnitude are evidence of abnormal executive functioning in ecstasy-polydrug users. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",1,"[0.002776982029899955, 0.9972230195999146]",1

The methods developed were reproducible (RSD=5.0-16.1%), accurate (85.1-100.6%) and sensitive (LD=0.05-0.30 ng/mg). They were applied in the analysis of 221 hair samples obtained from young subjects aged 15-25 years, who were suspected of drug abuse. Seventy-seven hair samples were found positive for drugs of abuse. Forty-two subjects were found to have consumed amphetamine, of whom 40 were found MDMA (Ecstasy). Heroin consumption, based on positive 6-acetylmorphine, was found in 26 subjects. Cocaine alone was present in three subjects, two were found cocaine and heroin, two cocaine and methadone, and one cocaine and MDMA. These results could indicate the trend in drug abuse among young people in Croatia.",0,"[0.9826065301895142, 0.01739354431629181]",0
219,"Gender discrimination and illicit drug use among African American and European American adolescents and emerging adults.^
Objective: The present study aimed to characterize the association of perceived gender discrimination and illicit drug use among a sample of African American (AA) and European American (EA) adolescent girls and young women. Method: Data were drawn from a high-risk family study of alcohol use disorder of mothers and their offspring (N = 735). Multinomial regressions were used to examine whether experience of offspring and maternal gender discrimination were associated with offspring illicit drug use (cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy, PCP, opiates, hallucinogens, solvents, sedatives, or inhalants). Outcomes included offspring age of drug use initiation (age ≤ 14) and lifetime heavy drug use (≥ 50 times) of 1 or more illicit substances. Interactions between race and offspring gender discrimination were modeled to assess for race differences. Results: Results revealed that gender discrimination was associated with a greater likelihood of offspring early initiation (relative risk ratio [RRR] = 2.57, 95% CI [1.31, 5.03]) versus later initiation (RRR = 1.33, 95% CI [0.80, 2.24]). Offspring gender discrimination was associated with offspring heavy drug use (RRR = 2.09, 95% CI [1.07, 4.06]) and not associated with moderate/light use (RRR = 1.44, 95% CI [0.86, 2.42]), but post hoc tests revealed no significant group differences. Conclusions: Findings suggest that perceived offspring gender discrimination is associated with early drug use initiation. Gender discrimination, particularly at an early age, has a potential to cause harm, including drug use. Implementation of policies that foster environments that eliminate gender bias and discrimination at an early age should be prioritized. Gender-responsive treatment merits consideration by substance use treatment providers. Public Significance Statement: This study indicates that adolescent females who experience gender discrimination, are more likely to initiate drugs at an earlier age. Targeting gender discrimination during adolescence may be important, before gender norms become rooted into one’s trajectory.

Barratt, J. A. Ferris and A. R. Winstock (Journal of Psychopharmacology, 2022[Jan], Vol 36[1], 85-96). The authors would like to alert readers to a Conflict of Interest that was omitted when this article was originally published. The full Conflict of Interest is given in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2022-28673-010[/rid]). Background: Microdosing psychedelics is the practice of taking small, sub-hallucinogenic doses of lysergic acid diethylamide or psilocybin-containing mushrooms. Despite its surging popularity, little is known about the specific intentions to start microdosing and the effects of this practice. Aims: First, we aimed to replicate previous findings regarding the subjective benefits and challenges reported for microdosing. Second, we assessed whether people who microdose test their substances before consumption. Third, we examined whether having an approach-intention to microdosing was predictive of more reported benefits. Methods: The Global Drug Survey runs the world’s largest online drug survey. Participants who reported last year use of lysergic acid diethylamide or psilocybin in the Global Drug Survey 2019 were offered the opportunity to answer a sub-section on microdosing. Results: Data from 6753 people who reported microdosing at least once in the last 12 months were used for analyses. Our results suggest a partial replication of previously reported benefits and challenges among the present sample often reporting enhanced mood, creativity, focus and sociability. Counter to our prediction, the most common challenge participants associated with microdosing was ‘None’. As predicted, most participants reported not testing their substances. Counter to our hypothesis, approach-intention—microdosing to approach a desired goal—predicted less rather than more benefits. We discuss alternate frameworks that may better capture the reasons people microdose. Conclusion: Our results suggest the perceived benefits associated with microdosing greatly outweigh the challenges. Microdosing may have utility for a variety of uses while having minimal side effects. Double-blind, placebo-controlled experiments are required to substantiate these reports.

Ecstasy is the second most widely abused illegal drug in Europe. Ecstasy is the colloquial name for 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), but not all Ecstasy tablets contain MDMA. When taken in hot, crowded environments, Ecstasy/MDMA users have developed acute complications that have had fatal consequences. Epidemiological evidence indicates that adverse reactions to Ecstasy/MDMA intoxication are rare and idiosyncratic. Potential mechanisms of action are reviewed. In animal studies, MDMA damages serotonergic fibres and reduces the number of serotonin transporter sites within the CNS. Demonstration of neurotoxicity in human users of Ecstasy is hampered by a number of confounds that the majority of published studies have failed to address.

3787,"Effects of a beta-blocker on the cardiovascular response to MDMA (Ecstasy).^
BACKGROUND: MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, 'Ecstasy') produces tachycardia and hypertension and is rarely associated with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications. In clinical practice, beta-blockers are often withheld in patients with stimulant intoxication because they may increase hypertension and coronary artery vasospasm due to loss of beta(2)-mediated vasodilation and unopposed alpha-receptor activation. However, it is unknown whether beta-blockers affect the cardiovascular response to MDMA. METHODS: The effects of the non-selective beta-blocker pindolol (20 mg) on the cardiovascular effects of MDMA (1.6 mg/kg) were investigated in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study in 16 healthy subjects. RESULTS: Pindolol prevented MDMA-induced increases in heart rate. Peak values (mean+/-SD) for heart rate were 84+/-13 beats/min after MDMA vs 69+/-7 beats/min after pindolol-MDMA. In contrast, pindolol pretreatment had no effect on increases in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) after MDMA. Peak MAP values were 115+/-11 mm Hg after MDMA vs 114+/-11 mm Hg after pindolol-MDMA. Pindolol did not change adverse effects of MDMA. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that beta-blockers may prevent increases in heart rate but not hypertensive and adverse effects of MDMA.",1,"[0.0026689565274864435, 0.9973310232162476]",1
8525,"Psilocin acutely alters sleep-wake architecture and cortical brain activity in laboratory mice.^
Serotonergic psychedelic drugs, such as psilocin (4-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine), profoundly alter the quality of consciousness through mechanisms which are incompletely understood. Growing evidence suggests that a single psychedelic experience can positively impact long-term psychological well-being, with relevance for the treatment of psychiatric disorders, including depression. A prominent factor associated with psychiatric disorders is disturbed sleep, and the sleep-wake cycle is implicated in the homeostatic regulation of neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity. However, it remains largely unknown to what extent psychedelic agents directly affect sleep, in terms of both acute arousal and homeostatic sleep regulation. Here, chronic electrophysiological recordings were obtained in mice to track sleep-wake architecture and cortical activity after psilocin injection. Administration of psilocin led to delayed REM sleep onset and reduced NREM sleep maintenance for up to approximately 3 h after dosing, and the acute EEG response was associated primarily with an enhanced oscillation around 4 Hz. No long-term changes in sleep-wake quantity were found. When combined with sleep deprivation, psilocin did not alter the dynamics of homeostatic sleep rebound during the subsequent recovery period, as reflected in both sleep amount and EEG slow-wave activity. However, psilocin decreased the recovery rate of sleep slow-wave activity following sleep deprivation in the local field potentials of electrodes targeting the medial prefrontal and surrounding cortex. It is concluded that psilocin affects both global vigilance state control and local sleep homeostasis, an effect which may be relevant for its antidepressant efficacy. © 2022, The Author(s).",0,"[0.9940639138221741, 0.005936126224696636]",0

OBJECTIVE: : Lamotrigine previously was found to attenuate ketamine‐induced behavioral changes and, in 2 placebo‐controlled trials, to improve psychosis when added to antipsychotic medication. We sought to evaluate the potential role of lamotrigine augmentation in schizophrenia patients resistant to atypical antipsychotic medication. METHODS: : Two multicenter, randomized, double‐blind, 12‐week, parallel‐group trials were conducted to compare flexibly dosed lamotrigine (100‐400 mg/d) with placebo as add‐on treatment in schizophrenia patients with stable, residual psychotic symptoms. The primary end point was changed in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score at week 12. RESULTS: : Two hundred seventeen patients were enrolled in study 1 and 212 in study 2; completion rates in the intent‐to‐treat samples were 71% and 74%, respectively, and did not differ between treatment groups. Overall, mean Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total scores improved in both studies and did not differ between treatment groups. In study 1, the Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms total score and Clinical Global Impression improved more with placebo than with lamotrigine; in study 2, the cognitive composite score improved more with lamotrigine than with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: : Results from these 2 studies do not support the use of lamotrigine as an adjunct to atypical antipsychotics in patients with refractory psychosis. It is unclear why positive results from previous lamotrigine trials were not replicated. The positive effect of lamotrigine on cognition in one trial, while of uncertain significance, may merit further study.",0,"[0.984387993812561, 0.01561194472014904]",0

7913,"Effects of monoamine oxidase inhibitor and cytochrome P450 2D6 status on 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine metabolism and pharmacokinetics.^
5-Methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) is a natural psychoactive indolealkylamine drug that has been used for recreational purpose. Our previous study revealed that polymorphic cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) catalyzed 5-MeO-DMT O-demethylation to produce active metabolite bufotenine, while 5-MeO-DMT is mainly inactivated through deamination pathway mediated by monoamine oxidase (MAO). This study, therefore, aimed to investigate the impact of CYP2D6 genotype/phenotype status and MAO inhibitor (MAOI) on 5-MeO-DMT metabolism and pharmacokinetics. Enzyme kinetic studies using recombinant CYP2D6 allelic isozymes showed that CYP2D6.2 and CYP2D6.10 exhibited 2.6- and 40-fold lower catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km), respectively, in producing bufotenine from 5-MeO-DMT, compared with wild-type CYP2D6.1. When co-incubated with MAOI pargyline, 5-MeO-DMT O-demethylation in 10 human liver microsomes showed significantly strong correlation with bufuralol 1′-hydroxylase activities (R2=0.98; P<0.0001) and CYP2D6 contents (R2=0.77; P=0.0007), whereas no appreciable correlations with enzymatic activities of other P450 enzymes. Furthermore, concurrent MAOI harmaline sharply reduced 5-MeO-DMT depletion and increased bufotenine formation in human CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer hepatocytes. In vivo studies in wild-type and CYP2D6-humanized (Tg-CYP2D6) mouse models showed that Tg-CYP2D6 mice receiving the same dose of 5-MeO-DMT (20mg/kg, i.p.) had 60% higher systemic exposure to metabolite bufotenine. In addition, pretreatment of harmaline (5mg/kg, i.p.) led to 3.6- and 4.4-fold higher systemic exposure to 5-MeO-DMT (2mg/kg, i.p.), and 9.9- and 6.1-fold higher systemic exposure to bufotenine in Tg-CYP2D6 and wild-type mice, respectively. These findings indicate that MAOI largely affects 5-MeO-DMT metabolism and pharmacokinetics, as well as bufotenine formation that is mediated by CYP2D6. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",1,"[0.30894821882247925, 0.6910517811775208]",1
2208,"Psilocybin Induces Aberrant Prediction Error Processing of Tactile Mismatch Responses - A Simultaneous EEG-FMRI Study.^
As source of sensory information, the body provides a sense of agency and self/non-self-discrimination. The integration of bodily states and sensory inputs with prior beliefs has been linked to the generation of bodily self-consciousness. The ability to detect surprising tactile stimuli is essential for the survival of an organism and for the formation of mental body representations. Despite the relevance for a variety of psychiatric disorders characterized by altered body and self-perception, the neurobiology of these processes is poorly understood. We therefore investigated the effect of psilocybin (Psi), known to induce alterations in self-experience, on tactile mismatch responses by combining pharmacological manipulations with simultaneous electroencephalography-functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) recording. Psi reduced activity in response to tactile surprising stimuli in frontal regions, the visual cortex, and the cerebellum. Furthermore, Psi reduced tactile mismatch negativity EEG responses at frontal electrodes, associated with alterations of body- and self-experience. This study provides first evidence that Psi alters the integration of tactile sensory inputs through aberrant prediction error processing and highlights the importance of the 5-HT2A system in tactile deviancy processing as well as in the integration of bodily and self-related stimuli. These findings may have important implications for the treatment of psychiatric disorders characterized by aberrant bodily self-awareness.",0,"[0.9876956939697266, 0.012304297648370266]",1
2482,"Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of low dose lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in healthy older volunteers.^
Research has shown that psychedelics, such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), have profound anti-inflammatory properties mediated by 5-HT(2A) receptor signaling, supporting their evaluation as a therapeutic for neuroinflammation associated with neurodegenerative disease. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of orally repeated administration of 5 μg, 10 μg, and 20 μg LSD in older healthy individuals. In the current paper, we present safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic measures that relate to safety, tolerability, and dose response. METHODS: This was a phase 1 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study. Volunteers were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 dose groups (5 μg, 10 μg, 20 μg LSD, and placebo), and received their assigned dose on six occasions (i.e., every 4 days). RESULTS: Forty-eight older healthy volunteers (mean age = 62.9 years) received placebo (n = 12), 5 μg (n = 12), 10 μg (n = 12), or 20 μg (n = 12) LSD. LSD plasma levels were undetectable for the 5 μg group and peak blood plasma levels for the 10 μg and 20 μg groups occurred at 30 min. LSD was well tolerated, and the frequency of adverse events was no higher than for placebo. Assessments of cognition, balance, and proprioception revealed no impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest safety and tolerability of orally administered 5 μg, 10 μg, and 20 μg LSD every fourth day over a 21-day period and support further clinical development of LSD for the treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD).",1,"[0.0025522205978631973, 0.9974478483200073]",1
7041,"Pharmacological effects of methylone and MDMA in humans.^
Methylone is one of the most common synthetic cathinones popularized as a substitute for 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, midomafetamine) owing to its similar effects among users. Both psychostimulants exhibit similar chemistry (i.e., methylone is a β-keto analog of MDMA) and mechanisms of action. Currently, the pharmacology of methylone remains scarcely explored in humans. Herein, we aimed to evaluate the acute pharmacological effects of methylone and its abuse potential in humans when compared with that of MDMA following oral administration under controlled conditions. Seventeen participants of both sexes (14 males, 3 females) with a previous history of psychostimulant use completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial. Participants received a single oral dose of 200 mg of methylone, 100 mg of MDMA, and a placebo. The variables included physiological effects (blood pressure, heart rate, oral temperature, pupil diameter), subjective effects using visual analog scales (VAS), the short form of the Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI), the Evaluation of Subjective Effects of Substances with Abuse Potential questionnaire (VESSPA-SSE), and the Sensitivity to Drug Reinforcement Questionnaire (SDRQ), and psychomotor performance (Maddox wing, psychomotor vigilance task). We observed that methylone could significantly increase blood pressure and heart rate and induce pleasurable effects, such as stimulation, euphoria, wellbeing, enhanced empathy, and altered perception. Methylone exhibited an effect profile similar to MDMA, with a faster overall onset and earlier disappearance of subjective effects. These results suggest that abuse potential of methylone is comparable to that of MDMA in humans.

7681,"Tri-city study of Ecstasy use problems: A latent class analysis.^
This study used latent class analysis to examine distinctive subtypes of Ecstasy users based on 24 abuse and dependence symptoms underlying standard DSM-IV criteria. Data came from a three site, population-based, epidemiological study to examine diagnostic nosology for Ecstasy use. Subject inclusion criteria included lifetime Ecstasy use exceeding five times and once in the past year, with participants ranging in age between 16 and 47 years of age from St. Louis, Miami, U.S. and Sydney, Australia. A satisfactory model typified four latent classes representing clearly differentiated diagnostic clusters including: (1) a group of sub-threshold users endorsing few abuse and dependence symptoms (negatives), (2) a group of 'diagnostic orphans' who had characteristic features of dependence for a select group of symptoms (mild dependent), (3) a 'transitional group' mimicking the orphans with regard to their profile of dependence also but reporting some abuse symptoms (moderate dependent), and (4) a 'severe dependent' group with a distinct profile of abuse and dependence symptoms. A multinomial logistic regression model indicated that certain latent classes showed unique associations with external non-diagnostic markers. Controlling for demographic characteristics and lifetime quantity of Ecstasy pill use, criminal behavior and motivational cues for Ecstasy use were the most efficient predictors of cluster membership. This study reinforces the heuristic utility of DSM-IV criteria applied to Ecstasy but with a different collage of symptoms that produced four distinct classes of Ecstasy users. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

5405,"Riluzole for relapse prevention following intravenous ketamine in treatment-resistant depression: a pilot randomized, placebo-controlled continuation trial.^
The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonist ketamine may have rapid, albeit transient, antidepressant properties. This study in patients with treatment-resistant major depression (TRD) aimed to (1) replicate the acute efficacy of single-dose intravenous (i.v.) ketamine; (2) test the efficacy of the glutamate-modulating agent riluzole in preventing post-ketamine relapse; and (3) examine whether pretreatment with lamotrigine would attenuate ketamine's psychotomimetic effects and enhance its antidepressant activity. Twenty-six medication-free patients received open-label i.v. ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min). Two hours prior to infusion, patients were randomized to lamotrigine (300 mg) or placebo. Seventeen patients (65%) met response criterion (50% reduction from baseline on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale) 24 h following ketamine. Lamotrigine failed to attenuate the mild, transient side-effects associated with ketamine and did not enhance its antidepressant effects. Fourteen patients (54%) met response criterion 72 h following ketamine and proceeded to participate in a 32-d, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible-dose continuation trial of riluzole (100-200 mg/d). The main outcome measure was time-to-relapse. An interim analysis found no significant differences in time-to-relapse between riluzole and placebo groups [log-rank chi(2) = 0.17, d.f. = 1, p = 0.68], with 80% of patients relapsing on riluzole vs. 50% on placebo. The trial was thus stopped for futility. This pilot study showed that a sub-anaesthetic dose of i.v. ketamine is well-tolerated in TRD, and may have rapid and sustained antidepressant properties. Riluzole did not prevent relapse in the first month following ketamine. Further investigation of relapse prevention strategies post-ketamine is necessary.",1,"[0.0028573109302669764, 0.9971426129341125]",1
1455,"Effects of Low-Dose Ketamine on the Antidepressant Efficacy and Suicidal Ideations in Patients Undergoing Electroconvulsive Therapy.^
OBJECTIVES: It remains controversial whether a subanesthetic dose of ketamine could modulate the antidepressant effect of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in patients with major depressive disorder. We investigated the effect of ketamine on accelerating the antidepressant efficacy of ECT. METHODS: One hundred twenty-seven patients with major depressive disorder were included in this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. The study group received 0.3 mg/kg ketamine, and the control group received an isovolumetric dose of normal saline before undergoing ECT under propofol anesthesia. The main outcome was the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score after each ECT session. Suicidal ideation (SI) was also evaluated using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. The response, remission, and recurrence rates were analyzed using time-to-event analysis. RESULTS: No significant differences were found in the overall response, remission, and relapse rates between the groups (P > 0.05). The median number of ECT sessions for achieving response was 4.0 ± 0.41 in the study group and 7.0 ± 0.79 in the control group (P < 0.05). The median number of ECT sessions for achieving remission in the study and control groups was 8.0 ± 0.29 and 9.0 ± 0.48, respectively (P < 0.05). The median number of ECT sessions for achieving SI reduction in the study and control groups was 3.0 ± 0.75 and 6.0 ± 1.19, respectively (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose ketamine (0.3 mg/kg) could modulate the antidepressant efficacy of ECT via accelerating the onset of its effects and reducing the number of ECT sessions required to obtain response, remission, and SI reduction, without influencing the relapse rates in remitting patients after ECT treatment.",1,"[0.0024790388997644186, 0.9975209832191467]",1

Data regarding change in cognitive performance from baseline to end-of-treatment and/or differences in cognition between ketamine and control groups were extracted. Results: There were no negative effects of single- or repeated-dose intravenous ketamine up to 2 weeks post-treatment in MDD. Limited data were available for BD populations, as well as on other routes of ketamine administration. Conclusions: Data to definitively answer the question of whether ketamine has substantive or persistent cognitive effects are insufficient; thus, larger controlled trials measuring cognition as the primary outcome are needed.

6130,"Morphine or/and Ketamine in Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrest.^
Almost 35 years ago, Dr Peter Safar wrote that ""cerebral recovery from more than 5 min of cardiac arrest is hampered by complex secondary derangements of multiple organ systems after reperfusion"". Actually, these 5 ""golden"" minutes determine the ability of cerebral neurones to regain ordinary function after anoxia. The ordinary function of cerebral neurones is conduction of electrical impulses across their length from the post‐synaptic membrane of dendrites to the presynaptic membrane of an axon. The process is based on exchange of Ca2+, Na+ and K+ between the extra‐ and intracellular space of cerebral neurones, and therefore a lot of energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is needed to remove Ca2+ and Na+ from the intracellular space of these cells. Cardiac arrest (CA) initiates a switch to glycolytic metabolism with very low production of ATP and the increased levels of lactate and H+. Both acidosis and the lack of ATP inhibit the ions pumps, which are responsible for handling excessive intracellular accumulation of Ca2+ and Na+. Preclinical studies demonstrate that acute hypoxia results in an uncontrolled release of glutamate with consequent stimulation of the N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptors causing also an excessive Ca2+ influx. Meanwhile, the ATP reservoir in neurones can be completely depleted after 5 minutes of no‐flow state. In case of oxygen supplying restoration, two molecules of ATP are initially required to split glucose and restart the cellular respiration. Thus, the presence or absence of these two molecules of ATP in neurones actually determine restoring of both oxidative phosphorylation and the ordinary function of the neurones. Finally, prolonged intracellular Ca2+ overload results in increased mitochondrial permeability causing following release of cytochrome C from mitochondria, and consequent cleavage and activation of caspase‐3. Caspase‐3 is an essential protease, which is involved in the early stage of apoptosis and it is generally accepted as a hallmark of irreversible cell death. Interestingly, in an experimental study with rats, the activation of caspase‐3 was observed in a significant number of neurones of the cerebellum and neocortex only after 9 hours following asphyxial cardiac arrest. Today, only therapeutic hypothermia has been shown to have a beneficial impact on the ion pump dysfunction, and thereby reduce neurotoxicity. Interestingly, in hibernators, hypothermia is also believed to protect against hypoxic brain damage. Meanwhile, if naloxone, a non selective opioid receptor antagonist, is injected during the maintenance phase of hibernation, arousal is quickly achieved and the protective effects are vanished. Delta opioid peptides, previously discovered to induce hibernation have also been shown to protect rats from hypoxic brain damage. Based on the ability of opioids to reduce the level of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and consequently to block Na+ channels, it would be logical to propose that opioids might prevent the disturbance of ionic homeostasis during acute hypoxia. Indeed, preclinical studies demonstrate that opioids can preserve cellular integrity status during acute hypoxia in many organs and tissues including: intestine, skeletal muscle, myocardium and brain. Moreover, Morphine has been shown to significantly increase the survival of mice and rats in acute hypoxia conditions. In the experimental model with rats exposed to hypoxic gas (5% oxygen, 95% N2) for 70 min, all seven rats in the naloxone pre‐treated group died at the end of the experiments while only one out of seven rats died in the Morphine (5 mg/kg) pretreated group, and five from the seven rats died in the control group. In the experiments where the rats were exposed to 8 min anoxia, pre‐treatment with Morphine (5mg/kg), or Ketamine (40 mg/kg), resulted in higher survival in both groups as compared to the control group (data not yet published). No publications looking at the survival rate in animals with treatment by Morphine before cardiac arrest have been p blished yet. Meanwhile, two recent retrospective studies demonstrated that patients who were treated with opioids before or during cardiac arrest had a statistically significantly higher survival rate and much better neurological outcome compared to untreated patients. Recently published data shows that the Na+ influx initiating the action potential in neurones consumes one third the ATP of synaptic potentials associated with Ca2+ influx. In theory, Ketamine that inhibits the synaptic potentials by NMDA receptor blockade, might save much more ATP in the neurones compared to Morphine, which inhibits only Na+ influx and accordingly the action potentials. Certainly, after restoration of blood flow, the residual saved ATP may contribute to restoration of both neuronal oxidative phosphorylation and ionic exchange. Newly published experimental data demonstrates that pre‐treatment of zebrafish with Ketamine protects against cardiac arrest induced brain injury by inhibiting Ca2+ wave propagation, which consequently improves survival rate. Contrary to the results seen in these studies, two NMDA antagonist, MK‐801 and GPI‐3000 in high doses did not improve survival rate and brain outcome after cardiac arrest and resuscitation in a dog model. These studies did not suggest any mechanisms of the negative results, but they contributed to a lack of interest for testing NMDA blockade in CA for years. More recently, a study of the effects of using the noncompetitive NMDA antagonist Ifenprodil demonstrated a significant reduction of brain oedema following asphyxial cardiac arrest in rats. In this study, i.v. injection of Ifenprodil also resulted in much more stable hemodynamic status after CA as compared with salt treated animals. Another experimental study of different anaesthesia regimes in a rodent cardiac arrest model also demonstrated much better hemodynamic status in the early post resuscitation period in the rats treated with Ketamine and Medetomidine as compared to anaesthesia with Sevoflurane and Fentanyl. All anaesthetics, with their ability to antagonise glutamate mediated excitotoxicity and inflammation might be logical candidates for neuroprotective treatment during cardiac arrest. However, the ability of anaesthetics to produce vasodilatation with a significant reduction of blood perfusing pressure can be the main argument against the idea to test their effects during cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in human. However, due to their minimal influences on hemodynamic status in therapeutic doses, Ketamine as well as Morphine can be considered as the safe candidates during neuroprotective treatment trials in CPR patients. Another argument for possible application of Morphine or Ketamine during CPR could be as an analgesic. Vigorous thoracic compression with possible trauma of the ribs may lead to severe pain and stress reactions in patients surviving CPR. The rationale for analysing plasma levels of S‐100B protein and NSE in this trial will be their different distribution within the white (S100B protein) and grey (NSE) matter of the brain, and the fact that both of them are extensively involved in the pathogenesis of anoxial brain damage. S100 B protein is an intracellular calcium‐binding dimer that has a molecular weight of 21 kDa and two hours of half life. Thanks to the low molecular weight, S100 B protein easily cross the blood‐brain barrier and rapidly end up in the systemic circulation. NSE is a neuronal isoform of the glycolytic enzyme enolase that has a molecular weight of 78 kDa and a twenty four hours half life. Further, NSE is extensively involved in glucose metabolism in the neurones and can be detected only in neuronal and neuroendocrine tissues. Due to this organ specificity, concentration of NSE in blood is often elevated as a result of relative rapid and massive neuronal destruction. In clinical practice, elevated serum NSE levels, above 30 ng/ml, correlate well with a poor outcome in coma, particularly when caused by an hypoxic insult. Thus, these two markers of early neuronal damage is a good fi for testing the neuroprotective features of Morphine or Ketamine application during CPR. A retrospective evaluation of patients after cardiac arrest in the University hospital of Northern Norway demonstrated significantly higher 1, 2, 3 and 28 days survival rate and reduced duration of CPR in the patients additionally treated with opioids compared to ordinary resuscitation. Two years later another retrospective, observational cohort study from Pittsburgh, USA reported that despite poor baseline prognostic factors, survival after recreational drug overdose‐related cardiac arrests (CA) was no worse than after non overdose‐related arrest, and among survivors the majority had a good neurological outcome. Interestingly, the same research group reported in one previous retrospective study a higher rate of survival to hospital discharge (19% vs. 12%, p = 0.014) in the overdose CA group compared to the non‐overdoses one. However, patients in these overdose cases were significantly younger (45 vs. 65, p < 0.001), but less likely to be witnessed by a bystander (29% vs. 41%, p < 0.005). Suspected overdose cases had a higher overall chest compression fraction (0.69 vs. 0.67, p = 0.018) and higher probability of adrenaline, sodium bicarbonate, and atropine administration (p < 0.001). Application of Naloxone in these overdose cases might have had an influence on survival as well. One previously published clinical case described full neurological recovery in a young man who overdosed on opioids and who regained sinus rhythm many minutes after resuscitation had been abandoned. Based on all of the above, it can be hypothesised that treatment with Morphine or Ketamine might have a beneficial impact on the conservation of ATP in the brain, and thereby the treatment might increase the ability of cerebral neurones to survive and regain ordinary function after CPR.",0,"[0.982194185256958, 0.01780589111149311]",0
1383,"Cluster randomised controlled trial of an online intervention to prevent ecstasy and new psychoactive substance use among adolescents: final results and implications for implementation.^
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of the online Climate Schools: Ecstasy and Emerging Drugs module over 2 years, and examine the impact of intervention dose on outcomes. DESIGN: Cluster randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Secondary schools in Australia. PARTICIPANTS: 1126 students (aged 14.9 years) from 11 schools. INTERVENTION: Five schools were randomly allocated to the four-lesson internet-based Climate Schools: Ecstasy and Emerging Drugs module. This universal intervention uses cartoon storylines to deliver harm-minimisation information about ecstasy and new psychoactive substances (NPS). It was delivered during health education classes over 4 weeks. Six schools were randomised to the control group (health education as usual). Participants were not blinded to intervention allocation. OUTCOMES MEASURES: Students completed self-report surveys at baseline, post-test, 6, 12 and 24 months post-baseline. Intentions to use ecstasy and NPS (including synthetic cannabis and synthetic stimulants), knowledge about ecstasy and NPS and lifetime use of ecstasy and NPS were assessed. This paper reports the results at 24 months post-baseline. ANALYSIS: Mixed effects regressions were conducted to analyse intervention effects from baseline to 24 months. Post hoc analyses using Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting compared controls with students who: i) completed all four lessons ('full dose') and ii) partially completed the intervention (≤three lessons, 'incomplete dose'). RESULTS: Primary analyses found that controls were significantly more likely to intend on using synthetic cannabis compared with intervention group students (OR=3.56, p=0.01). Results from the weighted analyses indicated that controls reported significantly lower knowledge about ecstasy (p=0.001) and NPS (p=0.04) compared with the full-dose group. No significant differences were observed between the incomplete dose and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: The online intervention was effective in modifying students' intentions to use synthetic cannabis up to 24 months; however, this study highlights the importance of delivering prevention programmes in full to maximise student outcomes.

8498,"AUD Readmission Risk Lower With Pre-Discharge Ketamine Infusion or Naltrexone Injection.^
Introduction: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) impacts 15 million Americans [1], leading to 5 million annual emergency department (ED) visits and 2 million inpatient admissions [2]. Hospitalization is a vital opportunity to initiate addiction recovery, and two single‐dose, adherenceindependent, pharmacologic interventions ‐ intravenous (IV) ketamine and intramuscular (IM) naltrexone ‐ are well‐suited to administer before discharge. However, their feasibility and effectiveness at reducing re‐admissions among AUD inpatients are not well established. Methods: Our open‐label pilot trial randomized participants to 1) IM naltrexone injection, 2) IV ketamine infusion, or 3) enhanced‐linkage alone. Adult (age 18‐65), hospitalized participants with severe AUD and at least one past‐year hospital encounter were recruited through an addiction consultation service at an urban, safety‐net hospital. Exclusion criteria included psychiatric instability, severe hepatic or cardiac disease, chronic or planned opioid use, and other severe substance use disorders. The primary aim was to test feasibility, and the primary clinical outcome was 30‐day, all‐cause re‐admission rate. Secondary clinical outcomes included 30‐day emergency department (ED) visit rate and 14‐day outpatient addiction clinic follow‐up rate. Results: Participants (n = 44) were mean 45.1 years‐old, 20.5% female, 56.8% white/Caucasian, 34.1% Hispanic, 61.4% stably housed. All interventions were feasible, with approximately 3.8 participants recruited per month, no serious adverse events reported, and 90.9% with complete inpatient protocol adherence. For the linkage‐alone (LA), naltrexone (NTX), and ketamine (KET) arms, the thirty‐day readmission rates were 41.2, 21.4, and 15.4% respectively. Thirty‐day emergency department rates were 70.6, 57.1, and 53.9% respectively. Fourteen‐day follow up rates were 41.2, 50.0, and 61.5% respectively. Comparing the KET arm to the LA arm, the relative risk of readmission was 0.37 (P = 0.17). Comparing the NTX arm to the LA arm, the relative risk of readmission 0.52 (P = 0.27) DISCUSSION: A single ketamine infusion or naltrexone injection given pre‐discharge, combined with enhanced treatment linkage, are feasible and may reduce readmission rates among medically hospitalized patients with AUD, though the differences did not reach statistical significance. Our results are consistent with Dakwar et al. [3] who demonstrated beneficial effects with a single ketamine infusion compared to their active control, midazolam, among a lower‐acuity AUD population. IM naltrexone ‐ representing an aspirational standard of care ‐ also demonstrated favorable outcomes compared to the LA arm. A lack of blinding may have introduced expectancy effects for the two pharmacologic interventions. Moreover, despite randomization, the linkage alone arm appeared to be more housing insecure, male, and predisposed to care utilization than the other arms. The ketamine arm had a lower baseline daily quantity of alcohol than the other arms. Next steps include further dissemination of results and planning a larger, blinded trial. If effective in recovery initiation, IV ketamine and/or IM naltrexone could represent a novel addition to the inpatient standard of care for AUD. Conclusions: In this randomized pilot trial among hospitalized AUD patients, both the ketamine infusion and naltrexone injection arms showed lower readmission rates and higher outpatient follow‐up rates compared to the linkage alone arm, though results were not statistically significant.",1,"[0.004372000228613615, 0.9956279993057251]",1
8751,"Intravenous esketamine leads to an increase in impulsive and suicidal behaviour in a patient with recurrent major depression and borderline personality disorder.^
Objectives: As clinical studies demonstrated that ketamine possesses rapid-acting antidepressant and antisuicidal effects, it is increasingly used in affective disorders. The neuroplastic properties of ketamine are well described in preclinical and imaging studies, and are highly related to its antidepressive mechanism of action.Methods: Here, we report on a female patient with recurrent major depression and borderline personality disorder (BPD) who was treated with intravenous (i.v.) esketamine as rapid-acting augmentation therapy to improve severe and acute depressive symptoms and suicidal behaviour.Results: Esketamine led to an initial improvement of these symptoms. However, during the course of treatment, loosened and disinhibited behaviour and severe suicidal ideation occurred during and immediately after esketamine application. Hence, i.v. esketamine was discontinued, and she further received treatment as usual, which demonstrated to be beneficial.Conclusions: With current knowledge at hand, one cannot exclude esketamine's effects on the equilibrium of neural plasticity in brain networks, potentially initiating undesirable symptoms as impulsive behaviour and emotional dysregulation. Therefore, until investigations focus on efficacy and side effects profile of esketamine in depressed patients with (comorbid) BPD, treatment with this fast-acting medication should be considered with caution in this patient group.",1,"[0.00645584287121892, 0.9935442209243774]",1
5858,"Inhibition of 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine Metabolism Leads to Marked Decrease in 3,4-Dihydroxymethamphetamine Formation But No Change in Serotonin Neurotoxicity: Implications for Mechanisms of Neurotoxicity.^
3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)'s O-demethylenated metabolite, 3,4-dihydroxymethamphetamine (HHMA), has been hypothesized to serve as a precursor for the formation of toxic catechol-thioether metabolites (e.g., 5-N-acetylcystein-S-yl-HHMA) that mediate MDMA neurotoxicity. To further test this hypothesis, HHMA formation was blocked with dextromethorphan (DXM), which competitively inhibits cytochrome P450 enzyme-mediated O-demethylenation of MDMA to HHMA. In particular, rats were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups (n = 9-12 per group): (1) Saline/MDMA; (2) DXM/MDMA; (3) DXM/Saline; (4) Saline/Saline. During drug exposure, time-concentration profiles of MDMA and its metabolites were determined, along with body temperature. One week later, brain serotonin (5-HT) neuronal markers were measured in the same animals. DXM did not significantly alter core temperature in MDMA-treated animals. A large (greater than 70%) decrease in HHMA formation had no effect on the magnitude of MDMA neurotoxicity. These results cast doubt on the role of HHMA-derived catechol-thioether metabolites in the mechanism of MDMA neurotoxicity. Synapse 65:983-990, 2011.

730,"Ketamine as an adjuvant to opioids for cancer pain.^
BACKGROUND: Ketamine is a commonly used anaesthetic agent, and in subanaesthetic doses is also given as an adjuvant to opioids for the treatment of cancer pain, particularly when opioids alone prove to be ineffective. Ketamine is known to have hallucinogenic side effects. To date no systematic review of the benefits and harms of adjuvant ketamine for cancer pain has been undertaken. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness and adverse effects of ketamine as an adjuvant to opioids in the treatment of cancer pain. SEARCH STRATEGY: Studies were identified from MEDLINE (1966-2001), EMBASE (1980-2001), CancerLit (1966-2001), the Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2001); by handsearching reference lists from review articles, trials, and chapters from standard textbooks on pain and palliative care. The manufacturer of ketamine (Pfizer Parke-Davis) provided search results from their in-house database, PARDLARS. SELECTION CRITERIA: RCTs of adult patients with cancer and pain being treated with an opioid, and receiving either ketamine (any dose and any route of administration) or placebo or an active control. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two independent reviewers identified four RCTs for possible inclusion in the review, and 32 case studies/case series reports. Quality and validity assessment was performed by three independent reviewers, and two RCTs were excluded because of inappropriate study design. Patient reported pain intensity and pain relief was assessed using visual analog scales, verbal rating scales or other validated scales, and adverse effects data were collated. MAIN RESULTS: Two trials were eligible for inclusion in the review and both concluded that ketamine improves the effectiveness of morphine in the treatment of cancer pain. However, pooling of the data was not appropriate because of the small total number of patients (30), and the presence of clinical heterogeneity. Some patients experienced hallucinations on both ketamine plus morphine and morphine alone and were treated successfully with diazepam. No other serious adverse effects were reported. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence is insufficient to assess the benefits and harms of ketamine as an adjuvant to opioids for the relief of cancer pain. More randomized controlled trials are needed.",1,"[0.05532719939947128, 0.9446728229522705]",0
3719,"Turn on, Tune in, and Drop out: Predictors of Attrition in a Prospective Observational Cohort Study on Psychedelic Use.^
BACKGROUND: The resurgence of research and public interest in the positive psychological effects of psychedelics, together with advancements in digital data collection techniques, have brought forth a new type of research design, which involves prospectively gathering large-scale naturalistic data from psychedelic users; that is, before and after the use of a psychedelic compound. A methodological limitation of such studies is their high attrition rate, particularly owing to participants who stop responding after initial study enrollment. Importantly, study dropout can introduce systematic biases that may affect the interpretability of results. OBJECTIVE: Based on a previously collected sample (baseline n=654), here we investigated potential determinants of study attrition in web-based prospective studies on psychedelic use. METHODS: Logistic regression models were used to examine demographic, psychological trait and state, and psychedelic-specific predictors of dropout. Predictors were assessed 1 week before, 1 day after, and 2 weeks after psychedelic use, with attrition being defined as noncompletion of the key endpoint 4 weeks post experience. RESULTS: Predictors of attrition were found among demographic variables including age (β=0.024; P=.007) and educational levels, as well as personality traits, specifically conscientiousness (β=-0.079; P=.02) and extraversion (β=0.082; P=.01). Contrary to prior hypotheses, neither baseline attitudes toward psychedelics nor the intensity of acute challenging experiences were predictive of dropout. CONCLUSIONS: The baseline predictors of attrition identified here are consistent with those reported in longitudinal studies in other scientific disciplines, suggesting their transdisciplinary relevance. Moreover, the lack of an association between attrition and psychedelic advocacy or negative drug experiences in our sample contextualizes concerns about problematic biases in these and related data.",1,"[0.003972660284489393, 0.9960273504257202]",1
2789,"Functional connectivity signatures of NMDAR dysfunction in schizophrenia-integrating findings from imaging genetics and pharmaco-fMRI.^
Both, pharmacological and genome-wide association studies suggest N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) dysfunction and excitatory/inhibitory (E/I)-imbalance as a major pathophysiological mechanism of schizophrenia. The identification of shared fMRI brain signatures of genetically and pharmacologically induced NMDAR dysfunction may help to define biomarkers for patient stratification. NMDAR-related genetic and pharmacological effects on functional connectivity were investigated by integrating three different datasets: (A) resting state fMRI data from 146 patients with schizophrenia genotyped for the disease-associated genetic variant rs7191183 of GRIN2A (encoding the NMDAR 2 A subunit) as well as 142 healthy controls. (B) Pharmacological effects of the NMDAR antagonist ketamine and the GABA-A receptor agonist midazolam were obtained from a double-blind, crossover pharmaco-fMRI study in 28 healthy participants. (C) Regional gene expression profiles were estimated using a postmortem whole-brain microarray dataset from six healthy donors. A strong resemblance was observed between the effect of the genetic variant in schizophrenia and the ketamine versus midazolam contrast of connectivity suggestive for an associated E/I-imbalance. This similarity became more pronounced for regions with high density of NMDARs, glutamatergic neurons, and parvalbumin-positive interneurons. From a functional perspective, increased connectivity emerged between striato-pallido-thalamic regions and cortical regions of the auditory-sensory-motor network, while decreased connectivity was observed between auditory (superior temporal gyrus) and visual processing regions (lateral occipital cortex, fusiform gyrus, cuneus). Importantly, these imaging phenotypes were associated with the genetic variant, the differential effect of ketamine versus midazolam and schizophrenia (as compared to healthy controls). Moreover, the genetic variant was associated with language-related negative symptomatology which correlated with disturbed connectivity between the left posterior superior temporal gyrus and the superior lateral occipital cortex. Shared genetic and pharmacological functional connectivity profiles were suggestive of E/I-imbalance and associated with schizophrenia. The identified brain signatures may help to stratify patients with a common molecular disease pathway providing a basis for personalized psychiatry.",1,"[0.027843743562698364, 0.9721562266349792]",1
8359,"Assessment of Withdrawal, Mood, and Sleep Inventories After Monitored 3-Week Abstinence in Cannabis-Using Adolescents and Young Adults.^
Introduction: Among adolescents and young adults, cannabis use is prevalent. Prior studies characterizing withdrawal effects in this age range have primarily included treatment seeking or comorbid psychiatric samples; these studies have identified several affected domains, especially sleep, mood, and anxiety. The present study compared a community (i.e., nontreatment seeking) sample of cannabis-using and control participants on mood, anxiety, sleep, and withdrawal inventories during the course of a monitored 3-week cannabis abstinence period. Materials and Methods: Seventy-nine adolescent and young adult participants (cannabis-using group=37 and control group=42) were recruited from the community to undergo 3 weeks of confirmed abstinence (i.e., urine and sweat patch toxicology) and completion of Cannabis Withdrawal Symptom Criteria, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Beck's Depression Inventory, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index across the study period. Repeated measures and cross-sectional regressions were used to examine main effects of group and interactions with time (where appropriate), while accounting for recent alcohol use and cotinine levels. Results: Cannabis-using participants reported higher mood (p=0.006), overall withdrawal (p=0.009), and sleep-related withdrawal (p<0.001) symptoms across abstinence compared to controls. Overall withdrawal severity (p=0.04) and sleep-related withdrawal symptoms (p=0.02) demonstrated a quadratic trajectory across the monitored abstinence periods, with an increase from baseline and subsequent decreases in symptom severity. No differences of anxiety scores (p=0.07) or trajectories (p=0.18) were observed. By study completion, groups did not differ among sleep quality components (all p's>.05). Conclusions: These findings revealed that nontreatment-seeking cannabis-using adolescents and young adults reported heightened total withdrawal symptoms during a 3-week sustained abstinence period relative to controls. Cannabis-using participants demonstrated an increase in withdrawal symptom trajectory during the first week followed by decreased symptoms from weeks 2 to 3, which contrasts with prior linear decreases observed in cannabis-using adolescent and young adults. More mood symptoms were observed in the cannabis-using group even while excluding for comorbid psychopathologies-along with significantly more sleep problems during the abstinence period. Implications include the necessity to provide psychoeducation for recreational, nontreatment-seeking cannabis-using individuals about cannabis withdrawal, mood symptoms, and sleep quality difficulties when cannabis cessation is attempted, to improve likelihood of long-term sustained abstinence.",0,"[0.9711750745773315, 0.028825001791119576]",0
1114,"Enantioselective quantitation of the ecstasy compound (R)- and (S)-N-ethyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine and its major metabolites in human plasma and urine.^
An enantioselective HPLC method has been developed and validated for the stereospecific analysis of N-ethyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDE) and its major metabolites N-ethyl-4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine (HME) and 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA). These compounds have been analyzed both from human plasma and urine after administration of 70 mg pure MDE-hydrochloride enantiomers to four subjects. The samples were prepared by hydrolysis of the o-glucuronate and sulfate conjugates using beta-glucuronidase/arylsulfatase and solid-phase extraction with a cation-exchange phase. A chiral stationary protein phase (chiral-CBH) was used for the stereoselective determination of MDE, HME and MDA in a single HPLC run using sodium dihydrogenphosphate, ethylendiaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt and isopropanol as the mobile phase (pH 6.44) and fluorimetric detection (lambda(ex) 286 nm, lambda(em) 322 nm). Moreover, a suitable internal standard (N-ethyl-3,4-methylenedioxybenzylamine) was synthesized and qualified for quantitation purposes. The method showed high recovery rates (>95%) and limits of quantitation for MDE and MDA of 5 ng/ml and for HME of 10 ng/ml. The RSDs for all working ranges of MDE, MDA and HME in plasma and urine, respectively, were less than 1.5%. After validation of the analytical methods in plasma and urine samples pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. The plasma concentrations of (R)-MDE exceeded those of the S-enantiomer (ratio R:S of the area under the curve, 3.1) and the plasma half time of (R)-MDE was longer than that of (S)-MDE (7.9 vs. 4.0 h). In contrast, the stereochemical disposition of the MDE metabolites HME and MDA was reversed. Concentrations of the (S)-metabolites in plasma of volunteers were much higher than those of the (R)-enantiomers.",1,"[0.0029961273539811373, 0.9970038533210754]",1

OBJECTIVE: Depression relapse after electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is common (40% at 6 months). Ketamine has a robust antidepressant effect, but there are no reported studies of ketamine for depression relapse prevention. This pilot trial (NCT02414932) was designed to assess feasibility of the proposed trial protocol, including examining reasons for nonrecruitment, nonrandomization, and dropout. METHODS: Patients with unipolar depression referred for ECT were monitored weekly for therapeutic response, using the 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (monitoring phase). Those who met standard response criteria were invited to be randomized to a course of 4 once-weekly infusions of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or the active comparator, midazolam (0.045 mg/kg), over 40 minutes to examine trial processes (treatment phase). Participants were followed up for 6 months after ECT to assess for relapse. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-five referrals were screened over 18 months, and 68% of eligible participants (n = 43) were recruited to the monitoring phase; 60.5% of participants met ECT response criteria (n = 26), but only 26% (6) of these consented to take part in the treatment phase. These were randomized (3 to ketamine and 3 to midazolam), and no participant completed the 4-week treatment protocol. Information was gathered on reasons for nonrecruitment, nonrandomization, and dropout, which included practical aspects of infusions and lack of interest in further treatment after response to ECT.

6969,"Spiritual experiences in psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy: Case reports of communion with the divine, the departed, and saints in research using psilocybin for the treatment of alcohol dependence.^
Psychedelic substances have been central to religious and shamanic healing practices of various cultures for generations. More recently, in western medicine, psychedelic substances have demonstrated promise in the treatment of various mental health indications. A growing evidence base supports not only the therapeutic potential of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, but also the importance of integrating spiritual aspects of psychedelic experiences into the traditional therapeutic process. Psilocybin, a classic psychedelic, is a serotonergic hallucinogen that can elicit profound spiritual experiences even in the research setting. Our group is currently conducting a randomized controlled trial exploring the therapeutic potential of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for alcohol dependence. Over the course of the trial, many individuals have reported experiences that take a variety of forms, including spiritual insights, beatific visions, and communion with the Divine. Here we present three case studies of experiences involving communion with a deceased loved one, with a holy figure, and with the Divine from our clinical trial. These cases have been selected to illustrate the diverse nature of the spiritual experiences observed in this clinical trial, and to also explore elements of spiritual care that may be supportive in the psychotherapeutic process during and after the medication experiences. Should psychedelic medicine continue to show treatment promise in clinical trial stages, there is a strong possibility that these medicines will become an integral part of psychotherapy, which will require integration of direct spiritual experiences and spiritual care into the healing process.

Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) remains one of the major psychiatric challenges worldwide. Search for non-monoaminergic agents, possibly effective in treatment of TRD is of prime importance. One of those agents is ketamine – a dissociative, anesthetic drug exhibiting a fast antidepressant action in patients with TRD. Concurrently, anhedonia appears to be significant symptom domain with far-reaching impact on course of treatment. There is data demonstrating that abnormal copper levels might be associated with symptoms of depression.

Hypofunction of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) may be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. NMDAR antagonists like ketamine induce schizophrenia-like features in humans. In rodent studies, NMDAR antagonism impairs learning by disrupting long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus. This study investigated the effects of ketamine on spatial learning (acquisition) vs retrieval in a virtual Morris water task in humans. Verbal fluency, working memory, and learning and memory of verbal information were also assessed. Healthy human subjects participated in this double-blinded, placebo-controlled study. On two separate occasions, ketamine/placebo was administered and cognitive tasks were assessed in association with behavioral ratings. Ketamine impaired learning of spatial and verbal information but retrieval of information learned prior to drug administration was preserved. Schizophrenia-like symptoms were significantly related to spatial and verbal learning performance. Ketamine did not significantly impair attention, verbal fluency, or verbal working memory task performance. Spatial working memory was slightly impaired. In conclusion, these results provide evidence for ketamine's differential impairment of verbal and spatial learning vs retrieval. By using the Morris water task, which is hippocampal-dependent, this study helps bridge the gap between nonhuman animal and human NMDAR antagonism research. Impaired cognition is a core feature of schizophrenia. A better understanding of NMDA antagonism, its physiological and cognitive consequences, may provide improved models of psychosis and cognitive therapeutics.

1941,"Memory and mood during MDMA intoxication, with and without memantine pretreatment.^
Previous studies have shown that single doses of MDMA can affect mood and impair memory in humans. The neuropharmacological mechanisms involved in MDMA-induced memory impairment are not clear. Memantine, an NMDA and alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor antagonist, was able to reverse MDMA-induced memory impairment in rats. This study investigated whether treatment with memantine can prevent MDMA-induced memory impairment in humans. 15 subjects participated in a double-blind, placebo controlled, within-subject design. Subjects received both pre-treatment (placebo/memantine 20 mg) (T1) and treatment (placebo/MDMA 75 mg) (T2) on separate test days. T1 preceded T2 by 120 min. Memory function was assessed 90 min after T2 by means of a Visual Verbal Learning Task, a Prospective Memory Task, the Sternberg Memory Task and the Abstract Visual Pattern Learning Task. Profile of Mood State and psychomotor performance were also assessed to control whether MDMA and memantine interactions would selectively pertain to memory or transfer to other domains as well. MDMA significantly impaired performance in the visual verbal learning task and abstract visual pattern learning task. Pre-treatment with memantine did not prevent MDMA-induced memory impairment in these two tasks. Both positive (vigour, arousal, elation) and negative mood effects (anxiety) were increased by MDMA. The responses were not altered by pretreatment with memantine which had no effect on memory or mood when given alone. These preliminary results suggest that memantine does not reverse MDMA-induced memory impairment and mood in humans.

8035,"Neurobehavioral outcomes of infants exposed to MDMA (Ecstasy) and other recreational drugs during pregnancy.^
3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) or ""Ecstasy"" is one of the most widely used illicit recreational drugs among young adults. MDMA is an indirect monoaminergic agonist and reuptake inhibitor that primarily affects the serotonin system. Preclinical studies in animals have found prenatal exposure related to neonatal tremors and long-term learning and memory impairments. To date, there are no prospective studies of the sequelae of prenatal exposure to MDMA in humans, despite concerns about its potential for harmful effects to the fetus. The present study is the first to prospectively identify MDMA-using women during pregnancy and to document patterns and correlates of use with neonatal and early infancy outcomes of offspring.All mothers and infants were prospectively recruited through the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) and University of East London (UEL) Drugs and Infancy Study (DAISY) that focused on recreational drug use in pregnant women. Women were interviewed about substance use prior to and during pregnancy and infants were seen at 1 and 4. months using standardized, normative assessments of neonatal behavior, and cognitive and motor development, including the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS), the Bayley Mental and Motor Development Scales (MDI, PDI), and the Alberta Infant Motor Scales (AIMS). The sample was primarily middle class with some university education and in stable partner relationships. The majority of women recruited had taken a number of illicit drugs prior to or during pregnancy. Group differences between those polydrug using women who had specifically used MDMA during pregnancy (n. =. 28) and those who had not (n. =. 68) were assessed using chi-square and t-tests. MDMA and other drug effects were assessed through multiple regression analyses controlling for confounding variables.Women who used MDMA during pregnancy had fewer prior births and more negative sequelae associated with their drug use, including more health, work, and social problems. MDMA exposed infants differed in sex ratio (more male births) and had poorer motor quality and lower milestone attainment at 4. months, with a dose-response relationship to amount of MDMA exposure. These findings suggest risk to the developing infant related to MDMA exposure and warrant continued follow-up to determine whether early motor delays persist or resolve. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",1,"[0.007690634112805128, 0.9923093318939209]",1
5816,"Ecstasy (MDMA): a review of its possible persistent psychological effects.^
Rationale: Recreational use of ""ecstasy"" (3.4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine; MDMA) has become increasingly widespread. Until recently, however, little was known about the possible persistent psychological effects of extensive use of this drug. Objective: The aim of the present review is to evaluate recent empirical evidence concerning the persistent psychological sequelae of recreational ecstasy use. Methods: The methodologies of open trial studies of recreational ecstasy users are evaluated and reports of the presence or absence of persistent psychological problems are related to the extent of past exposure to ecstasy. Results: There is growing evidence that chronic, heavy, recreational use of ecstasy is associated with sleep disorders, depressed mood, persistent elevation of anxiety, impulsiveness and hostility and selective impairment of episodic memory, working memory and attention. There is tentative evidence that these cognitive deficits persist for at least 6 months: after abstinence, whereas anxiety and hostility remit after a year of abstinence. The possibility that some of these psychological problems are caused by ecstasy-induced neurotoxicity is supported by preclinical evidence of MDMA-induced neurotoxicity and behavioural deficits, evidence of depleted serotonin in heavy ecstasy users, and by dose-response relationships between the extent of exposure to ecstasy and the severity of cognitive impairments. Conclusions An increasing number of young, heavy ecstasy users are at significant risk of persistent cognitive impairments and disturbances of affect and personality. Some of these problems may remit after abstinence, but residual neurotoxicity and decline of serotonergic, function with age may result in recurrent psychopathology and premature cognitive decline.",1,"[0.057439353317022324, 0.9425606727600098]",1
3334,"Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder: what do we know after 50 years?.^
'Flashbacks' following use of hallucinogenic drugs have been reported for decades; they are recognized in DSM-IV as 'Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder (Flashbacks)', or HPPD. We located and analyzed 20 quantitative studies between 1955 and 2001 examining this phenomenon. However, many of these studies were performed before operational criteria for HPPD were published in DSM-III-R, so they are difficult to interpret in the light of current diagnostic criteria. Overall, current knowledge of HPPD remains very limited. In particular (1) the term 'flashbacks' is defined in so many ways that it is essentially valueless; (2) most studies provide too little information to judge how many cases could meet DSM-IV criteria for HPPD; and consequently (3) information about risk factors for HPPD, possible etiologic mechanisms, and potential treatment modalities must be interpreted with great caution. At present, HPPD appears to be a genuine but uncommon disorder, sometimes persisting for months or years after hallucinogen use and causing substantial morbidity. It is reported most commonly after illicit LSD use, but less commonly with LSD administered in research or treatment settings, or with use of other types of hallucinogens. There are case reports, but no randomized controlled trials, of successful treatment with neuroleptics, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, and clonidine. Although it may be difficult to collect large samples of HPPD cases, further studies are critically needed to augment the meager data presently available regarding the prevalence, etiology, and treatment of HPPD.",0,"[0.9922497272491455, 0.007750250864773989]",0
2537,"Ketamine for posttraumatic stress disorder—Reply.^
Replies to comments by Keith G. Rasmussen (see record [rid]2015-03879-013[/rid]) on the original article (see record [rid]2014-26168-013[/rid]). In his correspondence referencing our published proof of- concept randomized clinical trial of intravenous ketamine for chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)1 and another study published by our research group, Dr. Rasmussen remarks that our comparison drug, midazolam, also had some beneficial effects on PTSD symptom levels. He also noted that the beneficial effects of both ketamine and midazolam might be explained by a placebo effect. Furthermore, Dr. Rasmussen stated that if the extent of dissociative effects of ketamine were found to be related to its mitigating effects on PTSD symptoms, it may be concluded that the reduction in PTSD symptom levels associated with ketamine is due to 'patient expectation of benefit, that is, that ketamine is a better placebo than midazolam.' We would like to point out that while in our study, midazolam was associated with a sizeable reduction (but less pronounced than ketamine) in PTSD severity scores at 24 hours, only 1 patient remained significantly improved 2 weeks after midazolam infusion. In contrast, 7 patients remained improved 2 weeks after ketamine infusion.While it would be interesting to examine our data for a potential correlation between dissociative adverse effects and reduction in PTSD symptom severity, we disagree with Dr Rasmussen on what such a finding might mean. Such correlation, if found, could have several alternative interpretations, eg, that higher plasma levels of ketamine in some patients led to both higher dissociative symptoms and more pronounced PTSD symptom reduction (higher bioavailability) or that a different common cause of higher dissociative symptoms and more pronounced PTSD symptom reduction was at work such as a functional polymorphism in a glutamate receptor gene. As just noted,we do not disagreewith the fact that symptom improvement after administration of any drug can be partially due to a placebo effect, which incidentally has its own underlying neurobiology. Indeed, while randomized clinical trials are required to control for ever-present expectational and other nonspecific effects of treatment, these factors are often optimized in the service of patient care.

The reported incidence of diabetes mellitus among chronic psychiatric patients has varied. A three part study was carried out to determine: the incidence of diabetes among hospitalized psychiatric patients; the relationship of psychotropic drugs and variations in blood sugar levels (BSL); and the correlations between psychopathology and BSL variations. This report deals with the first part of the study in which 249 patients were screened for diabetes with the 2 hour post prandial BSL. Using 120 mg/100 ml as a cut off, 25.70% of the subjects were categorized as having a diabetic condition; of these, 21.15% were previously undetected. The significant differences found were that the above 120 mg group was older, heavier, and had shorter duration of psychiatric illness and current hospitalization than the below 120 mg group. Marked ethnic variability was evident when Negro and Caucasian patients were compared. The elevated BSL was significantly higher in the Negro population; and although they did differ in age and weight from Caucasians, they had significantly shorter durations of illness and current hospitalization. A higher incidence of diabetic conditions among patients treated with psychotropic drugs was evident, but this survey did not permit specific correlations. The diabetic condition in this population was less severe and was more readily controlled by dietary measures than diabetes in the general population. The results indicate that whatever the underlying reasons, the undiagnosed diabetics among psychiatric patients receiving chemotherapy present a new challenge to clinical psychiatrists.",0,"[0.990816593170166, 0.009183374233543873]",0
5915,"Neurocognitive effects of ketamine and association with antidepressant response in individuals with treatment-resistant depression: a randomized controlled trial.^
The glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine displays rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD); however, the potential for adverse neurocognitive effects in this population has not received adequate study. The current study was designed to investigate the delayed neurocognitive impact of ketamine in TRD and examine baseline antidepressant response predictors in the context of a randomized controlled trial. In the current study, 62 patients (mean age = 46.2 ± 12.2) with TRD free of concomitant antidepressant medication underwent neurocognitive assessments using components of the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) before and after a single intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or midazolam (0.045 mg/kg). Participants were randomized to ketamine or midazolam in a 2:1 fashion under double-blind conditions and underwent depression symptom assessments at 24, 48, 72 h, and 7 days post treatment using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Post-treatment neurocognitive assessment was conducted once at 7 days. Neurocognitive performance improved following the treatment regardless of treatment condition. There was no differential effect of treatment on neurocognitive performance and no association with antidepressant response. Slower processing speed at baseline uniquely predicted greater improvement in depression at 24 h following ketamine (t = 2.3, p = 0.027), while controlling for age, depression severity, and performance on other neurocognitive domains. In the current study, we found that ketamine was devoid of adverse neurocognitive effects at 7 days post treatment and that slower baseline processing speed was associated with greater antidepressant response. Future studies are required to further define the neurocognitive profile of ketamine in clinical samples and to identify clinically useful response moderators.",1,"[0.002479753689840436, 0.9975202679634094]",1

Background: Shivering after surgery is one of the common problems following general anesthesia and may lead to multiple complications. This study was performed to find out a suitable alternative for pethidine in prevention of post-anesthetic shivering. Methods: In this randomized Triple-blind prospective study, 160 patients with the age of 20-50 years and ASA class I- II for elective laparascopic cholecystectomy were classified into five equal groups. Anesthesia was induced equivalently for all. Patients were observed in terms of vital signs, side effects and shivering. Results: The four groups were not different regarding age, gender, weight and the physical status class based on the American Society of Anesthesiologists score. Shivering after surgery was observed in 37.596 of patients in the pethidine group, 42.5% of patients in the ketannin group and 40% of patients in the ondansetron group that was significantly lower than the controls 57.5%. Changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and temperature were similar in all four groups. Also the incidence of nausea and vomiting in the ondansetron group was significantly less than other groups (P value <0.05). Discussion: Due to the significant decrease in shivering in the treatment group compared to the control group, and the stability of hemodynamic changes in all groups, with regard to a significant reduction in nausea and vomiting using ondansetron, this drug can be a good alternative to reduce shivering after general anesthesia.",0,"[0.9767647385597229, 0.023235291242599487]",0
750,"Lamina-specific abnormalities of NMDA receptor-associated postsynaptic protein transcripts in the prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.^
The hypothesis of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor hypofunction in schizophrenia was initially based on observations that blockade of the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptor by noncompetitive antagonists, such as phencyclidine and ketamine, can lead to clinical symptoms similar to those present in schizophrenia. Recently, glutamate has also been implicated in the pathophysiology of the mood disorders. As impaired NMDA receptor activity may be the result of a primary defect in the NMDA receptors themselves, or secondary to dysfunction in the protein complexes that mediate their signaling, we measured expression of both NMDA subunits and associated postsynaptic density (PSD) proteins (PSD95, neurofilament-light (NF-L), and SAP102) transcripts in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in subjects with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, and a comparison group using tissue from the Stanley Foundation Neuropathology Consortium. We found decreased NR1 expression in all three illnesses, decreased NR2A in schizophrenia and major depression, and decreased NR2C in schizophrenia. We found no changes of NR2B or NR2D. Receptor autoradiography revealed no alterations in receptor binding in any of the illnesses, indicating no change in total receptor number, but taken with the subunit data suggests abnormal receptor stoichiometry. In the same subjects, PSD95 was unchanged in all three illnesses, while reduced NF-L expression was found in schizophrenia, especially in large cells of layer V. SAP102 expression was reduced in bipolar disorder restricted to small cells of layer II and large cells of layer III in bipolar disorder. These alterations likely reflect altered signaling cascades associated with glutamate-mediated neurotransmission within specific cortical circuits in these psychiatric illnesses. © 2008 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.",0,"[0.9920507073402405, 0.00794927403330803]",0

Ketamine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist with psychotogenic and dissociative effects in healthy humans. These cognitive and perceptual effects in humans are reportedly reduced by benzodiazepine premedication. This study assessed the interactive effects of a ketamine (i.v. bolus of 0.26 mg/kg followed by an infusion of 0.65 mg/kg per hour) and lorazepam 2 mg., PO, in humans. Twenty-three healthy subjects completed 4 test days involving the oral administration of lorazepam or matched placebo 2 h prior to the i.v. infusion of ketamine or placebo. Ketamine: 1) produced behaviors similar to the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia as assessed by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS); 2) evoked perceptual alterations as measured by the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS); 3) impaired performance on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) and other tests sensitive to frontal cortical impairment; and 4) had amnestic effects. Lorazepam produced attention impairments, concrete proverb interpretations, and recall impairments. Lorazepam reduced ketamine-associated emotional distress and there was a non-significant trend for it to decrease perceptual alterations produced by ketamine. However, it failed to reduce many cognitive and behavioral effects of ketamine, including psychosis. Further, lorazepam exacerbated the sedative, attention-impairing, and amnestic effects of ketamine. There was no evidence of pharmacokinetic interaction between these medications. These data suggest that subhypnotic lorazepam and ketamine show a spectrum of interactive effects, ranging from antagonism to potentiation.",1,"[0.0029405243694782257, 0.9970594048500061]",1

9533,"Is off-label repeat prescription of ketamine as a rapid antidepressant safe? Controversies, ethical concerns, and legal implications.^
BACKGROUND: Depressive disorders are a common form of psychiatric illness and cause significant disability. Regulation authorities, the medical profession and the public require high safety standards for antidepressants to protect vulnerable psychiatric patients. Ketamine is a dissociative anaesthetic and a derivative of a hallucinogen (phencyclidine). Its abuse is a major worldwide public health problem. Ketamine is a scheduled drug and its usage is restricted due to its abuse liability. Recent clinical trials have reported that ketamine use led to rapid antidepressant effects in patients suffering from treatment-resistant depression. However, various flaws in study designs, and possible biased reporting of results, may have influenced those findings. Further analyses of ketamine use are needed to ensure patient safety. DISCUSSION: The use of ketamine in research and treatment of depressive disorders is controversial. Recently, mental health professionals raised ethical concerns about an ongoing ketamine trial in the UK. Also, a Canadian agency reviewed the existing evidence and did not recommend prescribing ketamine to treat depressive disorders. Findings obtained from tightly controlled research settings cannot be easily translated to clinical practice as substance abuse is commonly comorbid with depressive disorders. An effective antidepressant should reduce severity of depressive symptoms without liability problems. Although the US FDA has not approved the use of ketamine to treat depressive disorders, some psychiatrists offer off-label repeat prescription of ketamine. Prescribing ketamine for treating depressive disorders requires substantial empirical evidence. Clinicians should also consider research findings on ketamine abuse. Depressive disorders can be chronic conditions and the current evidence does not rule out the risk of substance abuse after repeat prescription of ketamine. Off-label ketamine use in treating depressive disorders may breach ethical and moral standards, especially in countries seriously affected by ketamine abuse. This article presents two real-world clinical vignettes which highlight ethical principles and theories, including autonomy, nonmaleficience, fidelity and consequentialism, as related to off-label ketamine use. CONCLUSION: We urge clinicians to minimise the risk of harming patients by considering the empirical evidence on ketamine properties and attempting all standard antidepressant therapies before considering the off-label use of ketamine.",0,"[0.9888801574707031, 0.011119804345071316]",0

This study describes detailed patterns of comorbidity between Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed. [DSM-IV]; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) drug use disorders and major depression in the United States for 1992. Data were derived from the National Longitudinal Alcohol Epidemiologic Survey (NLAES), a national probability survey consisting of 42,862 respondents, 18-years-old and older, residing in the contiguous United States. The sampling design included oversampling of Blacks and young adults (18-29 years old). Comorbidity rates and associations between DSM-IV drug use disorders (i.e., prescription drugs, sedatives, tranquilizers, amphetamines, cannabis, cocaine, and hallucinogens) and major depression were expressed as odds ratios with confidence intervals adjusted for the complex design characteristics of the NLAES. Comorbidity analyses were presented by gender, ethnicity, and age for past-year, prior-to-past-year, and lifetime diagnoses. The results showed that virtually all odds ratios were significantly greater than 1, demonstrating that comorbidity of a variety of drug use disorders and major depression is pervasive in the general population. Diagnostic and subgroup variations in comorbidity were noted. As expected, the association between drug dependence and major depression was greater than the association between abuse and major depression. The association between abuse and major depression was greater for women than men for prescription drugs, sedatives, tranquilizers, and amphetamines, but not for cocaine or hallucinogens. Men generally demonstrated stronger relations between drug dependence and major depression. Implications of the results are discussed in terms of professional help seeking, the self-medication hypothesis, and differential social-control theory.",0,"[0.9894589185714722, 0.010541086085140705]",0

Aims: It still remains unclear whether psychopathological abnormalities described in human 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine users (MDMA users) and d-amphetamine users (AMPH users) existed before the beginning of regular use or if they develop with ongoing use. Objectives: The present study was conducted in order to assess this relationship and to overcome previous methodological shortcomings. Methods: A longitudinal cohort study in 96 beginning MDMA and d-amphetamine users between 2006 and 2011 with a follow-up duration of 24 months. In order to explore the impact of MDMA and AMPH use on self-reported psychopathology (measured by the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised), mixed models for repeated measures were fitted. In order to examine the impact of previous psychopathology on subsequent use, partial correlation analyses and linear regression analyses were applied. Results: Over the course of the 2-year follow-up period, 31 subjects used neither MDMA nor AMPH (non-users); 65 subjects used both MDMA and AMPH: 37 subjects used between 1 and 14 tablets of MDMA and 28 subjects used 15 or more tablets of MDMA. Thirty-three subjects used between 1 and 14 g of AMPH, and 32 subjects used 15 g or more. No associations concerning MDMA/AMPH use and development of self-reported psychopathology were found.

7233,"LITERATURE REVIEW: THE EFFECTS OF LSD AND PSILOCYBIN MICRODOSING.^
The consumption of small doses of psychedelic substances without causing sensory and visual changes is known as microdosing, which has become popular in recent years as an alternative treatment for psychiatric disorders and for providing beneficial cognitive effects. Among psychedelics, LSD and psilocybin are the most used substances in microdosing and have structural similarity with the neurotransmitter serotonin, acting as agonists in serotonin receptors. Therefore, the objective of the present study is to carry out a quantitative review to verify the use of LSD and psilocybin microdosing through studies found in SciELO, PubMed and CAPES Journals databases. Some of the effects reported by individuals when using microdosing include the reduction of depression and anxiety symptoms, improvement in cognitive performance, productivity and focus, in addition to facilitating creativity. Preliminary results have already shown the possible efficacy of microdosing as a therapeutic treatment but future clinical studies, mainly with the use of placebo, needs to be carried out to analyze possible adverse effects, differences between substances, schedule and other conditions of exposure to psychedelics.",0,"[0.9738982319831848, 0.026101745665073395]",0
7477,"High-dose ketamine infusion for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder in combat veterans.^
INTRODUCTION: Combat veterans are at high risk for the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use disorders. Ketamine has been shown to be an effective treatment for numerous mental health disorders, although research on its efficacy in combat-related PTSD in veterans is very limited. METHODS: The study population consisted of 30 US military veterans with combat-related PTSD. Participants underwent a standard induction series of six 1-hour ketamine infusions with the goal of obtaining a transpersonal dissociative experience. Participants were given a series of self-report questionnaires to assess for changes in symptoms of depression, PTSD, and substance use prior to the first and sixth infusions. RESULTS: Symptoms of depression as measured by change in score on the Patient Health Questionnaire decreased significantly from an average of 18.9 to 9.5 (P < .001). Similarly, symptoms of PTSD as measured by change in score on the PSTD Checklist for DSM-5 dropped significantly from an average of 56.2 to 31.3 (P < .001). Self-reported levels of substance use did not significantly decrease during the study period, although the level of use trended down. CONCLUSIONS: This observational study suggests that high-dose ketamine infusion therapy, which induced a transpersonal dissociative experience, could be a valuable tool in the treatment of combat-related PTSD. Further study is needed to better elucidate ketamine's mechanism of action with regards to the treatment of PTSD.",1,"[0.0031427210196852684, 0.9968572854995728]",1
5675,"Everolimus induced mood changes in breast cancer patients: a case-control study.^
Introduction The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway plays a critical role in cancer cell growth, proliferation and angiogenesis, but also in brain homeostasis and the pathophysiology of mood disorders. The impact of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus on the mood of breast cancer patients is unknown. Materials and methods Consecutive, post-menopausal metastatic breast cancer patients receiving hormone therapy +/- everolimus were prospectively followed-up using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the MADRS (Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale) questionnaires. Results Post hoc tests comparing everolimus + hormonotherapy to hormonotherapy alone demonstrated a significant effect of everolimus after 6 weeks of treatment on BDI scores (t(1,38) = -2.0716, p < 0.05), and after 3 weeks (t(1,38) = -3.9165, p < 0.001) and 6 weeks of treatment (t(1,38) = -2.0373, p < 0.05) on MADRS scores. Analysis within each treatment group showed that the effect of time since treatment initiation on BDI and MADRS scores was specifically observed in the everolimus + hormonotherapy group (F(2,34) = 11.875, p < 0.001 and F(2,34) = 7.820, p < 0.01 respectively), but not in the hormonotherapy alone group (F(2.34) = 1.671, p > 0.2 and F(2,34) = 0.830, p > 0.2 respectively). Conclusions The mTOR inhibitor everolimus induces significant mood alterations in breast cancer patients. The evaluation of psychiatric symptoms is not only mandatory in the context of phase 1, dose-finding studies of PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors, but is also clinically relevant in daily practice.",0,"[0.9821692109107971, 0.01783074252307415]",0
2748,"Further observations on primary modes of perception: The Use of a Masking Technique for Subliminal Visual Stimulation.^
1. This study had as its purpose the validational testing of an observation of Urbantschitsch; namely, that a visual stimulus rendered invisible by covering it with sheets of paper still registered through the paper upon the perceptual apparatus. hlethodology was based upon the possible recovery of transformations of this stimulus through the images of a group of subjects. Experimental controls, an a priot-i system of quantification, statistical applications, and ‘blind’ scorers were part of the experimental design. The results supported this hypothesis of Urbantschitsch to a significant degree. 2. A subsidiary hypothesis, that the use of an ‘ego-impairing’ drug (LSD-25) in subhallucinatory doses would increase the degree of delivery of percepts into subsequent imagery, was also tested and confirmed. The research techniques for tliis corollary experiment were the same as for the main study and used part of its research sample. 3. Experimental images under LSD showed certain qualitative differences from those obtained in the main experiment. These differences were an increase in color, light, and inanimate movements, and a decrease in the importance of the shapes of the image objects. It was speculated that these findings indicate the presence of an archaic level of perception that might precede the developmental pliase dominated by primary-process transformations. In this archaic stage, visual perception would be Gestalt-free and dominated by color, light, and movement sensations. 4. Note was taken of certain similarities between the Urbantschitsch phenomenon and certain parapsychological findings. A review of the literature devoted to the psi-phenomenon led to the interpretation that some of the results claimed for parapsychology may be based, instead, upon subliminal registration. 5. Individual differences in degree of utilization of subliminal stimuli were noted. The need for studies of individual differences was stressed. The markedly enhanced delivery of the subliminal stimulus following ingestion of LSD was interpreted as indicating that regression of the ego's perceptual apparatus is related to such increased utilization. © 1960, SAGE Publications.

3524,"Simultaneous determination of amphetamine, methamphetamine, methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), and methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA) enantiomers by GC-MS.^
A method is described for the simultaneous determination of the ratio of l- and d-enantiomers of amphetamine, methamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), and 3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA) in urine. The assay uses liquid-liquid extraction followed by derivatization with trifluoroacetyl-l-prolyl chloride (l-TPC) and analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The assay was developed using prepared samples containing varying concentrations of each of the analytes over a range of percentages of each enantiomer. Results showed the method to provide accurate and reliable results in samples containing > or = 10 ng/mL amphetamine and methamphetamine and > or = 25 ng/mL MDA, MDMA, and MDEA. The assay was used to analyze urine samples from subjects of a controlled MDMA study. Results for each of the eight subjects showed a greater percentage of the l-enantiomer of MDMA initially, and the percentage increased with time postdose. Analysis of the metabolite MDA revealed that the proportion of d-enantiomer was initially greater than the l-enantiomer followed by a gradual increase in the proportion of l-enantiomer until it exceeded the amount of the d-enantiomer. In all cases, the l-MDA exceeded the d-MDA within the first 36 h postdose.",1,"[0.0033984575420618057, 0.9966014623641968]",1
3063,"Improvement in Depression Symptoms Measured by Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale and Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Rated Items after Randomised Double-blind COMP360 Psilocybin Therapy for Treatment-resistant Depression.^
Introduction: COMP360 is a synthetic, proprietary, purified form of psilocybin in development for treatment‐resistant depression (TRD) with FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation. In a recent phase IIb study, COMP360 psilocybin 25mg was superior to 1mg on change from baseline (CFB) to Week 3 on the MontgomeryÅsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score (primary efficacy endpoint), when administered alongside psychological support. Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology‐Self Rated (QIDS‐SR16) total score (exploratory efficacy endpoint) showed similar results. Objectives: To analyse changes in specific depression symptoms after psilocybin treatment in the aforementioned study, as measured by individual item scores on the MADRS and QIDS‐SR16 (range 0‐6 and 0‐3). Methods: Participants with TRD were randomised to single doses of psilocybin 25mg (n=79), 10mg (n=75), or 1mg (n=79). A remote, blinded rater assessed the MADRS at Baseline, Day 2 (the day post‐psilocybin), and Weeks 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12. The QIDS‐SR16 was self‐rated at Baseline, Day 1, Day 2, and Weeks 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12. At each time point, descriptive statistics were calculated for each MADRS and QIDS‐SR16 individual item score. Results: At Week 3, MADRS items with the largest differences in mean CFB in the 25mg arm were Inability to Feel, Apparent Sadness, Lassitude, and Reported Sadness. Greater improvement in the 25mg arm was apparent from Day 2 and remained to Week 12 (Lassitude remained to Week 6 only). On the QIDS‐SR16, the item with the largest difference in mean CFB at Week 3 in the 25mg arm was in Feeling Sad and remained evident to Week 12 (Table 1). Conclusions: A single administration of COMP360 psilocybin therapy rapidly and dose‐relatedly improved symptoms of depressed mood and anhedonia ‐ the two key symptoms of depression. As anhedonia is predictive of poorer treatment response, and improvements in anhedonia correlate with improvements in functioning, it is important to understand the impact of treatments on this symptom.",1,"[0.002623568754643202, 0.9973764419555664]",1
8991,"Scaling Up: Multisite Open-Label Clinical Trials of MDMA-Assisted Therapy for Severe Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.^
Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating mental health condition associated with serious adverse health outcomes and functional impairment. Previous MDMA-assisted therapy (MDMA-AT) studies have shown promising results in single site studies. Two open-label studies tested this modality in multisite clinical trials to assess the feasibility of scaling this manualized therapy across 14 North American sites. Method: Cotherapist dyads were trained in the manualized MDMA-AT protocol and administered three experimental sessions 3 to 5 weeks apart among participants with severe PTSD. Cotherapist dyads were provided clinical supervision and evaluated for protocol adherence by centralized raters. Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) assessed change in symptoms severity. Results: Adherence rating scores were high across cotherapist dyads (M = 95.08%, SD = 3.70%) and sites (M = 95.23%, SD = 2.20%). CAPS-5 scores decreased following 3 MDMA-AT sessions at 18 weeks post baseline (Delta M = -29.99, Delta SD = 13.45, p < .0001, n = 37, Cohen's d = 2.2, confidence interval [1.97, 2.47]).

3780,"MDMA enhances ""mind reading"" of positive emotions and impairs ""mind reading"" of negative emotions.^
RATIONALE: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) increases sociability. The prosocial effects of MDMA may result from the release of the ""social hormone"" oxytocin and associated alterations in the processing of socioemotional stimuli. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the effects of MDMA (125 mg) on the ability to infer the mental states of others from social cues of the eye region in the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test. The study included 48 healthy volunteers (24 men, 24 women) and used a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects design. A choice reaction time test was used to exclude impairments in psychomotor function. We also measured circulating oxytocin and cortisol levels and subjective drug effects. RESULTS: MDMA differentially affected mind reading depending on the emotional valence of the stimuli. MDMA enhanced the accuracy of mental state decoding for positive stimuli (e.g., friendly), impaired mind reading for negative stimuli (e.g., hostile), and had no effect on mind reading for neutral stimuli (e.g., reflective). MDMA did not affect psychomotor performance, increased circulating oxytocin and cortisol levels, and produced subjective prosocial effects, including feelings of being more open, talkative, and closer to others. CONCLUSIONS: The shift in the ability to correctly read socioemotional information toward stimuli associated with positive emotional valence, together with the prosocial feelings elicited by MDMA, may enhance social approach behavior and sociability when MDMA is used recreationally and facilitate therapeutic relationships in MDMA-assisted psychotherapeutic settings.",1,"[0.0025753385853022337, 0.9974247217178345]",1

Wastewater-based epidemiology is a well-established and complementary approach for monitoring illicit drug use in the general population. In this study, amphetamine (AMP), methamphetamine (METH), 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), cocaine (COC) (from benzoylecgonine), and cannabis (from THC-COOH) consumption levels were investigated for the first time in Turkey (Istanbul). A solid-phase extraction method was applied to influent wastewater samples collected from two districts, Beyoglu and Catalca. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis was conducted with electrospray ionization in positive mode. Calibration curves were acquired in linear form with >0.999 correlation coefficients. Limit of detection levels were measured as 0.91–151 ng/L, and limit of quantitation levels were in the range of 3 to 500 ng/L. Solid-phase extraction recovery and repeatability experiments were achieved by spiking the mix solution to different concentrations (50, 250, 750 ng/L) in 50 mL tap water and wastewater (500, 1000 ng/L) samples in six replicates. The method was optimized, and recoveries were found to be over 80% for all six substances with up to 11.9% relative standard deviation. According to the real sample results, cannabis was found to be the most abused illicit substance among the analytes.

6297,"Grouping Immune-modulation With Cryoablation (LOGIC) for Breast Cancers.^
AIMS: The main goal of proposed study is to assess synergy of tumor cryoablation and immune checkpoint inhibitor in highâ€risk breast cancer in humans. This will be achieved by comparing cryoablation alone and cryoablation in combination with pembrolizumab â€ a [checkpoint inhibitor (anti PDâ€1/PDâ€L1 antibody) currently FDA approved as cancer therapy] with the current standard of care including surgical resection. The current standard of neoadjuvant/ adjuvant therapies will remain unchanged for ethical reasons of providing bestâ€known standard of care to all patients. OBJECTIVES: We propose a prospective randomized exploratory trial where patients with clinical stage I/II, triple negative invasive breast cancer will be randomized to one of the three arms of the study: 1. Standard of care â€ neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgical resection followed by appropriate adjuvant therapy as needed. 2. Cryoablation arm â€ cryoablation followed by appropriate neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgical resection followed by appropriate adjuvant therapy as needed. 3. Cryoablation with Pembrolizumab â€ Single dose of Pembrolizumab of 200 mg before (within 24â€48 hours) of cryoablation followed by appropriate neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgical resection followed by appropriate adjuvant therapy as needed. Outcome measures will include blood and tumor analysis of immune response with flow cytometry and cytokine analysis at baseline, after intervention, and before surgery. Tissue from core biopsy at baseline, repeat biopsy before chemotherapy and tumor resection will also be analyzed for tumor microenvironment. INTRODUCTION / BACKGROUND / SIGNIFICANCE: High Risk Breast Cancer and Need for Newer Treatment Approaches: Tripleâ€ negative breast cancer, which represent 15â€20% of all breast cancer diagnoses are considered highâ€risk. While surgical resection remains the mainstay of treatment, therapeutic backbone includes neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy. For patients who continue to have significant residual disease even after surgical resection and completion of chemotherapy, further aggressive systemic therapies such as capecitabine are performed. Tripleâ€negative subtype is associated with the highest number of mutations across the genome and nonâ€metastatic disease is associated with 17â€20% local failure and 35â€ 40% distant failure at 5â€10 years of follow up. These data suggest that micrometastatic hematogenous spread happens in a substantial number of patients with operable highâ€risk breast cancer and newer approaches are required that potentiate local control while simultaneously controlling the systemic spread of disease. Scope of Immuneâ€modulation: Cancer immunotherapy has experienced extraordinary success in recent decades. Antigens that can evoke antiâ€tumor immune responses form a suitable immunotherapeutic target. The approach of T cell checkpoint blockade therapies has shown remarkable clinical responses in several types of solid cancers such as, melanoma, nonâ€small cell lung cancer, bladder cancer and mismatch repairâ€ deficient cancers. An effective antiâ€tumor immune response is thought to be initiated by the taking up of tumor antigens by antigenâ€ presenting cells (APCs), which is turn present them, and provide coâ€stimulatory signals to both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. APCs, particularly dendritic cells, process antigens through an exogenous antigen processing pathway where tumor cell material is phagocytosed and converted into HLA class I and class II binding peptides that are presented to CD8+ (crossâ€presentation) and CD4+ T cells, respectively. Utilizing this knowledge, recent phase 1 trials have reported enhanced response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in combination with conventional chemotherapy in tripleâ€negative breast cancers. Certainly, percentage of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) has been identified as an important immunologic parameter, particularly for highâ€risk breast cancers, that correlates with response to systemic therapy, suggesting a stron role of host immune response in cancer control irrespective of therapeutic intervention. Limitation of Immuneâ€modulation â€ T cells are key players in antiâ€tumor immunity and therefore form the major target for immunotherapeutic research. The current breakthrough in cancer immunotherapy results from the identification and targeting of checkpoint mechanism involving CTLAâ€4, PDâ€1, and PDâ€L1. CTLAâ€4 and PDâ€1 are coâ€inhibitory receptors found on the surface of T cells. Upon binding to their corresponding ligands (CD 80/86 and PDâ€L1/L2, respectively), T cells become anergic â€ a physiologic mechanism of tolerance. In the context of tumor microenvironment, the aberrant expression along with chronic exposure to tumor antigens can lead to undesirable suppression of T cell immunity. Recently developed checkpoint blockers, such as PDâ€1/ PDâ€L1 inhibitor, pembrolizumab, has provide a new weapon against cancer with durable clinical responses and longâ€term remissions. However, checkpoint blockade has been shown to be most effective in tumors with high mutation burden, in line with the notion that T cell recognition of neoâ€antigens plays a major role in checkpoint blockade. Many studies show that when the tumorâ€reactive T cell infiltrate is absent or low (low percentage of TILs), the substrate for checkpoint blockade is lacking. Additionally, majority of patients with so called hyperâ€mutated tumors do not respond to checkpoint blockade due to immuneâ€editing, which compromises the T cells' ability to fulfill their cytotoxic activity of adequate tumor infiltration and recognition of tumorâ€antigenâ€loaded HLA class I molecules. Therefore enhancing antigen presentation within the tumor is essential for checkpoint blockade to be effective. Role of Ablative Therapies â€ Particularly Cryoablation: Thermal ablation with cryotherapy, laser, radiofrequency, microwave, and focused ultrasound present a unique opportunity to address both, the primary tumor and the micrometastatic disease. The effects of tumor ablation are multifold: (1) the destruction of tumor mass, lowering tumor burden and (2) the release of tumor antigens, making them available for uptake by antigen presenting cells (APCs) and the treatment itself leads to (3) the release of damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and (4) the induction of a physiological wound healing response. Ablation leads to creation of an in situ antigen depot containing all types of tumor protein, which leads to initiation of systemic antiâ€tumor immune response that can potentially eliminate occult metastatic disease. Ablation of tumors at temperatures above 65 Â°C leads to denaturation of proteins. This can affect immune responses in opposing ways as high temperatures denature immune activating signals, such as danger signals like heat shock proteins (HSPs). Therefore cryoablation is the most promising ablative technique, as it offers minimal invasiveness, less damage to surrounding tissues, and better preservation of tumor antigens, and most robust data on immune stimulation. Immune Stimulation Effected by Cryoablation â€ Deep freezing and thawing during cryoablation induces necrosis and the upâ€regulation of DAMP molecules that render tumor cells more susceptible to APCs and tumor specific Tâ€cellâ€mediated killing. Cryoablation upregulates DAMPs, such as HMG1, calreticulin, S100A8/A9 and HSP70, which stimulate the immune system through Receptor for Advanced Glycosylation Endâ€products (RAGE) and tollâ€like receptors and enhance antigen presentation. Additionally, the central zone cytokine milieu resulting from cryoablation is typically a Th1 cytokine profile of ILâ€2, INFâ€Î³, TNFâ€Î±, and ILâ€12.28 These cytokines and DAMPs presumably drive the cytotoxic CD8+ Tâ€cell response. Preclinical evidence supporting immune response of cryoablation: Several preclinical studies on cryoimmunology explored whether freezing the tumor and leaving it in situ would render the animal resistant to a reâ€challenge. Animal models utilizing carcinoma and sarcoma c ll lines in rabbits and mice demonstrated tumorâ€ specific resistance to reâ€challenge. Reâ€challenge with same tumor cell lines showed resistance to growth in animals after cryoablation compared to surgical resection. Similar experience was reported by Blackwood and Cooper with models involving rats inoculated with myosarcoma and carcinosarcoma cell lines. Rats with cryoablated tumors were more likely to resist reâ€challenge, and demonstrated regression of secondary tumors compared to surgically treated rats. Bagley et al. compared cryoablation with surgery in using MCAâ€10 fibrosarcoma in C57BL/6 mice, harvesting splenic lymphocytes at weekly intervals after treatment for cytotoxicity assays. Mice undergoing cryoablation had significantly higher cytotoxicity than surgically treated or untreated mice. Sabel et al. studied MTâ€901 mammary adenocarcinoma tumors in BALB/c mice treated with cryoablation or surgical resection. After reâ€challenge, 86% of mice treated with surgery developed second tumors compared with 16% of mice treated with cryoablation. This was tumorâ€ specific, as the cryoablation offered no protection against challenge with other cell lines. More recently, Kim et al. utilizing renal cell carcinoma cell lines in BALB/c mice reported similar results. More recently, abscopal effect of tumor regression in untreated tumors in animal models where only one of the implanted tumors was cryoablated, has been reported as a result of systemic immune response. Clinical evidence supporting immune response of cryoablation: Although clinical use of cryoablation for cancer has recently expanded, there are relatively few studies examining the immunological impact in humans. Ravindranath et al. measured the level of serum tumor gangliosides and their antibody titers in patients receiving cryoablation, radiofrequency ablation or resection of liver metastasis from colorectal cancer. Serum ganglioside levels were significantly higher in cryoablated patients compared to radiofrequency or surgery. Cryoablated patients also demonstrated higher titers of IgM against tumor gangliosides. Si et al. studied 20 patients with prostate cancer undergoing cryoablation of primary tumor and reported an increase in in cytolytic activity against LNCaP, and an increase in number of IFNâ€É£ producing T cells. Thakur et al. conducted a pilot study of cryoablation and GMâ€SCF for patients with renal cell carcinoma metastatic to lung. GMâ€CSF was infiltrated near a lung metastatic lesion selected for cryoablation. Additional GMâ€CSF therapy was used postâ€procedure. The combination of GMâ€CSF and cryoablation produced an enhanced immune response in terms of cytotoxicity and serum antibodies. Limitation of Cryoablation: Despite the data reviewed above, immune response to cryoablation has not been uniform. Some preclinical studies on osteogenic sarcoma, and prostate cancer models, failed to show any increase in immune function after cryoablation. More importantly, several studies have reported immune suppression with cryosurgery. The majority of these studies involved fibrosarcoma cell lines in rats and showed decreased resistance to reâ€challenge after cryoablation, as well increased growth of metastatic tumors and secondary tumors. From a breast cancer perspective, Sabel et al. reported that a high freeze rate resulted in increased tumorâ€specific Tâ€cells in the tumor draining lymph nodes, reduction in lung metastasis and improved survival compared to low freeze rates which also had more Tregs (CD3,CD4,CD127â€,CD25+). Therefore, the magnitude of systemic effect induced by cryotherapy alone has proven to be either insufficient or counterâ€productive. Current understanding is that close to the ablative source, direct injury and cell death with necrosis releases tumor antigens and (DAMPs) which recruit and activate dendritic cells that in turn stimulate proliferation of T cells and immune components. Transition zone away from the ablative source causes indirect cellular injury and apoptotic cell death without release of DAMPs, wh ch causes release of suppressive cytokines and Tâ€cell clonal deletion and anergy. Intuitively, cryoablation stimulates an immune response but the ultimate clinical impact is dictated by the ratio of CD4+ Tâ€effector cells to Tâ€regulatory cells. Higher Tâ€effector to Tâ€regulatory cell ratio promotes the more favorable CD8 cytotoxic T cell response. While CD8+ cytotoxic cells eliminate the primary tumor and systemic micrometastasis, it is important that anergy is kept in check and both effector (CD45RO+, CCR7â€) and central (CCR7+, CD45RO+) memory Tâ€cells are established for longâ€term protective antiâ€ tumor immunity. HYPOTHESIS: ""Combination of cryoablation with Pembrolizumab for local control in highâ€risk triple negative breast cancer is superior to surgical resection alone or cryoablation alone in generating antitumor immune response"". METHODS: Site of Study: Proposed exploratory work is a randomized trial that will be conducted at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Centerâ€Breast Center of Excellence, UMC Cancer Center. Type of study: Prospective Randomized Trial â€ hypothesis driven Experimental Design: We propose a single blinded prospective randomized trial, where women with Stage I/II triple negative breast cancer will be enrolled in one of the three arms in 1:1:1 randomized fashion: (I) Control arm with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by lumpectomy/mastectomy with sentinel node biopsy +/â€ axillary dissection; (II) Intervention with cryoablation alone followed by neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by lumpectomy/mastectomy with sentinel node biopsy +/â€ axillary dissection; (III) Intervention with cryoablation + Pembrolizumab followed by neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by lumpectomy/mastectomy with sentinel node biopsy +/â€ axillary dissection. The treatment schedule is designed to optimize antigen exposure time [Figureâ€2]. The trial will be registered at the National Clinical Trials Network once IRB approval is obtained. Subjects: All patients 18 and older with clinical stage I/II triple negative disease will be offered to participate. These patients will be screened during an oncology/surgery appointment by the study team. A computerized randomization list will be used for treatment arm assignment using the website: https://www.sealedenvelope.com/simpleâ€randomiser/v1/lists Inclusion Criteria: â€ Females â€ Stage I/II Cancer â€ Age range 18 â€ 89 years â€ Diagnoses: Invasive carcinoma, ER â€, PRâ€, HER2â€ (triple negative) â€ Radiology findings: Unifocal disease visible on ultrasound Exclusion Criteria: â€ Additional primary cancer â€ Inflammatory breast cancer â€ History of autoimmune disease â€ History of chronic immunosuppression â€ Prior immunotherapy â€ Recent vaccination (within 4 wks.) â€ Prior radiation therapy â€ Prior investigational agent therapy within last 1 year â€ Pregnancy at the time of diagnosis and/ or treatment â€ Breast feeding Study visits: Informed consent will be obtained then the patient will be randomized. All visit will coincide with standard of care visits. Next, the following will occur: Visit 1: Day 1: Baseline Blood draw; up to 20ml will be collected in EDTA tubes; the blood will be centrifuged at TTUHSC. Plasma will be used for cytokine analysis and phenotyping at TTU lab. One EDTA tube will be sent to University of Houston (throughout the study timeâ€points). Following outcomes will be measured: Cytokine analysis â€ RNA seq PBMC analysis Baseline core biopsy tissue (already available from diagnostic workup) will be evaluated for: (2 unstained slides will be prepared for RNA seq from fixed tissue) â€ TIL % â€ RNA Seq tumor tissue Visit 2 (Group II & III Only) After Cryoablation: Day 3 (+/â€ 7 days): Postâ€ablation blood draw (Group II & III)â€ up to 10ml of blood in EDTA tube(s): â€¢ Cytokine analysis Visit 3 (All groups) Pre Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy: Day 21 (+/â€ 14 days): Blood draw at the time of port insertion for chemotherapyâ€ up to 20ml of blood in EDTA tubes: â€ Immune phenotyping by flow cytometry â€ Cytokine anal sis â€ RNA seq PBMC analysis â€ Tumor biopsy will be repeated for TIL and RNA seq analysis Visit 4 (All groups): Post Chemotherapy Resection (approximately 6 months after original biopsy): Preoperative blood drawâ€ up to 20ml blood in EDTA tubes (similar to baseline): â€ Immune phenotyping by flow cytometry â€ Cytokine analysis â€ RNA seq PBMC analysis Surgical specimen tissue analysis (2 unstained slides from fixed tissues will be prepared for RNA seq) â€ TIL% â€ RNA seq tumor tissue Sample Size: Tumorâ€infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), particularly in the stroma of triple negative breast cancer are prognostic and predictive of response to therapy. Therefore, recommendations by the International TILs Working Group were used to calculate the sample size for this project. The percentage change of TILs is assumed to be 10% for the control arm and 50% for the treatment arm. A sample of 10 patients per group can achieve 80% power to detect a mean difference of 0.4 (0.5 vs. 0.1) with a standard deviation of 0.3, using a twoâ€sided twoâ€sample equal variance tâ€test (alpha=0.05). Assuming 30% drop out rate, a total of 12 patients in each arm would suffice for a total of 36 patients; this would achieve a 90% power. This means that a minimum of 10 patients per arm and a maximum of 12 patients per arm will lead to a statistically meaningful study. Statistical Plan: Descriptive statistics will be used to compute the ranges, means, and variances for the independent variables standard care, cryo, cryo+pembro. This will suggest that the concentration of the observations around the mean, and variation of the observations from the means. The normality test will be considered to check whether or not data follow normal distribution. Normal quantileâ€quantile plots (also called qâ€q plots) will be utilized to determine if data sets come from a normal population. To detect the outliers (if there is any) several statistical measures will be taken into consideration. To check the homogeneity of variances for the independent variables standard care, cryo, cryo+pembro, Levene's test will be performed by setting up null and alternative hypotheses. To compare the significance difference among the means of the variables, a oneâ€way analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be performed. The null and alternative hypotheses for the means will be introduced. In ANOVA, statistical significance of the means will be tested (Î± = 0.05) by using the Fâ€test statistic. If the means are found statistical significant difference then the postâ€hoc multiple comparisons tests will be performed. Postâ€hoc multiple comparisons tests (LSD, Bonferroni, Scheffe, Tukey, etc.) will be utilized to detect the appropriate significant group means. If the samples do not meet the normality assumptions then several nonâ€parametric tests will be considered for the statistical analyses. Tumor Cryoablation: All registered patients will be randomized to one of the three arms of the study. Patients in arm II and III will receive cryoablation according to the following protocol (similar to the protocol used in ACOSOG Z1072 trial). Cryoablation Device: Cryoablation will be performed using the commercially available ProSense Cryosurgical System (IceCure Medical Ltd, Caesarea, Israel) consisting of a console, cryoprobe and associated liquid nitrogen (cryogen) Case Dewars. The console is a selfâ€contained unit that features an interface for controlling and monitoring the cryoablation procedure. It operates with standard 120 VAC (60Hz) power. Device Operation: The ProSense Cryosurgical System uses a closed system to circulate liquid nitrogen within the cryoprobe tip creating subâ€freezing temperatures that result in ablation of target tissue. The lesion is identified with ultrasound and the cryoprobe is placed in the center of the lesion under ultrasound guidance after adequate local anesthesia, and ablation is carried out according to predetermined freezeâ€thawâ€freeze algorithm. The probe is then warmed by an internal electrical resistance heater and removed from the p tient. Cryoablation Procedure: Tumor is identified using highâ€resolution linear array ultrasound probe in two orthogonal views. Longest dimension of the tumor is identified for parallel insertion of the probe. This dimension is entered into the console; the console provides the length of cryoprobe tip to be past the lesion upon insertion. After insertion, the probe position is confirmed in two orthogonal views. Cryoablation is done using the freezeâ€thawâ€freeze cycle according to the tumor size. Entire procedure is monitored under vision and saline is infiltrated to avoid skin frostbite by hydroâ€ dissecting the skin away from the iceâ€ball. Size of iceâ€ball is recorded in orthogonal dimensions. In our protocol, if a patient has more than one lesions, only one lesion will be ablated; however biopsies from other lesions will be studied for abscopal affect. Infusion of Pembrolizumab and Dosing: As an initial step, we confirmed the safety and tolerability of immune checkpoint inhibitors with tumor cryoablation in women with newly diagnosed breast cancer. One important consideration was selection of an immune modulating antibody. Pembrolizumab, an FDAâ€approved antibody against PDâ€1/PDâ€L1, has a wellâ€established safety profile, and induces longâ€term remissions lasting >10 years in 10â€20% of advanced melanoma patients.50 Furthermore, because T cells acutely upregulate expression of PDâ€1/PDâ€L1 after being exposed to antigens,51 which in turn may blunt the cytotoxic response, pembrolizumab is ideally suited for immune modulation in combination with cryoablation. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) published a pilot study on this combination; no serious side effects attributable to ipilimumab were reported; no surgery was delayed. MSKCC used 10 mg/Kg as a single dose; however, since the studies report higher adverse events at that dose, we propose the recommended 200 mg for IV over 90 minutes dose before cryoablation, which is the currently utilized dose in clinical setting for triple negative cancers. Methodology for Outcome Measures: We will observe and monitor the immune response(s) following the cryoablation procedures with and without the pembrolizumab. Blood samples will be collected in EDTAâ€blood collection tubes and then aliquoted for Tâ€cell phenotypic analysis, and plasma collection for cytokine/chemokine, and for RNA seq analysis, at the indicated time points. Pathology slides will be made for research from core biopsy samples at baseline and from lumpectomy and sentinel nodes at the time of surgery. Five slides will be made per specimen (after completion of routine pathology) for H&E and immunohistochemistry for immune cell infiltrates to calculate TILs percentage. All collaborators/Key personnel involved in performing the outcome measure analysis will be blinded to the randomization groups. Following are the details for outcome analysis: TIL Calculation: All tissue specimens that undergo routine pathology reporting will be evaluated for TIL reporting according to guidelines put forth by the International TILs Working Group. Change in TIL score between original core biopsy tissue and surgical tissue will be the focus of analysis to assess the impact of proposed interventions. Measurement of Tâ€cell Changes in Blood: Tâ€cell subtypes can be defined by differential expression of cell surface markers. We will monitor Tâ€cells for activation, increased CD8+ effector Tâ€cells and development of effector and central memory. For Tâ€cell phenotyping, whole blood staining (100 Âµl/stain) will be performed with antibodies to CD3, CD4, CD8, CD25, CD27, CD45RO, CD127, CD137, ICOS, CCR7 and Ki67 with appropriate isotype controls.55 Following RBC lysis, the stained mononuclear cells will be run on an Attune NxT 14â€color flow cytometer (Thermofisher, Waltham, MA) and analyzed using FlowJo software (Becton, Dickinson and Company). Tâ€cells (CD3+, CD4+ or CD8+) will be analyzed for changes in naÃ¯ve (CD27+, CCR7+, CD45ROâ€), effector (CCR7â€, CD45ROâ€), effector memory (CD27â€, CCR7â€ ,CD45RO+) and central memory (CD27+, CCR7+, CD45RO+) phenotypic markers as well as for activation (ICOS and CD137) and proliferation (Ki67). We will further analyze for percentages of Tâ€regulatory cells (CD25+, CD127â€). We will use this data to determine a Tâ€cell immune signature to correlate the effectiveness of the cryoabalation+/â€ Pembrolizumab to predict the longâ€term antiâ€tumor immunity. Plasma Cytokine/Chemokine Analysis: Our initial analysis will be to determine which cytokines/chemokines and what concentrations are detected in the blood following cryoablation +/â€ pembrolizumab and how their profiles are altered. We will focus on the inflammatory and helper Tâ€cell cytokine profiles and how these cytokines influence and direct the Tâ€cell response. Additionally, we will look at changes in chemokines. Their altered expression in malignancies have been shown to dictate leukocyte recruitment and activation, angiogenesis, cancer cell proliferation, and metastasis in all the stages of the disease.56 At baseline, 24â€48 hours post ablation, between pre chemotherapy, blood will be collected and plasma isolated by centrifuging 1â€2 mls of blood at 1â€2000 x g for 10 minutes and then aliquoting 120 Âµl into 0.65 mL microcentrifuge tubes. Standard of care group will only have 3 blood sample time points. Plasma samples will be analyzed with a Bioâ€Plex 200 at Eve Technologies Corporation (Calgary, AB Canada) using the Human High Sensitivity Tâ€Cell Discovery Array 14â€plex (HDHSTC14): GMâ€CSF, IFNy, ILâ€1B, ILâ€2, ILâ€4, ILâ€5, ILâ€6, ILâ€8, ILâ€10, ILâ€12p70, ILâ€13, ILâ€17A, ILâ€23, TNFâ€a. DATA SHEET: See Excel spreadsheet. The RNA seq will be collected as heat maps for differentially expressed genes. RISKS: Blood draw risks: The risks of a blood draw include: pain, discomfort, bleeding, bruising, redness, infection where the needle enters the skin; feeling lightheaded, fainting. Cryoablation related risks: Cryoablation has been a very safe procedure; PI has been routinely offering this procedure to benign and cancer disease in the breast; so far, 18 cancer patients and 36 benign lesions have been subjected to the procedure. The following mild complications have been reported thus far: â€ Bruising at the site of ablation â€ selfâ€limited. â€ Pain â€ managed with OTC analgesics. â€ Skin necrosis is a theoretical possibility however, following the procedure protocol; we have never had this complication. Pembrolizumab related risks: There have been extensive studies on toxicities of immune checkpoint inhibitors.57 Standard recommended dose for Pemrolizumab is 200 mg IV per dose (approved by the FDA). Anticipated adverse effects include: â€ Rash â€ Diarrhea â€ Constipation â€ Nausea â€ Weight loss â€ Dry eyes â€ Fatigue â€ Headache â€ Fever â€ Joint pain â€ Thyroid dysfunction Loss of Confidentiality: All data will be maintained in passwordâ€protected files within the CRI and PI's office. All data will be deâ€identified for compilation and analysis. All protocols for HIPAA compliance will be followed. However, minimal risk of breach in confidentiality is possible due to human error. BENEFITS: The patients in arm II and III may benefit by participation in the trial. If our intuition of immune modulation via combination of cryotherapy and checkpoint inhibitor drug actually affects the control of tumor, these two groups will directly benefit form participation. However, the control arm I is not going to benefit from the trial beyond providing a comparison arm for the study. The main goal of the proposed study is to identify a novel lowâ€risk treatment approach to these highâ€risk cancers, which will ultimately benefit the future cancer patients. MONITORING: To ensure compliance with the study protocol, GCP guidelines, and TTUHSC Human Research Protection Program research policies and procedures during the conduct of the study, as well as quality data, a monitor in the Clinical Research Institute will conduct the monitoring of the study. The first monitoring visit will be co ducted within two weeks after the first subject has been enrolled into the study. The succeeding monitoring visits will be scheduled periodically, but no less than every 2 months when there is an active study participant, at a mutually agreed timeframe by the PI and study monitor. All data collected will be 100% source document verified. The study monitor may inspect and audit all study documents, i.e. data collection forms, questionnaires, drug accountability, and medical records within the applicable confidentiality regulations.

8513,"Recent developments pertaining to treatment‐resistant depression: A 40‐year perspective.^
Comments on an article by R. S. McIntyre et al. (see record [rid]2024-11189-009[/rid]). The concept of TRD is nearly as old as the first generation of effective treatments for depression, namely electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). The first papers using that concept were published in the 1970s. In that era, an almost intuitive hierarchy emerged on the basis of the clinical effort needed to implement the treatment: TCAs were generally used first, MAOIs second and ECT third for most patients. There were no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of TRD in that era, though clinical wisdom taught that MAOIs worked in about one half of the cases in which TCAs failed, and ECT was expected to benefit at least 80% of antidepressant non-responders. As a result, clinicians might have predicted that 70-90% of depressed patients could be treated effectively with this three-step proto- algorithm. While it remains to be seen whether intravenous ketamine or intranasal esketamine –the first FDA-approved therapy to result from these observations –will continue to be widely used a decade from now, it is a fact that the paradigm for drug discovery for TRD has changed for the foreseeable future. In this respect, the path for studying the therapeutic potential of neurosteroid drugs such as zuranolone, which is thought to in- directly affect glutamatergic neurotransmission through GABA-A receptor positive allosteric modulation, has been much less arduous than previously possible. Likewise, the paradigm change determined by the proven efficacy of intravenous ketamine, a con- trolled substance with abuse liability and characteristic dissociative effects, has prepared the field for a new wave of studies examining the therapeutic benefit of psilocybin and related psychedelic compounds that were once considered essentially off limits for therapeutic research. Finally, descendants of transcranial magnetic stimulation, including intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) and an accelerated high-dose iTBS protocol utilizing magnetic resonance imaging to guide or target functional connectivity, have given hope for the possibility of viable alternate neuromodulation strategies for patients with more advanced levels of TRD. McIntyre et al’s outline of the evidence concerning TRD, therefore, is timely and provides a thought-provoking overview of an exciting new era in the therapeutics of depression.

3335,"Do hallucinogens cause residual neuropsychological toxicity?.^
We collected and reviewed studies in which neuropsychological tests were administered to users of LSD or other hallucinogens. Interpretation of the studies is limited by various confounding variables, such as subjects' premorbid cognitive and personality function and prior use of other substances. At present, the literature tentatively suggests that there are few, if any, long-term neuropsychological deficits attributable to hallucinogen use. To better resolve this issue, however, it will be important to study larger samples of chronic, frequent hallucinogen users who have not often used other types of drugs.

7138,"Intranasal ketamine for procedural sedation in children: An open-label multicenter clinical trial.^
Introduction: There are limited options for pain and distress management in children undergoing minor proce-dures, without the burden of an intravenous line insertion. Prior to this study, we conducted a dose-escalation study and identified 6 mg/kg as a potentially optimal initial dose of intranasal ketamine.Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of intranasal ketamine at a dose of 6 mg/kg for procedural sedation to repair lacerations with sutures in children in the emergency department.Methods: We conducted a single-arm, open-label multicenter clinical trial for intranasal ketamine for laceration repair with sutures in children aged 1 to 12 years. A convenience sample of 30 patients received 6 mg/kg of in-tranasal ketamine for their procedural sedation. The primary outcome was the proportion (95% CI) of patients who achieved an effective procedural sedation.Results: We recruited 30 patients from April 2018 to December 2019 in two pediatric emergency departments in Canada. Lacerations repaired were mostly facial in 21(70%) patients and longer than 2 cm in 20 (67%) patients. Sedation was effective in 18/30 (60% [95% CI 45, 80]) children and was suboptimal in 5 (17%) patients but pro-cedure was completed in them with minimal difficulties. Sedation was poor in the remaining 7 (23%) patients, with 3 (10%) of them required additional sedative agents. No serious adverse events were reported. Conclusions: Using a single dose of 6 mg/kg of intranasal Ketamine for laceration repair led to successful sedation in 60% of patients according to our a priori definition. An additional 17% of patients were considered suboptimal, but their procedure was still completed with minimal difficulty.Clinical trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03053947).(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Inc.",0,"[0.969748318195343, 0.030251648277044296]",0
3107,"Memory impairment suggests hippocampal dysfunction in abstinent ecstasy users.^
Previous studies have consistently shown impairments of memory and learning in regular users of the neurotoxic drug ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine [MDMA]). In addition, deficits in working memory, planning ability and central executive control, as well as high cognitive impulsivity, were also reported in some studies. Hence, the memory decrements may be secondary due to other cognitive failures. The purpose of this study was to analyze the nature of the cognitive deficits of ecstasy users. Tests of memory, working memory, central executive function and cognitive impulsivity were administered to 60 currently abstinent ecstasy users and to 30 nonusers. Heavy ecstasy users (n=30, lifetime dose ≥80 ecstasy tablets) had lower memory performance than both nonusers and moderate users (n=30, lifetime dose <80 ecstasy tablets). In contrast, we found no group differences in central executive function, working memory, planning ability and cognitive impulsivity between ecstasy users and controls. Poorer memory and working memory performance was associated with a heavier pattern of ecstasy use. Low working memory, planning ability and central executive control and high cognitive impulsivity did not predict poor memory performance. Our results indicate primary memory dysfunction in heavy ecstasy users, which may be related to a particularly high vulnerability of the hippocampus to the neurotoxic effects of MDMA. Hippocampal dysfunction after ecstasy use may be a risk factor for earlier onset and/or more severe age-related memory decline in later years. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

4093,"Associations between classic psychedelics and opioid use disorder in a nationally-representative U.S. adult sample.^
Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a major source of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. and there is a pressing need to identify additional treatments for the disorder. Classic psychedelics (psilocybin, peyote, mescaline, LSD) have been linked to the alleviation of various substance use disorders and may hold promise as potential treatments for OUD. The aim of this study was to assess whether the aforementioned classic psychedelic substances conferred lowered odds of OUD. Furthermore, this study aimed to replicate and extend findings from Pisano et al. (2017) who found classic psychedelic use to be linked to lowered odds of OUD in a nationally representative sample. We used recent data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2015-2019) (N = 214,505) and multivariable logistic regression to test whether lifetime use (yes/no) of classic psychedelics was associated with lowered odds of OUD. Lifetime psilocybin use was associated with lowered odds of OUD (aOR: 0.70; 95% CI [0.60, 0.83]). No other substances, including other classic psychedelics, were associated with lowered odds of OUD. Additionally, sensitivity analyses revealed psilocybin use to be associated with lowered odds of seven of the 11 DSM-IV criteria for OUD (aOR range: 0.66-0.83). Future clinical trials and longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether these associations are causal.",1,"[0.006709819659590721, 0.9932901859283447]",0
3478,"Alcohol hangover has detrimental impact upon both executive function and prospective memory.^
The alcohol hangover (AH) is a state of general malaise following an evening of heavy episodic drinking when the blood alcohol concentration of the person reaches/approaches zero. The aim of the current study was to investigate what impact the AH has upon both executive function (EF) and prospective memory (PM). Previous research has shown that the AH has a detrimental effect upon cognitive abilities, including attention, working memory, and PM. The current study focused upon what impact AH might have upon both EF and related PM in the same cohort, both of which underpin everyday remembering. The current study compared an AH group (AHG) with a non-hangover group (NHG) on both EF and PM measures. Forty-one participants aged 18–29 years were tested; 19 comprised the AHG and 22 of whom made up the NHG (individuals who reported no heavy drinking the day before and did not report any significant hangover symptoms). A Verbal Fluency task measured EF and the Prospective Remembering Video Procedure measured PM. The Acute Hangover Rating Scale measured AH symptoms and severity, and a Digital Breath Analyzer Test measured their blood alcohol concentration (BAC). A Recreational Drug Use Questionnaire measured alcohol and other drug use. Anyone reporting having used an illicit substance across their lifetime (e.g., cannabis, ecstasy) or who smoked heavily were omitted from the study. Two univariate analyses of covariance compared the AHG and NHG groups on Verbal Fluency and Prospective Remembering Video Task scores (controlling for age, total alcohol units consumed per week, and the number of years spent drinking). The AHG recalled significantly fewer items on the Verbal Fluency task [F(1, 36) = 7.42, p < 0.01] and on the Prospective Remembering Video Task NHG [F(1, 36) = 14.9, p < 0.001] when compared with the NHG. Overall, it appeared that a state of AH significantly impaired both EF and PM. Given the importance of EF and PM to everyday remembering, these findings may have farther-reaching implications.",0,"[0.9895026683807373, 0.010497340001165867]",0

3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is currently being investigated as an adjunctive treatment to therapy for posttraumatic stress and other anxiety related disorders in clinical trials. Within the next few years MDMA-assisted therapy is projected for approval by regulatory authorities. MDMA's primary mechanism of action includes modulation of monoamine signaling by increasing release and inhibiting reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and, to a lesser extent, dopamine. This pharmacology affects sympathomimetic physiology. In controlled trials, special attention has been given to cardiovascular adverse events (AEs), because transient increases in heart rate and blood pressure have been observed during the MDMA-assisted therapy sessions. Finding and quantifying the potential drivers of cardiac AEs in clinical trials is difficult since only a relatively small number of participants have been included in these studies, and a limited set of allowed concomitant drugs has been studied. In this study a more diverse set of reports from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System was surveyed. We found 17 cases of cardiovascular AEs, in which the individuals had taken one or more substances in addition to MDMA. Interestingly, all of those concomitant medications and illicit substances, including opioids, stimulants, anticholinergics, and amphetamines, had been previously associated with cardiovascular AEs. Furthermore, in none of the reports MDMA was marked as the primary suspect.",0,"[0.6688012480735779, 0.3311987817287445]",1
6797,"Hand function is altered in individuals with a history of illicit stimulant use.^
Use of illicit stimulant drugs such as methamphetamine, cocaine, and ecstasy are a significant worldwide problem. However, little is known about the effect of these drugs on movement. The aim of the current study was to investigate hand function in adults with a history of illicit stimulant use. We hypothesized that prior use of illicit stimulant drugs is associated with abnormal manipulation of objects. The study involved 22 subjects with a history of illicit stimulant use (aged 29±8 yrs; time since last use: 1.8±4.0 yrs) and two control groups comprising 27 non-drug users (aged 25±8 yrs) and 17 cannabis users with no history of stimulant use (aged 22±5 yrs). Each subject completed screening tests (neuropsychological assessment, medical history questionnaire, lifetime drug history questionnaire, and urine drug screen) prior to gripping and lifting a light-weight object with the dominant right hand. Horizontal grip force, vertical lift force, acceleration, and first dorsal interosseus electromyographic (EMG) activity were recorded during three trials. In trial one, peak grip force was significantly greater in the stimulant group (12.8±3.9 N) than in the control groups (non-drug: 10.3±4.6 N; cannabis: 9.4±2.9 N, P<0.022). However, peak grip force did not differ between groups in trials two and three. The results suggest that individuals with a history of stimulant use overestimate the grip force required to manipulate a novel object but, are able to adapt grip force in subsequent lifts. The results suggest that movement dysfunction may be an unrecognized consequence of illicit stimulant use.",0,"[0.9878237247467041, 0.012176236137747765]",0
1065,"Cardiovascular autonomic dysregulation in users of MDMA ('Ecstasy').^
The present study examined resting heart rate variability (HRV; an index of parasympathetic tone) and heart rate response to the Valsalva maneuver (Valsalva ratio; an index of overall autonomic responsiveness) in 12 repeat users of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'Ecstasy'), and a matched comparison group of presumed nonusers. HRV and Valsalva ratio were smaller in users than in controls. Three out of 12 MDMA users but no controls had Valsalva ratios below 1.50, the cut-off for autonomic dysfunction. In several users, there was a total absence of post-Valsalva release bradycardia. All MDMA users were polydrug users. Parasympathetic cardiovascular tone appears impaired in repeat MDMA users, although the ubiquitous problems in such epidemiologic designs (including lack of testing before the first use of the drug and confounding with use of other drugs) preclude definitive causal interpretations.",1,"[0.0032088812440633774, 0.9967910647392273]",1
1476,"A high-throughput urinalysis of abused drugs based on a SPE-LC-MS/MS method coupled with an in-house developed post-analysis data treatment system.^
A rapid urinalysis system based on SPE-LC-MS/MS with an in-house post-analysis data management system has been developed for the simultaneous identification and semi-quantitation of opiates (morphine, codeine), methadone, amphetamines (amphetamine, methylamphetamine (MA), 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)), 11-benzodiazepines or their metabolites and ketamine. The urine samples are subjected to automated solid phase extraction prior to analysis by LC-MS (Finnigan Surveyor LC connected to a Finnigan LCQ Advantage) fitted with an Alltech Rocket Platinum EPS C-18 column. With a single point calibration at the cut-off concentration for each analyte, simultaneous identification and semi-quantitation for the abovementioned drugs can be achieved in a 10 min run per urine sample. A computer macro-program package was developed to automatically retrieve appropriate data from the analytical data files, compare results with preset values (such as cut-off concentrations, MS matching scores) of each drug being analyzed and generate user-defined Excel reports to indicate all positive and negative results in batch-wise manner for ease of checking. The final analytical results are automatically copied into an Access database for report generation purposes. Through the use of automation in sample preparation, simultaneous identification and semi-quantitation by LC-MS/MS and a tailored made post-analysis data management system, this new urinalysis system significantly improves the quality of results, reduces the post-data treatment time, error due to data transfer and is suitable for high-throughput laboratory in batch-wise operation. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

1230,"Insights into the neurobiology of suicidality: explicating the role of glutamatergic systems through the lens of ketamine.^
Suicidality is a prevalent mental health condition, and managing suicidal patients is one of the most challenging tasks for health care professionals due to the lack of rapid-acting, effective psychopharmacological treatment options. According to the literature, suicide has neurobiological underpinnings that are not fully understood, and current treatments for suicidal tendencies have considerable limitations. To treat suicidality and prevent suicide, new treatments are required; to achieve this, the neurobiological processes underlying suicidal behavior must be thoroughly investigated. Although multiple neurotransmitter systems, particularly serotonergic systems, have been studied in the past, less has been reported in relation to disruptions in glutamatergic neurotransmission, neuronal plasticity, and neurogenesis that result from stress-related abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system. Informed by the literature, which reports robust antisuicidal and antidepressive properties of subanaesthetic doses of ketamine, this review aims to provide an examination of the neurobiology of suicidality (and relevant mood disorders) with implications of pertinent animal, clinical, and postmortem studies. We discuss dysfunctions in the glutamatergic system, which may play a role in the neuropathology of suicidality and the role of ketamine in restoring synaptic connectivity at the molecular levels.",0,"[0.9922063946723938, 0.007793623022735119]",0
842,"Ketamine for Migraine in the Emergency Department.^
Ketamine is utilized often in the emergency department (ED) for rapid sequence intubation, procedural sedation, and acute pain management. The treatment of migraine headache in the ED varies widely and is dependent on several factors including migraine cause, previous successful abortive methods, and provider preference. Several medications are currently employed to treat acute migraine including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, triptans, antihistamines, prochlorperazine, and corticosteroids, among others. Interest in ketamine as an abortive agent to treat migraine has increased as evidenced by recent studies evaluating its use in the ED. This review examines the data regarding the use of ketamine to treat migraine headache. The concept of treating migraine headache with ketamine has been studied for more than 20 years. Early studies conducted primarily in the outpatient setting evaluated ketamine through multiple routes of administration and differing migraine causes with varying results. These early data seem to suggest that ketamine provides relief from headache severity but provides little information regarding the optimal dose and route of administration. Recent active comparator and placebo-controlled trials in the ED utilizing subdissociative doses of ketamine (0.2-0.3 mg/kg intravenously) show conflicting results. To confound the decision regarding its use further, ED providers encounter differing recommendations regarding its place in therapy. Current data suggest that ketamine may provide pain relief to patients with migraine headache. Although there may be a role for ketamine in certain cases after more robust evidence becomes available, currently it is premature to incorporate ketamine into routine use. Several questions remain to be answered including its overall efficacy, place in therapy, dosage, and risk of undesirable side effects.",0,"[0.9924988150596619, 0.007501231972128153]",0
4711,"Ecstasy-induced psychotic disorder: six-month follow-up study.^
OBJECTIVE: To describe the psychiatric symptoms manifested by persons diagnosed for the first time as having ecstasy-induced psychotic disorder and to explore the evolution of their symptoms over a 6-month period. DESIGN: Observational study with a 6-month follow-up. METHOD: The subjects studied were 32 ecstasy consumers who were treated at two drug-dependency outpatient centers for hallucinatory-delusive manifestations and who were diagnosed as having ecstasy-induced psychotic disorder according to DSM-IV criteria. For the assessment of the intensity of the syndrome and its follow-up, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) were used at the outset and after 1, 3 and 6 months. All subjects received treatment with olanzapine. RESULTS: The treatment program was completed by 96.9% of the patients. At the baseline assessment, a high incidence of symptoms of a severe psychiatric disorder was observed. From the first month the psychotic symptoms (BPRS) were considerably reduced with treatment, with the most severe positive symptoms remitting in the first 3 months. The three assessment indicators (BPRS, HDRS and CGI) showed a statistically significant clinical reduction over the 6 months of the assessment period. Furthermore, no relevant side effects were noted. CONCLUSIONS: In its initial manifestations, a drug-induced psychotic syndrome includes marked symptoms meeting the criteria of a severe psychotic disorder, with the presence of considerable positive and negative symptoms. Olanzapine has been shown to be very effective in these situations and its use is suggested as first-choice therapy.",1,"[0.002946477849036455, 0.9970535039901733]",1
2150,"Classical hallucinogens and neuroimaging: A systematic review of human studies: Hallucinogens and neuroimaging.^
Serotonergic hallucinogens produce alterations of perceptions, mood, and cognition, and have anxiolytic, antidepressant, and antiaddictive properties. These drugs act as agonists of frontocortical 5-HT2A receptors, but the neural basis of their effects are not well understood. Thus, we conducted a systematic review of neuroimaging studies analyzing the effects of serotonergic hallucinogens in man. Studies published in the PubMed, Lilacs, and SciELO databases until 12 April 2016 were included using the following keywords: “ayahuasca”, “DMT”, “psilocybin”, “LSD”, “mescaline” crossed one by one with the terms “mri”, “fmri”, “pet”, “spect”, “imaging” and “neuroimaging”. Of 279 studies identified, 25 were included. Acute effects included excitation of frontolateral/frontomedial cortex, medial temporal lobe, and occipital cortex, and inhibition of the default mode network. Long-term use was associated with thinning of the posterior cingulate cortex, thickening of the anterior cingulate cortex, and decreased neocortical 5-HT2A receptor binding. Despite the high methodological heterogeneity and the small sample sizes, the results suggest that hallucinogens increase introspection and positive mood by modulating brain activity in the fronto-temporo-parieto-occipital cortex.",1,"[0.013247769325971603, 0.9867522716522217]",1
3689,"Intraoperative ketamine administration to prevent delirium or postoperative cognitive dysfunction: A systematic review and meta-analysis.^
BACKGROUND: Postoperative cognitive complications are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Ketamine has been suggested to have neuroprotective effects in various settings. This systematic review evaluates the effects of intraoperative ketamine administration on postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). METHODS: Medline, Embase and Central were searched to 4 March 2018 without date or language restrictions. We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing intraoperative ketamine administration versus no intervention in adults undergoing surgery under general anaesthesia. Primary outcomes were postoperative delirium and POCD. Non-cognitive adverse events, mortality and length of stay were considered as secondary outcomes. Data were independently extracted. The quality of the evidence (GRADE approach) was assessed following recommendations from the Cochrane collaboration. Risk ratios were calculated for binary outcomes, mean differences for continuous outcomes. We planned to explore the effects of age, specific anaesthesia regimen, depth of anaesthesia and intraoperative haemodynamic events through subgroup analyses. RESULTS: Six RCTs were included. The incidence of postoperative delirium did not differ between groups (4 trials, 557 patients, RR 0.83, 95% CI [0.25, 2.80]), but patients receiving ketamine seemed at lower risk of POCD (3 trials, 163 patients, RR 0.34, 95% CI [0.15, 0.73]). However, both analyses presented limitations. Therefore, the quality of the evidence (GRADE) was deemed low (postoperative delirium) and very low (POCD). CONCLUSION: The effect of ketamine on postoperative delirium remains unclear but its administration may offer some protection towards POCD. Large, well-designed randomised trials are urgently needed to further clarify the efficacy of ketamine on neurocognitive outcomes.",1,"[0.017247634008526802, 0.9827523827552795]",1
8664,"Effects of the 5-HT2A agonist psilocybin on mismatch negativity generation and AX-continuous performance task: implications for the neuropharmacology of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.^
Previously the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor (NMDAR) antagonist ketamine was shown to disrupt generation of the auditory event-related potential (ERP) mismatch negativity (MMN) and the performance of an 'AX'-type continuous performance test (AX-CPT)--measures of auditory and visual context-dependent information processing--in a similar manner as observed in schizophrenia. This placebo-controlled study investigated effects of the 5-HT(2A) receptor agonist psilocybin on the same measures in 18 healthy volunteers. Psilocybin administration induced significant performance deficits in the AX-CPT, but failed to reduce MMN generation significantly. These results indirectly support evidence that deficient MMN generation in schizophrenia may be a relatively distinct manifestation of deficient NMDAR functioning. In contrast, secondary pharmacological effects shared by NMDAR antagonists and the 5-HT(2A) agonist (ie disruption of glutamatergic neurotransmission) may be the mechanism underlying impairments in AX-CPT performance observed during both psilocybin and ketamine administration. Comparable deficits in schizophrenia may result from independent dysfunctions of 5-HT(2A) and NMDAR-related neurotransmission.",1,"[0.003218550467863679, 0.9967814683914185]",1
4408,"Manipulating brain connectivity with δ⁹-tetrahydrocannabinol: a pharmacological resting state FMRI study.^
Resting state-functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-FMRI) is a neuroimaging technique that allows repeated assessments of functional connectivity in resting state. While task-related FMRI is limited to indirectly measured drug effects in areas affected by the task, resting state can show direct CNS effects across all brain networks. Hence, RS-FMRI could be an objective measure for compounds affecting the CNS. Several studies on the effects of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB(1))-receptor agonist δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on task-dependent FMRI have been performed. However, no studies on the effects of cannabinoids on resting state networks using RS-FMRI have been published. Therefore, we investigated the effects of THC on functional brain connectivity using RS-FMRI. Twelve healthy volunteers (9 male, 3 female) inhaled 2, 6 and 6 mg THC or placebo with 90-minute intervals in a randomized, double blind, cross-over trial. Eight RS-FMRI scans of 8 min were obtained per occasion. Subjects rated subjective psychedelic effects on a visual analog scale after each scan, as pharmacodynamic effect measures. Drug-induced effects on functional connectivity were examined using dual regression with FSL software (FMRIB Analysis Group, Oxford). Eight maps of voxel-wise connectivity throughout the entire brain were provided per RS-FMRI series with eight predefined resting-state networks of interest. These maps were used in a mixed effects model group analysis to determine brain regions with a statistically significant drug-by-time interaction. Statistical images were cluster-corrected, and results were Bonferroni-corrected across multiple contrasts. THC administration increased functional connectivity in the sensorimotor network, and was associated with dissociable lateralized connectivity changes in the right and left dorsal visual stream networks. The brain regions showing connectivity changes included the cerebellum and dorsal frontal cortical regions. Clear increases were found for feeling high, external perception, heart rate and cortisol, whereas prolactin decreased. This study shows that THC induces both increases and (to a lesser extent) decreases in functional brain connectivity, mainly in brain regions with high densities of CB(1)-receptors. Some of the involved regions could be functionally related to robust THC-induced CNS-effects that have been found in previous studies (Zuurman et al., 2008), such as postural stability, feeling high and altered time perception.",0,"[0.9888062477111816, 0.011193781159818172]",0
8166,"Lasting increases in trait mindfulness after psilocybin correlate positively with the mystical-type experience in healthy individuals.^
BACKGROUND: Psilocybin-induced mystical-type experiences are associated with lasting positive psychological outcomes. Recent studies indicate that trait mindfulness is increased 3 months after psilocybin intake, preceded by decreases in neocortical serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT(2A)R) binding. However, the association between psilocybin-induced mystical-type experiences and subsequent changes in trait mindfulness remains unexplored, as does the association between pre-drug trait mindfulness and 5-HT(2A)R binding in the healthy brain. AIM: We evaluated whether psilocybin induced lasting increases in trait mindfulness in healthy volunteers, and whether the mystical-type experience was associated with this increase. We further examined the association between pre-drug trait mindfulness and 5-HT(2A)R binding in neocortex and selected frontolimbic regions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-six medium-high dose psilocybin sessions were conducted in 39 healthy individuals. The mystical-type experience was measured with the Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ) at the end of the session. Trait mindfulness was measured using the Mindful Attention and Awareness Scale (MAAS) at baseline and 3 months after the psilocybin session. Thirty-two of the participants completed pre-drug [(11)C]-Cimbi-36 positron emission tomography (PET) to assess 5-HT(2A)R binding in neocortex and, post-hoc, in the frontolimbic regions amygdala, frontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex. RESULTS: The MAAS score was significantly increased at 3-month follow-up (p = 3.24 × 10(-6)), a change positively associated with the MEQ score (p = 0.035). Although the association between pre-drug MAAS score and neocortex 5-HT(2A)R binding was not significant (p = 0.24), post-hoc analyses revealed a significant negative association between MAAS and right amygdala 5-HT(2A)R binding (p(FWER) = 0.008). CONCLUSION: We here show that lasting changes in trait mindfulness following psilocybin administration are positively associated with intensity of the mystical-type experience, suggesting that the acute phenomenology of psilocybin facilitates a shift in awareness conducive for mindful living. We furthermore show that higher pre-drug trait mindfulness is associated with reduced 5-HT(2A)R binding in the right amygdala.",1,"[0.0031348729971796274, 0.9968650937080383]",1

Ibogaine is an alkaloid purported to be an effective drug dependence treatment. However, its efficacy has been hard to evaluate, partly because it is illegal in some countries. In such places, treatments are conducted in underground settings where fatalities have occurred. In Brazil ibogaine is unregulated and a combined approach of psychotherapy and ibogaine is being practiced to treat addiction. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of ibogaine, we conducted a retrospective analysis of data from 75 previous alcohol, cannabis, cocaine and crack users (72% poly-drug users). We observed no serious adverse reactions or fatalities, and found 61% of participants abstinent. Participants treated with ibogaine only once reported abstinence for a median of 5.5 months and those treated multiple times for a median of 8.4 months. This increase was statistically significant (p < 0.001), and both single or multiple treatments led to longer abstinence periods than before the first ibogaine session (p < 0.001). These results suggest that the use of ibogaine supervised by a physician and accompanied by psychotherapy can facilitate prolonged periods of abstinence, without the occurrence of fatalities or complications.

Rationale: Ketamine, a well-known general dissociative anesthetic agent that is a non-competitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, perturbs the perception of elapsed time and the expectation of upcoming events. Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the influence of ketamine on temporal expectation in the rhesus monkey. Methods: Two rhesus monkeys were trained to make a saccade between a central warning stimulus and an eccentric visual target that served as imperative stimulus. The delay between the warning and the imperative stimulus could take one of four different values randomly with the same probability (variable foreperiod paradigm). During experimental sessions, a subanesthetic low dose of ketamine (0.25–0.35 mg/kg) was injected i.m. and the influence of the drug on movement latency was measured. Results: We found that in the control conditions, saccadic latencies strongly decreased with elapsed time before the appearance of the visual target showing that temporal expectation built up during the delay period between the warning and the imperative stimulus. However, after ketamine injection, temporal expectation was significantly reduced in both subjects. In addition, ketamine also increased average movement latency but this effect could be dissociated from the reduction of temporal expectation. Conclusion: In conclusion, a subanesthetic dose of ketamine could have two independent effects: increasing reaction time and decreasing temporal expectation. This alteration of temporal expectation could explain cognitive deficits observed during ketamine use.

2110,"Opening the Doors of Prescription: Historical Contexts and Current Clinical Perspectives on Psychedelics in Psychiatry.^
After nearly 50 years of prohibition, psychedelics such as ketamine, 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphet-amine (MDMA), psilocybin, and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) have reemerged as potential adjuncts to psychotherapy for psychiatric disorders. Numerous clinical studies have confirmed the antidepressant and antisuicidal effects of ketamine, culminating in the approval of intranasal (S)-ketamine in treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and depression with suicidal ideation. More recently, randomized controlled trials of psychedelic-assisted therapy have found that MDMA is safe and efficacious in severe and chronic posttraumatic stress disorder, while psilocybin has shown promise in TRD and end-of-life anxiety and depression. Although fewer modern clinical trials have evaluated LSD for psychiatric indications, preliminary findings suggest it could be effective for mood and substance use disorders. Psychedelics have generally been well-tolerated at therapeutic doses with few serious adverse effects. In addition, neuroimaging studies with psychedelics have offered insights into the neural underpinnings of psychiatric disease and the role of neurotransmitter dysfunction, specifically glutamate, in psychopathology. Despite these encouraging developments, psychedelic research warrants a cautious approach and a critical understanding of current and anticipated barriers to rigorous experimentation (eg, inadequate blinding, small sample sizes, unknown treatment mechanisms or potential long-term risks) and treatment implementation (eg, legal restrictions, high resource utilization of psychedelic-assisted therapy). This article will provide a narrative review of historical psychedelic research, discuss the current state of psychedelic treatment (focusing on approved drugs and late-stage clinical trials), and offer a balanced perspective on the possible pitfalls and future promise of psychedelics in psychiatry. © 2022 Connecticut State Medical Society.

4915,"Predicting efficacy of sub-anesthetic ketamine/esketamine i.v. dose during course of cesarean section for PPD prevention, utilizing traditional logistic regression and machine learning models.^
OBJECTIVE: Increasing researches supported that intravenous ketamine/esketamine during the perioperative period of cesarean section could prevent postpartum depression(PPD). With the effective rate ranging from 87.2 % to 95.5 % in PPD, ketamine/esketamine's responsiveness was individualized. To optimize ketamine dose/form based on puerpera prenatal characteristics, reducing adverse events and improving the total efficacy rate, prediction models were developed to predict ketamine/esketamine's efficacy. METHOD: Based on two randomized controlled trials, 12 prenatal features of 507 women administered the ketamine/esketamine intervention were collected. Traditional logistics regression, SVM, random forest, KNN and XGBoost prediction models were established with prenatal features and dosage regimen as predictors. RESULTS: According to the logistic regression model (a(in) = 0.10, a(out) = 0.15, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, AUC = 0.728), prenatal Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score ≥ 10, thoughts of self-injury and bad mood during pregnancy were associated with poorer ketamine efficacy in PPD prevention, whilst a high dose of esketamine (0.25 mg/kg loading dose+2 mg/kg PCIA) was the most effective dosage regimen and esketamine was more recommended rather than ketamine in PPD. The AUC(validation set) of KNN and XGBoost model were 0.815 and 0.651, respectively. CONCLUSION: Logistic regression and machine learning algorithm, especially the KNN model, could predict the effectiveness of ketamine/esketamine iv. during the course of cesarean section for PPD prevention. An individualized preventative strategy could be developed after entering puerpera clinical features into the model, possessing great clinical practice value in reducing PPD incidence.",1,"[0.015196597203612328, 0.9848034381866455]",1
729,"Ibogaine and addiction in the animal model, a systematic review and meta-analysis.^
Ibogaine is a naturally occurring substance which has been increasingly used in the lay-scene to reduce craving and relapse in patients with substance use disorders (SUDs). Although human clinical trials on the safety and efficacy of ibogaine are lacking, animal studies do support the efficacy of ibogaine. In this systematic review and meta-analysis (MA), we summarise these animal findings, addressing three questions: (1) does ibogaine reduce addictive behaviour in animal models of SUDs?; (2) what are the toxic effects of ibogaine on motor functioning, cerebellum and heart rhythm?; (3) what are neuropharmacological working mechanisms of ibogaine treatment in animal models of SUDs? MA of 27 studies showed that ibogaine reduced drug selfadministration, particularly during the first 24 h after administration. Ibogaine had no effect on drug-induced conditioned place preference. Ibogaine administration resulted in motor impairment in the first 24 h after supplementation, and cerebral cell loss even weeks after administration. Data on ibogaines effect on cardiac rhythm, as well as on its neuropharmacological working mechanisms are limited. Our results warrant further studies into the clinical efficacy of ibogaine in SUD patients in reducing craving and substance use, but close monitoring of the patients is recommended because of the possible toxic effects. In addition, more work is needed to unravel the neuropharmacological working mechanisms of ibogaine and to investigate its effects on heart rhythm.",0,"[0.8248391151428223, 0.17516086995601654]",0
6909,"Assessment of chronic exposure to MDMA in a group of consumers by segmental hair analysis.^
The suitability of segmental hair analysis of MDMA to monitor past chronic exposure to the drug was investigated in a follow-up study of ecstasy consumers. The purpose, among others, was to look for an objective biomarker of the history of drug consumption. Thirteen naturally colored hair samples were used to assess possible association between hair concentration of MDMA in 1-, 5-, and 9-cm segments and self-reported use in the last 1, 6, and 12 months. Agreement between the self-reported data given by the subjects on their ""ecstasy"" use in the previous month and MDMA hair concentration was good (r = 0.92) in all the examined subjects, with the exception of 2 individuals who declared a high consumption of the drug (12 tablets in the last month). When comparing the subjects' declaration of tablets consumed per month within the last 6 months, concordance with the hair MDMA values decreased and no correlation seemed to exist between the mean number of tablets consumed in the last 12 months and the concentration of MDMA in hair. However, when grouping subjects with a similar level of declared drug use (independently of whether in the previous month, last 6 months and last 12 months) and comparing the data with the mean MDMA concentrations found in the corresponding hair segments, an excellent level of agreement was found in groups of subjects consuming <5 tablets of MDMA per month (r = 0.93). Although the present findings were obtained from a small group of individuals and are intended as preliminary results, we can conclude that a cutoff of 0.5 ng MDMA per mg hair seems reasonable to assess drug consumption, unless the level of consumption was once per month in the last 12 months. Doubling the monthly consumption increases hair MDMA by around 1 ng/mg hair up to a level of 4 consumed tablets a month. It does not seem possible to draw definitive conclusions from higher concentrations in hair samples.

1452,"Low-dose ketamine infusion for treating subjective cognitive, somatic, and affective depression symptoms of treatment-resistant depression.^
BACKGROUNDS: Whether the antidepressant effects of low-dose ketamine infusion and the therapeutic impact of Val66Met brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) polymorphism vary across different depression symptom domains, namely affective, cognitive, and somatic, remains unclear. METHODS: We-reanalyzed the data of Adjunctive Ketamine Study of Taiwanese Patients with Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD). A total of 71 patients with TRD were randomized to three infusion groups: 0.5 and 0.2 mg/kg ketamine groups and the normal saline placebo group. The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) was used to obtain self-reported scores prior to infusion and 240 min after infusion and sequentially on days 3, 7, and 14 after infusion. The three-factor model of cognitive, somatic, and affective depressive symptoms that is based on the BDI-II and proposed by Beck et al. was applied in the current study. The Val66Met BDNF polymorphism was genotyped. RESULTS: Ketamine infusion exerted rapid and sustained antidepressant effects on the affective (p = 0.014) and cognitive (p = 0.005) depression symptom domains but not on the somatic (p = 0.085) depression symptom domain. Only patients with TRD harboring any Val allele at the BDNF rs6265 polymorphism were more likely to respond (p = 0.011) to low-dose ketamine infusion. DISCUSSION: Additional studies should elucidate different mechanisms underlying the effects of ketamine infusion on cognitive, affective, and somatic depression symptom domains in patients with TRD.",1,"[0.0023864000104367733, 0.9976136684417725]",1
3802,"Use of hallucinogenic drugs on campus.^
Reports results from a 1-page anonymous questionnaire on the use of hallucinogens which was mailed to a 10% and a 33% random sample of Yale and Wesleyan undergraduates, respectively. The 3 major questions were (1) whether the respondent had ever seriously considered using LSD, dimethyltryptamine, psilocybin, peyote, marijuana, mescaline, morning glory seeds, or other hallucinogens; (2) whether he knew anyone who had taken these drugs; and (3) whether he had personally used any of these drugs. Response rate was 80% for Yale, and 66% for Wesleyan. It was found that marijuana was the most widely used drug. LSD use was reported on both campuses, though it was not considered prevalent. An overwhelming majority of students who had never used hallucinogens reported that they knew users. The difficulties in preventing drug use were indicated by the large percentage of users who reported beneficial effects. It is suggested that there should be more opportunity for open discussion of drug use, and more factual information should be distributed. More detailed, inclusive surveys of this type are considered necessary. (15 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",1,"[0.46178945899009705, 0.5382105708122253]",1
5595,"P.0421 Efficacy and safety of psilocybin in treatment-resistant major depression (EPIsoDE) – study design, rationale and current status.^
Background: Psilocybin, a partial serotonin (5‐HT) 2A receptor agonist, has shown promising safety and efficacy results in the treatment of major depression and other psychiatric disorders [e.g. reviewed in 1]. While results from modern pilot studies on psilocybin in the treatment of major depression and other psychiatric disorders are promising, most of those trials lack randomization, double‐blinding, and a sufficient sample size. The use of double‐blinding and an appropriate placebo is particularly difficult in psychedelic trials, facing ethical issues as well as the risk of nocebo effects in patients in the comparator groups. Accordingly, there is an immense need for additional, larger, well‐designed randomized‐controlled studies. Objectives: The phase 2 EPIsoDE‐Trial (NCT04670081) aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of a high psilocybin dose (25 mg, p.o.) administered in a psychotherapeutic context in treatment‐resistant major depression in a randomized‐controlled, bi‐centric, parallel‐group, double‐blind design. We expect significant and stable treatment responses after a high (25 mg) dose of psilocybin in comparison to placebo (100 mg nicotinamide) and a low/supposedly inactive control dose (5 mg psilocybin), while provoking only mild and transient adverse events (AE). As a secondary objective the effect of a second high dose six weeks after the first dose will be assessed. Exploratory objectives are aimed at identifying potential neurobiological and psychological therapeutic mechanisms of psilocybin treatment. Methods: 144 patients (25 – 65 years of age) diagnosed with treatment‐resistant major depression of moderate to severe degree will be enrolled in the study, all of which will receive two dosing sessions six weeks apart. Treatment‐resistance is defined as no improvement in depression despite two adequate courses of antidepressant treatment of different pharmacological classes. After informed consent and potentially down‐titration of their antidepressant medication, patients will be randomized to one of four treatment arms: 1) receiving placebo (100 mg nicotinamide) first, 25 mg psilocybin second; 2) receiving the presumably sub‐effective psilocybin dose (5 mg) first, the high dose (25 mg) second; 3a) receiving 25 mg psilocybin first, 5 mg psilocybin second; 3b) receiving the high psilocybin dose (25 mg) at both sessions. Dosing sessions will be accompanied by multiple psychotherapeutic preparation and integration sessions. The second dose takes place after assessment of the primary endpoint; the primary endpoint is treatment response, defined as a minimum of 50% reduction in symptoms as measured with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM‐D), six weeks after the first dose. Outlook: The trial is currently being conducted at the Central Institute of Mental Health in Mannheim as well as the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Campus Charité Mitte. The trial design, including the randomization, double blinding and comparator conditions, will allow valid conclusions on the efficacy and safety of psilocybin treatment in major depression. Conflict of interest Disclosure statement: The trial is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF 01EN2006A and 01EN2006B) it has been approved by the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM) and the responsible Ethics Committees",1,"[0.003230821108445525, 0.9967691898345947]",1
2505,"Increased signal diversity/complexity of spontaneous EEG, but not evoked EEG responses, in ketamine-induced psychedelic state in humans.^
How and to what extent electrical brain activity reflects pharmacologically altered states and contents of consciousness, is not well understood. Therefore, we investigated whether measures of evoked and spontaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) signal diversity are altered by sub-anaesthetic levels of ketamine compared to normal wakefulness, and how these measures relate to subjective experience. High-density 62-channel EEG was used to record spontaneous brain activity and responses evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in 10 healthy volunteers before and during administration of sub-anaesthetic doses of ketamine in an open-label within-subject design. Evoked signal diversity was assessed using the perturbational complexity index (PCI), calculated from EEG responses to TMS perturbations. Signal diversity of spontaneous EEG, with eyes open and eyes closed, was assessed by Lempel Ziv complexity (LZc), amplitude coalition entropy (ACE), and synchrony coalition entropy (SCE). Although no significant difference was found in TMS-evoked complexity (PCI) between the sub-anaesthetic ketamine condition and normal wakefulness, all measures of spontaneous EEG signal diversity (LZc, ACE, SCE) showed significantly increased values in the sub-anaesthetic ketamine condition. This increase in signal diversity correlated with subjective assessment of altered states of consciousness. Moreover, spontaneous signal diversity was significantly higher when participants had eyes open compared to eyes closed, both during normal wakefulness and during influence of sub-anaesthetic ketamine. The results suggest that PCI and spontaneous signal diversity may reflect distinct, complementary aspects of changes in brain properties related to altered states of consciousness: the brain's capacity for information integration, assessed by PCI, might be indicative of the brain's ability to sustain consciousness, while spontaneous complexity, as measured by EEG signal diversity, may be indicative of the complexity of conscious content. Thus, sub-anaesthetic ketamine may increase the complexity of the conscious content and the brain activity underlying it, while the level or general capacity for consciousness remains largely unaffected.",1,"[0.002831721678376198, 0.997168242931366]",1
5758,"Syllogistic reasoning performance in MDMA (Ecstasy) users.^
Previous research has demonstrated working memory and executive deficits in recreational users of MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine; Ecstasy). In turn, both of these constructs have been implicated in syllogistic reasoning performance. Twenty-two MDMA users (mean age = 21.36) and 26 MDMA nonuser controls (mean age = 21.31) were tested on syllogisms of varying difficulty and on measures of working memory and executive functioning. MDMA users were significantly impaired in aspects of syllogistic reasoning, and the effect remained significant after the authors controlled for the use of other drugs. However, the MDMA-related variance was reduced to below statistical significance following control for group differences in working memory span. The results are consistent with the possibility that MDMA-related deficits in aspects of executive functioning result in impaired reasoning performance among MDMA users.",1,"[0.003935035318136215, 0.9960649609565735]",1
8614,"Patterns in drug use in the United Kingdom as revealed through analysis of hair in a large population sample.^
This paper presents an overview of the most common sectioning patterns utilised in the analysis of hair for drug use; report on the major user groups (sectors) that currently make use of hair analysis in the United Kingdom (UK); present the results for the different drug groups analysed in samples of hair samples analysed at TrichoTech between 2001 and 2005. A total of 186,084 tests on 34,626 hair samples were performed for the commonly requested drug groups. There were 145,799 enzyme-linked Immunosorbent positive screening tests (ELISA), which were subsequently confirmed by gas chromatography equipped with mass spectrometry detection (GC-MS). The two major sectors were the Medico-Legal sector (65%) and Workplace (20%). Police (Forensics), Clinical Monitoring, Schools, Research and Insurance accounted together for the remaining 15% of the samples. Combinations of several sections patterns were requested covering periods from the most recent month up to 24 months. The most common sectioning pattern was one single section measuring 3 cm, to cover the most recent 3 months (44%), which in some cases was complemented by a further 3 cm to cover together 6 months (13%). The second most common sectioning pattern was the analysis of three sections of 1 cm each to cover the most recent 3 months (28%), when a more detailed evaluation of drug use pattern was relevant. Samples collected from other areas of the body such as axilla, pubic, chest, beard and leg, constituted 6% of the samples. The analysis of monthly sections plays an important role in the evaluation and interpretation of drug use, particularly in certain Medico-Legal cases. The sectors with the highest rates of positive results were Police (Forensics) (78%), Medico-Legal (62%) and Clinical (54%). The common drugs in each group were cannabinol (27%), cocaine (25%), morphine (17%), amphetamine (13%) and diazepam (15%). The positive rate for the Workplace sector was 10%. The most common drugs detected in the Workplace samples in each group were: THC (4%), codeine (2%), cocaine (2%), MDMA (0.5%) and diazepam (0.1%). The concentration levels of drugs found in samples from the workplace were lower than in the other sectors (95% of cases). The exceptions were for dihydrocodeine and MDMA, where levels were 170 and 143% higher, respectively. However, the maximum levels detected in the Workplace samples were lower. The Medico-Legal sector is the most prevalent sector using hair analysis in the UK but the rate of Workplace sector use of hair testing is increasing. One in 10 workplace hair tests detected the presence of at least one drug, which is twice the rate of detection using urine, which is a 1 in 20 urine sample. This means that the chances of identifying people on drugs in the workplace by testing hair samples are twice as likely than urine samples. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

2797,"A scoping review of spirituality in relation to substance use disorders: Psychological, biological, and cultural issues.^
BACKGROUND: Spirituality is a construct encompassing a diversity of strongly held beliefs and pursuits related to life's meaning and purpose. Empirical studies in key domains of spirituality related to substance use disorder (SUD) can be valuable in guiding research, and potentially clinical care. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a scoping review of research on the psychological, biological, and cultural dimensions of spirituality and their role in relation to SUD. To identify limitations in empirical findings within these domains and identify promising areas for related research. DATA SOURCES, STUDY APPRAISAL, AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Illustrative studies available in the empirical literature are reviewed in order to characterize these three key domains. RESULTS: Certain areas of importance stand out: On Psychology, attribution of SUD to a spiritual outlook; spiritual awakening; the relation of spirituality to drug craving; and spirituality in the context of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy. On Biology, heritability of traits related to shared spiritual experience; neurophysiologic correlates of spiritually related experiences; and correlates in brain imaging; On Culture, spiritual aspects of SUD in different cultural settings; distinctions between spiritual and religious phenomena; roles that international organizations play; and context of acquiring recovery capital. The need for further research in each area is defined. CONCLUSIONS: There is utility in examining the diversity of findings in the roles of psychology, biology, and culture in the SUD field. Further research, particularly applying randomization and clinical controls, would be useful in improving the effective application of the construct of spirituality in clinical care.",0,"[0.9891069531440735, 0.010893081314861774]",0
1777,"Acute effects of ayahuasca in a juvenile non-human primate model of depression.^
OBJECTIVE: The incidence rate of major depression in adolescents reaches approximately 14%. This disorder is usually recurrent, without remission of symptoms even after pharmacological treatment, and persists throughout adult life. Since the effects of antidepressants take approximately 2 weeks to begin, new pharmacological therapies are under continuous exploration. Recent evidence suggests that psychedelics could produce rapid antidepressant effects. In this study, we evaluated the potential antidepressant effects of ayahuasca in a juvenile non-human primate model of depression. METHODS: While living with their families, juvenile marmosets (8 males; 7 females) were observed on alternate days for four weeks during a baseline phase. This was followed by 8 weeks of an induced depressive state protocol, the social isolated context (IC), in which the animals were monitored in the first and last weeks. Subsequently, five males and four females were randomly selected for treatment, first with a single administration of saline vehicle (1.67 mL/300 g of body weight, via gavage), followed by a single dose of ayahuasca (1.67 mL/300 g of body weight, via gavage). Both phases lasted 1 week and the animals were monitored daily. A third week of sampling was called the tardive-pharmacological effects phase. In all phases the marmosets were assessed for behavior, fecal cortisol levels, and body weight. RESULTS: After IC, the animals presented typical hypocortisolemia, but cortisol recovered to baseline levels 24 h after an acute dose of ayahuasca; this recovery was not observed in vehicle-treated animals. Additionally, in males, ayahuasca, but not the vehicle, reduced scratching, a stereotypic behavior, and increased feeding. Ayahuasca treatment also improved body weight to baseline levels in both sexes. The ayahuasca-induced behavioral response had long-term effects (14 days). Thus, in this translational juvenile animal model of depression, ayahuasca presented beneficial effects. CONCLUSIONS: These results can contribute to the validation of ayahuasca as an antidepressant drug and encourage new studies on psychedelic drugs as a tool for treating mood disorders, including for adolescents with early-onset depression.",0,"[0.9381349682807922, 0.061864953488111496]",0

Psychiatrists and psychotherapists in the US (1970s to 1985) and Switzerland (1988-1993) used MDMA legally as a prescription drug, to enhance the effectiveness of psychotherapy. Early reports suggest that it is useful in treating trauma-related disorders. Recently, the first completed pilot study of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD yielded encouraging results. Designed to test the safety and efficacy of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in patients with treatment-resistant PTSD; our randomized, double-blind, active-placebo controlled trial enrolled 12 patients for treatment with either low-dose (25 mg, plus 12.5 mg supplemental dose) or full-dose MDMA (125 mg, plus 62.5 mg supplemental dose). MDMA was administered during three experimental sessions, interspersed with weekly non-drug-based psychotherapy sessions. Outcome measures used were the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS). Patients were assessed at baseline, three weeks after the second and third MDMA session (end of treatment), and at the 2-month and 1-year follow-ups. We found that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy can be safely administered in a clinical setting. No drug-related serious adverse events occurred. We did not see statistically significant reductions in CAPS scores (p = 0.066), although there was clinically and statistically significant self-reported (PDS) improvement (p = 0.014).

After donepezil treatment, substantial improvements were found on tasks of nonverbal fluid reasoning (i.e. matrix reasoning) and other executive functioning tests (i.e. BADS). At entry into the study, poor academic performance and subjective problems with memory and concentration were reported, particularly after amphetamine use (i.e. MDMA and crystal methamphetamine); after donepezil treatment, dramatic increases in memory, concentration and academic achievement were observed. The finding of improvements in tests of executive functioning and in academic performance in this case study, together with the minimal adverse side effects of donepezil, warrants the investigation of controlled studies of cholinergic enhancement in chronic amphetamine and other drug users.",0,"[0.9854235053062439, 0.0145765021443367]",0

Reports an error in 'Antidepressant and neurocognitive effects of serial ketamine administration versus ECT in depressed patients' by Laura Basso, Luisa Bönke, Sabine Aust, Matti Gärtner, Isabella Heuser-Collier, Christian Otte, Katja Wingenfeld, Malek Bajbouj and Simone Grimm (Journal of Psychiatric Research, 2020[Apr], Vol 123, 1-8). Under 2.2.2, the authors wrote that patients received R-ketamine; however, the correct sentence should be as follows: Patients received racemic ketamine (R/S, enantiomer ratio of 1:1) infusions of 0.5 mg per kg of body weight over a period of 40 min. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2020-14569-002[/rid]). Background: While electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is considered the gold standard for acute treatment of patients with otherwise treatment-resistant depression, ketamine has recently emerged as a fast-acting treatment alternative for these patients. Efficacy and onset of action are currently among the main factors that influence clinical decision making, however, the effect of these treatments on cognitive functions should also be a crucial point, given that cognitive impairment in depression is strongly related to disease burden and functional recovery. ECT is known to induce transient cognitive impairment, while little is known about ketamine's impact on cognition. This study therefore aims to compare ECT and serial ketamine administration not only with regard to their antidepressant efficacy but also to acute neurocognitive effects. Methods: Fifty patients suffering from depression were treated with either serial ketamine infusions or ECT. Depression severity and cognitive functions were assessed before, during, and after treatment. Results: ECT and ketamine administration were equally effective, however, the antidepressant effects of ketamine occurred faster. Ketamine improved neurocognitive functioning, especially attention and executive functions, whereas ECT was related to a small overall decrease in cognitive performance. Conclusions: Due to its pro-cognitive effects and faster antidepressant effect, serial ketamine administration might be a more favorable short-term treatment option than ECT. Limitations: As this research employed a naturalistic study design, patients were not systematically randomized, there was no control group and patients received concurrent and partially changing medications during treatment.

8031,"Associations between lifetime classic psychedelic use and markers of physical health.^
Background: In recent years, there has been significant research on the mental health effects of classic psychedelic use, but there is very little evidence on how classic psychedelics might influence physical health. Aims: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the associations between lifetime classic psychedelic use and markers of physical health. Methods: Using data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2015-2018) with 171,766 (unweighted) adults aged 18 or above in the United States, the current study examined the associations between lifetime classic psychedelic use and three markers of physical health (self-reported overall health, body mass index, and heart condition and/or cancer in the past 12 months) while controlling for a range of covariates. Results: Respondents who reported having tried a classic psychedelic at least once in their lifetime had significantly higher odds of greater self-reported overall health and significantly lower odds of being overweight or obese versus having a normal weight. The association between lifetime classic psychedelic use and having a heart condition and/or cancer in the past 12 months approached conventional levels of significance, with lower odds of having a heart condition and/or cancer in the past 12 months for respondents who had tried a classic psychedelic at least once. Conclusion: The results of the present study suggest that classic psychedelics may be beneficial to physical health.

983,"Experiential phenomenology of cluster headache.^
Objectives Cluster headache (CH) is a rare disease (1 to 3/1000), predominant in men (sex ratio: four men/one woman) and characterized by frequent very painful paroxystic attacks occurring sometimes eight times by day. CH is a disease without lesion and impairs the quality of life of patients. Attacks occur only on the same hemiface and can last from 15 minutes to 3 hours. The pain is particularly severe and a frequent and extreme psychiatric symptomatology is observed during the attacks. Treatments are rare and not always efficient: sumatriptan, oxygen, LSD, psilocybin. In this paper, we try to answer to the question: “What does that make you to have a cluster headache attack?” using elicitation interview developed by Vermersch. Patients and methods Ten patients have been interviewed using elicitation interview (EI) (40–50 min for one interview). All these patients (seven men's and three women's) T suffer from chronic or episodic CH, with a mean age of 43 years. The patients come from the Lariboisière hospital (Paris), and more precisely from the center of headache urgency. EI allows describing the pre-reflexive consciousness contents. The method is described in Balzani et al., and in Petitmengin et al. (see bibliography). Data analyses were performed using Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). Results From the EI, we have distinguished three phenomenological axes, following Heidegger's philosophy: (1) An alteration of being-to-the-world with a strong unbearable feeling of imprisonment, and physical restriction. At the same time the patients present a stereotypical and automatic behavior with few motor schemes and escaping strategies. When pain arises, they want to leave and to go very far. Aggressive behaviors frequently occur. Sometimes, the patients are not able to perform the sumatripan injection, due to a motor inhibition. Some patients try to do autohypnosis or other methods to resist to the pain. (2) An alteration of being-to-the self, going from the corporal distortion to the body dissolution. At the onset of symptoms, the patient does the experience of physical deformation, particularly of the face, with strong vegetative symptoms. The patient is not able to control corporeal manifestations: tears, mad thinks, incoherent projects in order to stop the crisis. Some patients want to remove the part of their body where the pain is the most intense (eye, for example). There is a losing of the body limits and a loss of the time orientation. In many cases, the pain is unbearable and patients want to commit suicide. At the extreme, the sensation of self seems destroyed, and some patients evoke an experience similar than Near Death Experiences, or describe an experience of swaying in emptiness or imminent death. (3) An alteration of being-to-the-other, going from the imperative solitude to the acceptance for a presence without words. Solitude is the most experience for the patients. They cannot accept anybody. Another person is unbearable, because asking questions about the crisis. In the same time, the patient is scared of this solitude since he is not able to speak about his painful experience. In summary, the structure of the self is altered, and thinking is completely disturbed. The experience of time and space is modified and a pragmatism is a consequence of this intense pain. During the crisis, pain is central and the patient lives a kind of dissolution, near death: a self-dismantling. Conclusion The EI have allowed us to describe precisely the painful experience of subjects with a cluster headache. This experience is very rich and very intense. EI, as a phenomenological method, is a very useful method to describe more precisely the symptomatology of a disease, because it pays attention to the effective experience of the pathological flesh, as compared to the pathological body.",0,"[0.977633535861969, 0.022366486489772797]",0
5387,"Which treatment for which alcoholics? A review.^
All common treatment programs for alcoholics have similar success rates. Success in this context includes complete abstinence, controlled drinking, or simply an improved ability to manage addiction in a socially acceptable way. Success rates are between 40 and 50 %, including spontaneous remissions. The one-year outcome is similar to the five-year outcome, as most of the relapses occur within the first year after treatment. The prognostic factors of the patient are of primary importance for a positive result. There are no absolute indications for a particular program but some relative indications. Inpatient treatment is indicated in case of social and psychic instability. Outpatient treatment provides social stability of the patient and is to be preferred if inpatient treatment endangers the client's job. In spite of a high drop-out rate outpatient treatment is no less effective than other forms of therapy. The indication for halfway houses are previous inpatient treatment and social isolation. An additional requisite is a strong motivation for rehabilitation. The criteria for conditioning therapy in literature are not very convincing. It is supposed to be more apt for extroverted patients with clear psychopathological symptoms. Group psychotherapy is advisable for patients with verbal competence and field independency. Even patients who seem to be particulalrly nonintrospective may significantly profit from group therapy. The effect of drug therapy is dubious. It should only be used as a supportive measure if the patient lives in stable social surroundings. The preconditions for the patient's profit from self-help groups are predominantly traits of character which enable him to affiliate spontaneously. Self-help groups are certainly not useful for any alcoholic. There are only few reports on family therapy.",0,"[0.9895546436309814, 0.010445312596857548]",0
7174,"Altered State of Consciousness and Mental Imagery as a Function of N, N-dimethyltryptamine Concentration in Ritualistic Ayahuasca Users.^
Consumption of the psychedelic brew ayahuasca is a central ritualistic aspect of the Santo Daime religion. The current observational, baseline controlled study was designed to assess whether members (n = 24) of the Santo Daime church would show enhanced capacity for mental imagery during an ayahuasca experience. In addition, this study assessed whether the effects of ayahuasca on consciousness and mental imagery were related to peak serum concentration of N, N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), the main psychoactive component. Measures of altered states of consciousness (5-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness Questionnaire) and ego dissolution (Ego Dissolution Inventory [EDI]) as well as measures of mental imagery (visual perspective shifting, vividness of visual imagery, cognitive flexibility, associative thinking) were taken on two subsequent days on which members of Santo Daime were sober or drank a self-selected volume of ayahuasca. Measures of altered states of consciousness revealed that feelings of oceanic boundlessness, visual restructuralization, and EDI increased most prominently after drinking and shared a positive correlation with peak DMT concentration. Measures of mental imagery did not noticeably differ between the baseline and ayahuasca condition, although subjective ratings of cognitive flexibility were lower under ayahuasca. Two measures related to mental imagery, that is, perspective shifts and cognitive flexibility, were significantly correlated to peak DMT concentrations. Peak concentrations of DMT and other alkaloids did not correlate with ayahuasca dose. These findings confirm previous notions that the primary phenomenological characteristics of ayahuasca are driven by DMT. Compensatory or neuroadaptive effects associated with long-term ayahuasca intake may have mitigated the acute impact of ayahuasca in Santo Daime members on mental imagery.",1,"[0.0034167724661529064, 0.9965832829475403]",1

A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with fluorimetric detection was developed for the simultaneous determination of ibogaine and noribogaine in human plasma using fluorescein as internal standard. This method involved a solid phase extraction of the compounds from plasma using N-vinylpyrrolidone-divinybenzene copolymer cartridges. Separation of the three analytes was performed on a reversed-phase Supelcosil C18 analytical column (75 mm × 4.6 mm i.d., 3 μm particle size). The excitation wavelength was set at 230 nm for the first 15.8 min and then at 440 nm for the following 14.2 min; the emission wavelength was set at 336 nm for the first 15.8 min and then at 514 nm for the following 14.2 min.

1401,"Illicit substances identified in the urines of 11.170 suspected drug users in north tunisia.^
Introduction: according to the latest World Drug Report, 271 million people worldwide (5.5% of the global population) aged 15-64 years are drug users. Drug addiction and trafficking became an urgent public health problem that affects human health and social life. A cross-sectional study was conducted from January 2016 to December 2018, to identify the socio-demographic profile of drug users captured by the anti-narcotics squad in North of Tunisia (North African country) and to type, through toxicological analysis, the nature of the substances consumed. Methods: data were collected from expertise files of 11170 suspected drug users. Fresh urine samples were collected from suspected drugs users and submitted in the toxicology laboratory of the center for Urgent Medical Assistance (Tunis) for forensic urinalysis. Drugs screening was carried out by immunochemical methods. Positive samples were analyzed with gas chromatography coupled to mass selective detector (GC-MS) for confirmation. Results: the investigation revealed that drug users were mainly males 97.4% (sex ratio 37), the median age was 29 ± 7.91 years, 91.3% were singles and 79% were daily workers. On a total of 11170 urine samples screened, 5 409 (48.4%) were positives for illicit drugs. The prevalence of positive samples was 55.4% in 2016; 50.45% in 2017 and 40.8% in 2018. Cannabis was the most widely consumed drug (95%), followed by Benzodiazepines (1.2%), Buprenorphine (1%), cocaine (0.95%), MDMA (0.24%) and opiates (0.13%). Polydrug abuse was observed in 79 specimens (1.5%). Conclusion: this study provides an overview of the illicit drug consumption in the north of Tunisia (knowing that nowadays epidemiological data are almost same since 2016) in order to set up an effective policy to fight against drugs and addictive behaviors and to provide health professionals with the epidemiological elements necessary for better medical care of drug users.",0,"[0.9768126010894775, 0.02318742498755455]",1
3740,"Evaluation of Monitoring Schemes for Wastewater-Based Epidemiology to Identify Drug Use Trends Using Cocaine, Methamphetamine, MDMA and Methadone.^
Wastewater-based epidemiology is increasingly being used as a tool to monitor drug use trends. To minimize costs, studies have typically monitored a small number of days. However, cycles of drug use may display weekly and seasonal trends that affect the accuracy of monthly or annual drug use estimates based on a limited number of samples. This study aimed to rationalize sampling methods for minimizing the number of samples required while maximizing information about temporal trends. A range of sampling strategies were examined: (i) targeted days (e.g., weekends), (ii) completely random or stratified random sampling, and (iii) a number of sampling strategies informed by known weekly cycles in drug use data. Using a time-series approach, analysis was performed for four drugs (MDMA, methamphetamine, cocaine, methadone) collected through a continuous sampling program over 14 months. Results showed, for drugs with weekly cycles (MDMA, methamphetamine and cocaine in this sample), sampling strategies which made use of those weekly cycles required fewer samples to obtain similar information as sampling 5 days per week and had better accuracy than stratified random sampling techniques.",0,"[0.9828690886497498, 0.017130941152572632]",0
273,"Does drug use affect the efficacy of amisulpride, aripiprazole and olanzapine in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders? Results from a pragmatic, randomised study.^
OBJECTIVES: Drug use is prevalent in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) but there is limited knowledge about the influence of drug use on the effectiveness of antipsychotic medication. This secondary explorative study compared the effectiveness of three antipsychotics in patients with SSD, with and without drug use. METHODS: The BeSt InTro multi-centre, head to head, rater-blinded randomised study compared amisulpride, aripiprazole and olanzapine over a 1-year follow-up period. All patients (n = 144) were aged ≥18 years and met the ICD-10 criteria for SSD (F20-29). Clinical symptoms were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The primary outcome was reduction of a PANSS positive subscale score. RESULTS: At baseline, 38% of all patients reported drug use in the last 6 months before inclusion, with cannabis as the main drug (85%), followed by amphetamine-type stimulants (45%), sedatives (26%), hallucinogens (19%), cocaine (13%), opiates (4%), GHB (4%), solvents (4%), analgesics (4%) and anabolic steroids (2%). The predominant pattern was the use of several drugs. There were no significant overall differences in the PANSS positive subscale score reduction for the three studied antipsychotics among patients either with or without drug use. In the drug use group, older patients treated with amisulpride showed a greater PANSS positive subscale score reduction during the treatment period compared to younger patients. CONCLUSION: The current study showed that drug use does not appear to affect the overall effectiveness of amisulpride, aripiprazole and olanzapine in patients with SSD. However, amisulpride may be a particularly suitable choice for older patients with drug use.",0,"[0.98139488697052, 0.01860518380999565]",0
924,"Different likelihood ratio approaches to evaluate the strength of evidence of MDMA tablet comparisons.^
Two likelihood ratio (LR) approaches are presented to evaluate the strength of evidence of MDMA tablet comparisons. The first one is based on a more 'traditional' comparison of MDMA tablets by using distance measures (e.g., Pearson correlation distance or a Euclidean distance). In this approach, LRs are calculated using the distribution of distances between tablets of the same-batch and that of different-batches. The second approach is based on methods used in some other fields of forensic comparison. Here LRs are calculated based on the distribution of values of MDMA tablet characteristics within a specific batch and from all batches. The data used in this paper must be seen as examples to illustrate both methods. In future research the methods can be applied to other and more complex data. In this paper, the methods and their results are discussed, considering their performance in evidence evaluation and several practical aspects. With respect to evidence in favor of the correct hypothesis, the second method proved to be better than the first one. It is shown that the LRs in same-batch comparisons are generally higher compared to the first method and the LRs in different-batch comparisons are generally lower. On the other hand, for operational purposes (where quick information is needed), the first method may be preferred, because it is less time consuming. With this method a model has to be estimated only once in a while, which means that only a few measurements have to be done, while with the second method more measurements are needed because each time a new model has to be estimated. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

5740,"Diversity inclusion in clinical trials investigating esketamine for depression: A systematic review.^
Individuals of varying backgrounds may respond differently to pharmacological interventions for depression. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved the drug, esketamine, for adults with treatment-resistant depression. The current systematic review was executed to assess diversity inclusion in clinical trials for esketamine. Pubmed and Embase were searched according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, and the systematic review yielded 11 final studies. All resultant studies reported female inclusion, 10 studies (91%) reported partial racial and ethnic inclusion, two studies (18%) reported socioeconomic factors, five studies (45%) executed subgroup analyses, and two studies (18%) addressed diversity in their limitations. Females were generally well represented, whereas non-White and Hispanic/Latinx participants were consistently underrepresented. Socioeconomic representation could not be assessed due to underreporting of this factor. Overall, the present review reports on the representation of various demographic subgroups in clinical trials for esketamine in depression and offers suggestions for future research.

3296,"Clarithromycin, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A, greatly increases exposure to oral S-ketamine.^
Background: Oral ketamine is used as an adjuvant in the treatment of refractory neuropathic and cancer-related pain. Drug interactions may alter the analgesic or other effects of ketamine. Aim and methods: The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of cytochrome P450 3A enzyme inhibition with clarithromycin on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral S-ketamine in a randomized controlled cross-over study with two phases. Ten healthy subjects were pre-treated with oral clarithromycin or placebo for 4 days. On day 4, they ingested an oral dose of 0.2 mg/kg of S-ketamine syrup. Plasma concentrations of ketamine and norketamine were measured for 24 h. Analgesic effects were evaluated in a cold pressor test and psychomotor effects were followed for 12 h. Results: Clarithromycin increased the mean Cmax of ketamine by 3.6-fold (p < 0.001) and the mean AUC0–1 of ketamine by 2.6-fold (p = 0.001). The relative amount of the CYP3A dependent metabolite norketamine was decreased by 54% by clarithromycin (p = 0.004). Self-rated drug effect of S-ketamine was enhanced by clarithromycin (p < 0.05) but other behavioral effects or cold pain scores were not affected. Conclusions: Clarithromycin strongly increases plasma concentrations of oral S-ketamine probably by inhibiting its CYP3A-mediated N-demethylation. This increase is reflected as modest changes in behavioral effects of oral S-ketamine. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",1,"[0.008582279086112976, 0.991417646408081]",1

This study aimed to explore the effect of prophylactic ketamine administration on postpartum depression in Chinese woman undergoing cesarean section. This randomized controlled study included 654 Chinese women undergoing cesarean section. At 10 min after child birth, patients in the ketamine group were given 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, whereas patients in the control group received standard postpartum care. At the end of operation, all patients were armed with a patient-controlled intravenous analgesia device. The primary outcome was the prevalence of postpartum depression (PPD), as assessed by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and the secondary outcomes included the safety assessment and the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) of postoperative pain. The prevalence of postpartum blues and postpartum depression were significantly lower in the ketamine group than in the control group. Logistic analysis showed that ketamine administration protected against postpartum depression, and PPD-associated risk factors included stress during pregnancy, antenatal depressive symptom and antenatal suicidal ideation. In addition, the antidepressive effect of prophylactic ketamine was stronger in mothers with a history of moderate stress during pregnancy, antenatal depressive symptom and antenatal suicidal ideation.

1097,"Can the severity of dependence scale be usefully applied to 'ecstasy'?.^
Background/Aims: Although use of 'ecstasy' (drugs sold as containing 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) is prevalent, it is typically infrequent, and treatment presentations involving ecstasy as a principal problem drug are relatively rare. Human case reports and animal literature suggest dependence potential, although there may be some unique aspects to this syndrome for ecstasy in comparison to other substances. The Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS) was examined to determine whether this could usefully identify 'dependent' ecstasy consumers. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 1,658 frequent (at least monthly) ecstasy consumers across Australia, assessing drug use, associated harms and risk behaviours. Dependence was evaluated with the SDS, using a cut-off of ≥4 to identify potential 'dependence'. Results: One fifth of the participants were screened as potentially dependent. These individuals used ecstasy more frequently, in greater amounts, engaged more extensively in risk behaviours and reported greater role interference than other participants. These findings were independent of methamphetamine use or dependence. The underlying structure of the ecstasy SDS was bifactorial. Conclusions: The SDS has demonstrated construct validity as a screening tool to identify ecstasy users at elevated risk of experiencing adverse consequences, including features of dependence. The underlying structure of dependence symptoms differs for ecstasy compared to other drug classes, and some dependent consumers use the drug infrequently. The unique neurotoxic potential and entactogenic effects of ecstasy may require a distinct nosological classification for the experience of dependence associated with the drug. Copyright © 2009 S.

6604,"[Immunomodulator properties of ecstasy (MDMA)].^
In vitro exposure to ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA) alters some immune parameters such as T-cell regulatory function, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity, natural killer cell activity and macrophage function. Administration of MDMA in rats produces a suppression of lympho-proliferation response and a decrease in circulating lymphocytes, accompanied by an increase in plasma corticosterone. It was postulated a direct action of MDMA on lymphocytes or rather an indirect action mediated by the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis (HPA-AXIS) and/or the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Acute MDMA treatment effected on healthy-volunteers produces an immune dysfunction associated with pharmaceutical characteristics and so with MDMA plasma concentrations. There is a decrease in CD4+ T-cells and functional responsiveness of lymphocytes, while percentage of natural killer cells increases. A contemporary rise of cortisol plasma concentrations supports the hypothesis of MDMA-induced release of corticotrophin-releasing factor from the hypothalamus and subsequent HPA-axis and SNS activation.",0,"[0.9899472594261169, 0.01005279179662466]",0

2946,"Investigating sex differences in acute intoxication and verbal memory errors after ad libitum cannabis concentrate use.^
BACKGROUND: An innovative naturalistic at-home administration procedure was used to investigate sex differences in subjective drug effects and verbal memory errors after ad libitum use of high potency state legal market Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) concentrate. METHODS: Regular concentrate users were randomly assigned to ad libitum administration of one of two cannabis concentrate products (70 % or 90 % THC) that they purchased from a dispensary. 65 participants (N = 34 men, N = 31 women) were assessed in a mobile pharmacology lab before, immediately after, and 1 -h after ad libitum concentrate use. Plasma cannabinoids (THC, 11-OH-THC, CBD), subjective drug effects, and verbal memory errors were assessed at all three time points. RESULTS: Although men and women exhibited similar plasma 11-OH-THC levels across time (p = .10), sex differences were found in plasma THC and CBD after legal market concentrate use, with men displaying significantly higher levels of plasma THC and CBD immediately after cannabis concentrate use (plasma THC [ng/mL]: M(men) = 489.88, M(women) = 135.08, p < .001; plasma CBD [ng/mL]: M(men) = 1.14, M(women) = 0.53, p = .04). Despite this, sex differences in subjective effects and verbal memory errors did not emerge, although women reported a steeper decrease in drug liking after use (p = .04). CONCLUSION: These data provide the first look at sex differences after acute naturalistic cannabis concentrate use, and suggest much higher THC exposure in men versus women, but similar acute drug and impairment effects across the sexes. Further studies are needed to determine the mechanisms (e.g. tolerance, cannabinoid metabolism, smoking topography) behind these findings.",0,"[0.982812225818634, 0.017187830060720444]",0

Recent research found lasting increases in personality trait Openness in healthy individuals and patients after administration of the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT(2A) R) agonist psilocybin. However, no studies have investigated whether 5-HT(2A) R availability as imaged using positron emission tomography (PET) is associated with this trait. In 159 healthy individuals (53 females), the association between 5-HT(2A) R binding in neocortex imaged with [(18) F]altanserin or [(11) C]Cimbi-36 PET and personality trait Openness was investigated using linear regression models. In these models the influence of sex on the association was also investigated. Trait Openness was assessed with the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised. No significant associations between neocortical 5-HT(2A) R binding and trait Openness were found for [(18) F]altanserin (p = 0.5) or [(11) C]Cimbi-36 (p = 0.8). Pooling the data in a combined model did not substantially change our results (p = 0.4). No significant interactions with sex were found (p > 0.35). Our results indicate that differences in 5-HT(2A) R availability are not related to variations in trait Openness in healthy individuals.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize adolescent drug use in terms of a risk continuum and to explore the rationale for harm reduction as a potential approach for school-based drug prevention. DESIGN: Self-reported surveys, in 1991 and 1996, of adolescent students concerning their use of drugs, especially alcohol, tobacco and cannabis, and the harmful consequences of such use. SETTING: Nova Scotia. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 3452 (in 1991) and 3790 (in 1996) junior and high school students in randomly selected classes in the public school system. OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of drug use and patterns of multiple drug use and of alcohol- and drug-related problems; independent risk factors for multiple drug use. The risk continuum for the response to alcohol problems was used as a policy framework. RESULTS: The prevalence of cigarette smoking and the use of hallucinogens and stimulants was markedly higher in 1996 than in 1991. Over one-fifth (21.9%) of the students reported multiple drug use of alcohol and tobacco and cannabis in the 12 months before the 1996 survey. The 3 main subgroups--nonusers, users of alcohol only and users of multiple drugs--had distinct patterns of use, numbers of problems and risk factors. In all, 27.1% of the students had experienced at least 1 alcohol-related problem and 6% had experienced at least 1 drug-related problem in the 12 months before the 1996 survey.

8937,"Comparing ecstasy users and non-users in a population-based and co-twin control design across multiple traits.^
Objective: Ecstasy is one of the most commonly used illicit substances in Western countries. The aim of this study is to identify characteristics of ecstasy users in a large population-based sample of adults aged 18–45 years. Method: With generalized estimating equation models we explored the association between self-reported lifetime ecstasy use and urbanicity, educational attainment, health, wellbeing, stress, other substance use, personality traits and psychopathology in a Dutch twin sample (N = 9578, 66.8% female, 18–45 years). We also explored the nature of the association (underlying genetic factors, shared environmental factors or a causal relationship) with the co-twin control method. Results: Lifetime ecstasy users (N = 945, 9.9%) were more often male, younger, living more often in urban areas, higher educated, less satisfied with life and more stressed than non-users. Ecstasy users scored differently on most personality and psychopathology scales compared to non-users and were more likely to have used every other substance we investigated. Whereas smoking tobacco and alcohol use often preceded first use of ecstasy, first ecstasy use often preceded first use of other illicit substances. A combination of scenarios (both causal and environmental/genetic) explained the strong associations between ecstasy and substance use. Conclusions: Ecstasy users differ on many characteristics from non-users, and especially on illicit substance use. Our results indicate that causal effects may play a role in explaining the relationship between ecstasy use and other illicit substance use.",1,"[0.0029464580584317446, 0.9970535039901733]",1

Suicide accounts for approximately 800,000 deaths per year globally. Previous research has shown that intranasal esketamine and intravenous ketamine can rapidly decrease the severity of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation. However, the majority of clinical trials excluded individuals with moderate to high baseline suicidality scores (e.g., suicidal ideation with plan/intent at the time of recruitment). The current review aims to evaluate the effect of esketamine and ketamine in patients with suicidal ideation at baseline. A systematic search was conducted on EMBASE, PsychInfo and PubMed from inception to July 2020 following the PRISMA guidelines. 15 studies met inclusion criteria. Results from esketamine trials did not demonstrate antisuicidal effects, as between-group differences were not found. Intravenous ketamine appeared to rapidly decrease the severity of suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms in individuals with baseline suicidal ideation, though retrospective studies suggest that these effects may be short-lasting. During the double-blind treatment phases, 2.4% of patients from the treatment groups and 1.5% of patients from control groups attempted suicide, with zero deaths by suicide in both the treatment and control groups during this phase. Based on the overall pooled samples, studies were assessed to be relatively safe, and the continual inclusion of this study population in future clinical trials is encouraged.

4507,"Dreamlike effects of LSD on waking imagery in humans depend on serotonin 2A receptor activation.^
RATIONALE: Accumulating evidence indicates that the mixed serotonin and dopamine receptor agonist lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) induces an altered state of consciousness that resembles dreaming. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to test the hypotheses that LSD produces dreamlike waking imagery and that this imagery depends on 5-HT2A receptor activation and is related to subjective drug effects. METHODS: Twenty-five healthy subjects performed an audiorecorded guided mental imagery task 7 h after drug administration during three drug conditions: placebo, LSD (100 mcg orally) and LSD together with the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin (40 mg orally). Cognitive bizarreness of guided mental imagery reports was quantified as a standardised formal measure of dream mentation. State of consciousness was evaluated using the Altered State of Consciousness (5D-ASC) questionnaire. RESULTS: LSD, compared with placebo, significantly increased cognitive bizarreness (p < 0.001). The LSD-induced increase in cognitive bizarreness was positively correlated with the LSD-induced loss of self-boundaries and cognitive control (p < 0.05). Both LSD-induced increases in cognitive bizarreness and changes in state of consciousness were fully blocked by ketanserin. CONCLUSIONS: LSD produced mental imagery similar to dreaming, primarily via activation of the 5-HT2A receptor and in relation to loss of self-boundaries and cognitive control. Future psychopharmacological studies should assess the differential contribution of the D2/D1 and 5-HT1A receptors to cognitive bizarreness.",1,"[0.0024910056963562965, 0.9975090026855469]",1

Reported risk behaviors and health consequences did not differ by assessment modality. Adjusted HLM analyses showed a significant main effect of assigned condition on all outcomes. CAPI participants had greater reductions in drug use, risky sex, mental distress and substance dependence symptoms, and greater increases in abstinence, compared to ACASI intervention or control participants at 12months, except that the CAPI and ACASI conditions had similar efficacy for reductions in drug use. Effect sizes for CAPI versus ACASI participants were d=0.2‐0.3, and between CAPI and controls d=0.2‐0.4. Effect sizes for improved outcomes between ACASI compared to controls were small to non‐significant. CONCLUSIONS: The study established the therapeutic benefit of interviewer interaction in reducing risky behavior among this young drug using population. The study demonstrated the efficacy and acceptability of a low threshold intervention in reducing drug use, sexual risk and related co‐morbidities among a not‐in‐treatment young adult population that exhibits severe and complex levels of drug use, but that is also highly resistant to intervention.",0,"[0.9837732315063477, 0.016226723790168762]",0
2181,"Incidence of Intoxications in the Emergency Department of Galati Hospital with Examples of Cardiovascular Effects of MDMA Intoxication.^
MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine; commonly referred to as “Molly” or “ecstasy”) is a synthetic compound, structurally and pharmacologically similar to both amphetamines and mescaline. MDMA differs somewhat from traditional amphetamines in that it is not structurally similar to serotonin. Cocaine is rare and cannabis is consumed less frequently than in Western Europe. Heroin is the drug of choice for the poor in Bucharest, Romania’s capital of two million people, and alcoholism is common in villages where more than a third of the population lives in poverty. By far, the most popular drugs are Legal Highs (Romanians call them “ethnobotanics”). All of these drugs have significant effects on cardiovascular function that contribute significantly to adverse events. Most adverse cardiac events occur in young adults and are potentially reversible. Poisoning among patients aged 17 years and over was commonly seen in the Emergency Departments of a large tertiary hospital in the city centre, accounting for 3.2% of all patients. In a third of the poisonings, more than one substance was used. Intoxication with ethnobotanicals was the most frequently observed, followed by use of drugs from the amphetamine group. The majority of patients presenting to the Emergency Department were male. Therefore, this study suggests further research on hazardous alcohol consumption and drug abuse.",0,"[0.9763059020042419, 0.023694047704339027]",1
2719,"Body Mass Index as a Moderator of Treatment Response to Ketamine for Major Depressive Disorder.^
PURPOSE/BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) and obesity commonly co-occur. We sought to assess the impact of body mass index (BMI) on the acute antidepressant effects of ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant depression. METHODS/PROCEDURES: Post hoc analyses were conducted from a multisite, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to assess the rapid-onset effects of intravenous ketamine. Patients (n = 99) were randomized to a single dose administration of ketamine 0.1 mg/kg (n = 18), ketamine 0.2 mg/kg (n = 20), ketamine 0.5 mg/kg (n = 22), ketamine 1.0 mg/kg (n = 20), or active placebo, midazolam 0.045 mg/kg (n = 19). Patients were stratified for BMI. For patients randomized to ketamine (n = 80), BMI was assessed as a continuous variable and also categorically (obese, overweight, not obese/overweight [reference]). The primary outcome measure was the change on the 6-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 24 hours after treatment. Outcomes at day 3 were also assessed. FINDINGS/RESULTS: The 6-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale change scores at 24 hours were inversely associated with BMI (-0.28 ± 0.12, P = 0.02). With BMI operationalized categorically, both obese (-4.15 ± 1.41, P = 0.004) and overweight (-1.99 ± 1.14, P = 0.08) categories were inversely related to the 6-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale change score at 24 hours, statistically significant for the obese category, as compared with the reference group. Similar but weaker findings were observed at 72 hours after infusion. IMPLICATIONS/CONCLUSIONS: Higher BMI and obesity were associated with a more robust acute antidepressant response to ketamine. This may have clinical relevance for a great number of patients who have both MDD and obesity. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01920555.",1,"[0.002439434640109539, 0.9975605010986328]",1

3175,"Survey of subjective ""God encounter experiences"": Comparisons among naturally occurring experiences and those occasioned by the classic psychedelics psilocybin, LSD, ayahuasca, or DMT.^
Naturally occurring and psychedelic drug–occasioned experiences interpreted as personal encounters with God are well described but have not been systematically compared. In this study, five groups of individuals participated in an online survey with detailed questions characterizing the subjective phenomena, interpretation, and persisting changes attributed to their single most memorable God encounter experience (n = 809 Non-Drug, 1184 psilocybin, 1251 lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), 435 ayahuasca, and 606 N,N-dimethyltrypta-mine (DMT)). Analyses of differences in experiences were adjusted statistically for demographic differences between groups. The Non-Drug Group was most likely to choose ""God"" as the best descriptor of that which was encountered while the psychedelic groups were most likely to choose ""Ultimate Reality."" Although there were some other differences between non-drug and the combined psychedelic group, as well as between the four psychedelic groups, the similarities among these groups were most striking. Most participants reported vivid memories of the encounter experience, which frequently involved communication with something having the attributes of being conscious, benevolent, intelligent, sacred, eternal, and all-knowing. The encounter experience fulfilled a priori criteria for being a complete mystical experience in approximately half of the participants. More than two-thirds of those who identified as atheist before the experience no longer identified as atheist afterwards. These experiences were rated as among the most personally meaningful and spiritually significant lifetime experiences, with moderate to strong persisting positive changes in life satisfaction, purpose, and meaning attributed to these experiences. Among the four groups of psychedelic users, the psilocybin and LSD groups were most similar and the ayahuasca group tended to have the highest rates of endorsing positive features and enduring consequences of the experience. Future exploration of predisposing factors and phenomenological and neural correlates of such experiences may provide new insights into religious and spiritual beliefs that have been integral to shaping human culture since time immemorial.",1,"[0.0044230311177670956, 0.9955769777297974]",1
343,"Maternal Multiple Sclerosis and Health Outcomes Among the Children: A Systematic Review.^
OBJECTIVE: To summarize the available literature and provide an overview of in utero exposure to maternal multiple sclerosis (MS) and the influence on offspring health outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review by searching Embase, Medline and PubMed.gov databases, and we used covidence.org to conduct a thorough sorting of the articles into three groups; 1) women with MS and the influence on birth outcomes; 2) women with MS treated with disease-modifying therapy (DMT) during pregnancy and the influence on birth outcomes; and 3) women with MS and the influence on long-term health outcomes in the children. RESULTS: In total, 22 cohort studies were identified. Ten studies reported on MS without DMT and compared with a control group without MS, and nine studies on women with MS and DMT prior to or during pregnancy met the criteria. We found only four studies reporting on long-term child health outcomes. One study had results belonging to more than one group. CONCLUSION: The studies pointed towards an increased risk of preterm birth and small for gestational age among women with MS. In terms of women with MS treated with DMT prior to or during pregnancy, no clear conclusions could be reached. The few studies on long-term child outcomes all had different outcomes within the areas of neurodevelopment and psychiatric impairment.

7289,"Retrospective suspect and non-target screening combined with similarity measures to prioritize MDMA and amphetamine synthesis markers in wastewater.^
3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and amphetamine are commonly used psychoactive stimulants. Illegal manufacture of these substances, mainly located in the Netherlands and Belgium, generates large amounts of chemical waste which is disposed in the environment or released in sewer systems. Retrospective analysis of high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) data was implemented to detect synthesis markers of MDMA and amphetamine production in wastewater samples. Specifically, suspect and non-target screening, combined with a prioritization approach based on similarity measures between detected features and mass loads of MDMA and amphetamine was implemented. Two hundred and thirty-five 24 h-composite wastewater samples collected from a treatment plant in the Netherlands between 2016 and 2018 were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry. Samples were initially separated into two groups (i.e., baseline consumption versus dumping) based on daily loads of MDMA and amphetamine. Significance testing and fold-changes were used to find differences between features in the two groups. Then, associations between peak areas of all features and MDMA or amphetamine loads were investigated across the whole time series using various measures (Euclidian distance, Pearson's correlation coefficient, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, distance correlation and maximum information coefficient). This unsupervised and unbiased approach was used for prioritization of features and allowed the selection of 28 presumed markers of production of MDMA and amphetamine. These markers could potentially be used to detect dumps in sewer systems, help in determining the synthesis route and track down the waste in the environment.",1,"[0.1973533034324646, 0.8026466369628906]",0
1256,"Therapeutic Potential of Psilocybin for Treating Psychological Distress among Survivors of Adverse Childhood Experiences: Evidence on Acceptability and Potential Efficacy of Psilocybin Use.^
Survivors of adverse childhood experience are at elevated risk for psychological distress. In recent years, renewed interest in psychedelic medicine has highlighted the therapeutic potential of psilocybin for those who have experienced childhood adversity. However, recreational psilocybin use remains illegal and access to approved therapies is difficult. Such use provides an opportunity to explore the therapeutic potential of psilocybin for psychological distress among people with adverse childhood experiences. Therefore, we conducted an online survey to assess interest in, acceptability of, and experiences with psilocybin. We further explored whether the association between Adverse Childhood Experiences Questionnaire (ACEQ) scores and psychological distress was lower among those who had used psilocybin in the past three months. Results showed high levels of interest in and acceptability of psilocybin that did not differ across ACEQ scores. Results also showed that the effect of adverse childhood experiences on psychological distress was lower for people who had recently used psilocybin (p =.019). Taken together, these findings suggest that psilocybin therapy may be potentially acceptable and may feasibly help in supporting survivors of adverse childhood experiences with particularly strong benefits to those with more severe childhood adversity.",1,"[0.005372002255171537, 0.9946280121803284]",1
8431,"Increased Global Functional Connectivity Correlates with LSD-Induced Ego Dissolution.^
Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a non-selective serotonin-receptor agonist that was first synthesized in 1938 and identified as (potently) psychoactive in 1943. Psychedelics have been used by indigenous cultures for millennia [1]; however, because of LSD's unique potency and the timing of its discovery (coinciding with a period of major discovery in psychopharmacology), it is generally regarded as the quintessential contemporary psychedelic [2]. LSD has profound modulatory effects on consciousness and was used extensively in psychological research and psychiatric practice in the 1950s and 1960s [3]. In spite of this, however, there have been no modern human imaging studies of its acute effects on the brain. Here we studied the effects of LSD on intrinsic functional connectivity within the human brain using fMRI. High-level association cortices (partially overlapping with the default-mode, salience, and frontoparietal attention networks) and the thalamus showed increased global connectivity under the drug. The cortical areas showing increased global connectivity overlapped significantly with a map of serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptor densities (the key site of action of psychedelic drugs [4]). LSD also increased global integration by inflating the level of communication between normally distinct brain networks. The increase in global connectivity observed under LSD correlated with subjective reports of ""ego dissolution."" The present results provide the first evidence that LSD selectively expands global connectivity in the brain, compromising the brain's modular and ""rich-club"" organization and, simultaneously, the perceptual boundaries between the self and the environment.",1,"[0.004328619688749313, 0.9956713914871216]",1
6592,"Effects of low-dose propofol vs ketamine on emergence cough in children undergoing flexible bronchoscopy with sevoflurane-remifentanil anesthesia: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.^
STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of low-dose ketamine and propofol on cough during emergence and the recovery period when administered at emergence in children undergoing fiberoptic bronchoscopy for bronchoalveolar lavage (FOBL) with sevoflurane-remifentanil anesthesia. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Operating room, postoperative recovery area. PATIENTS: Sixty-eight children aged 1 to 8 years old undergoing elective diagnostic FOBL. INTERVENTIONS: After discontinuation of anesthetics at the end of FOBL, patients were randomly divided into 3 groups: in group K, children were administered 0.5 mg/kg of ketamine; in group P, 0.5 mg/kg of propofol; and in group C, 0.1 mL/kg of normal saline. MEASUREMENTS: Anesthesia time, procedure time, emergence time, and recovery time were recorded. Coughing and delirium scores were recorded as the patient fully emerged from anesthesia (time 0) and 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes later. MAIN RESULTS: The percentage of children with moderate or severe cough during emergence was similar in all groups. Mean delirium scores at emergence (T0) were significantly lower in group K than those in group P and in group C (P = .0001 and P = .02). Mean delirium score at 5 minutes in group K (6 [5-10]) was significantly lower than that of group C (P = .02) and similar to that of group P. The recovery time of group K was significantly longer than that of group C and group P (P = .01 and P = .03, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine or propofol given at the end of sevoflurane-remifentanil general anesthesia in children undergoing FOBL did not decrease cough more than normal saline during the emergence period. Ketamine and propofol, compared to normal saline, had a beneficial effect on decreasing the incidence of emergence delirium.

825,"Impairment of inhibitory control processing related to acute psychotomimetic effects of cannabis.^
Cannabis use can induce acute psychotic symptoms and increase the risk of schizophrenia. Impairments in inhibitory control and processing are known to occur both under the influence of cannabis and in schizophrenia. Whether cannabis-induced impairment in inhibitory processing is related to the acute induction of psychotic symptoms under its influence is unclear. We investigated the effects of acute oral administration of 10mg of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC), the main psychoactive ingredient of cannabis, on inhibitory control and regional brain activation during inhibitory processing in humans and examined whether these effects are related to the induction of psychotic symptoms under its influence using a repeated-measures, placebo-controlled, double-blind, within-subject design. We studied thirty-six healthy, English-speaking, right-handed men with minimal previous exposure to cannabis and other illicit drugs twice using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while they performed a response inhibition (Go/No-Go) task. Relative to placebo, delta-9-THC caused transient psychotic symptoms, anxiety, intoxication and sedation, inhibition errors and impaired inhibition efficiency. Severity of psychotic symptoms was directly correlated with inhibition error frequency and inversely with inhibition efficiency under the influence of delta-9-THC. Delta-9-THC attenuated left inferior frontal activation which was inversely correlated with the frequency of inhibition errors and severity of psychotic symptoms and positively with inhibition efficiency under its influence. These results provide experimental evidence that impairments in cognitive processes involved in the inhibitory control of thoughts and actions and inferior frontal function under the influence of cannabis may have a role in the emergence of transient psychotic symptoms under its influence.",0,"[0.9911695718765259, 0.008830461651086807]",0
7367,"Differences in prefrontal blood oxygenation during an acute multitasking stressor in ecstasy polydrug users.^
BACKGROUND: Cognitive deficits are well documented in ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine; MDMA) users, with such deficits being taken as evidence of dysregulation of the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) system. More recently neuroimaging has been used to corroborate these deficits. The present study aimed to assess multitasking performance in ecstasy polydrug users, polydrug users and drug-naive individuals. It was predicted that ecstasy polydrug users would perform worse than non-users on the behavioural measure and this would be supported by differences in cortical blood oxygenation. METHOD: In the study, 20 ecstasy-polydrug users, 17 polydrug users and 19 drug-naive individuals took part. On day 1, drug use history was taken and questionnaire measures were completed. On day 2, participants completed a 20-min multitasking stressor while brain blood oxygenation was measured using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the three groups on the subscales of the multitasking stressor. In addition, there were no significant differences on self-report measures of perceived workload (NASA Task Load Index). In terms of mood, ecstasy users were significantly less calm and less relaxed compared with drug-naive controls. There were also significant differences at three voxels on the fNIRS, indicating decreased blood oxygenation in ecstasy users compared with drug-naive controls at voxel 2 (left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), voxel 14 and voxel 16 (right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), and compared with polydrug controls at V14. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study provide support for changes in brain activation during performance of demanding tasks in ecstasy polydrug users, which could be related to cerebral vasoconstriction.",1,"[0.0026132354978471994, 0.9973867535591125]",1
3276,"(PO-065) High-utilization, Hospitalized Patients with Alcohol Use Disorder: initial RCT Participant Characteristics and Correlations.^
Background/Significance: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) impacts 15 million Americans leading to 5 million annual emergency department (ED) visits and 2 million admissions (White et al., 2018). Hospitalization is a vital opportunity to intervene, and two pharmacologic interventions given before discharge may be effective at reducing re‐admissions. Little is known about the AUD population willing and able to be randomized in this setting. Methods: Our open‐label, pilot trial (target n=45‐60) randomizes participants to 1) extended‐release naltrexone injection, 2) intravenous ketamine infusion, or 3) enhanced‐linkage alone. Adult, hospitalized participants with severe AUD and at least one past‐year admission are recruited through addiction consultation at an urban, safety‐net hospital. Demographics, adverse childhood experiences (ACE), Timeline Follow Back drinking history (TLFB), and depressive symptoms (PHQ‐9) are recorded at baseline. For this abstract, we present participant characteristics and explore correlations (Pearson r coefficient) between multiple scales of interest and hospital utilization. IRB approval obtained. Results: Among 32 complete participants, demographics are: mean age 45, 75% male, 56.25% Caucasian, 34.4% not stably housed. They on average had 13 past‐year ED visits, with 5 hospitalizations. Clinical characteristic means are: 12.14 daily drinks, PHQ‐9 score 13.2 (of 27), ACE score 4.16 (of 10), and DSM5 criteria total 9.5 (of 11) for AUD. Daily drinks was significantly correlated with hospitalizations (r = 0.517, p=0.0029) as well as ED visits (r = 0.372, p=0.039). ED utilization was also significantly higher for homeless/unstably housed individuals vs stably housed individuals (t(28)= 4.025, p=0.00039). Discussion: This safety‐net hospital, AUD‐research population is high acuity regarding addiction/psychiatric state, housing status, and hospital utilization. Modest correlations observed between daily drinks and depression symptoms with acute care utilization, respectively, are limited by sample size. This population differs from other studies involving ketamine and naltrexone for AUD. For example, in Dakwar et al. (2019), ketamine participants consumed 6.6 daily drinks and had minimal depressive symptoms. In Bryson et al. (2011), XR naltrexone patients had 0.75 ED visits per half‐year. Conclusion: Trial recruitment appears feasible among a unique, high‐utilization sample of hospitalized patients with AUD. Trial results may expand the inpatient toolkit of treatments for this pervasive disease. References: 1. Bryson WC, McConnell KJ, Korthuis PT, et al (2011).

Half of the participants were asked an image induction question containing the construct of open-mindedness. Results indicate that brief educational materials of about 300 words significantly increased perceived treatment credibility for both therapies, with a large effect size (Cohen’s d = .91). The use of an image induction prime further increased perceived credibility for psilocybin-assisted therapy for depression (Cohen’s d = .38).

METHODS: In this proof-of-concept randomized, double-blind, single-dose crossover clinical trial, 17 adolescents (ages 13-17) with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder received a single intravenous infusion of either ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes) or midazolam (0.045 mg/kg over 40 minutes), and the alternate compound 2 weeks later. All participants had previously tried at least one antidepressant medication and met the severity criterion of a score >40 on the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised. The primary outcome measure was score on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) 24 hours after treatment. RESULTS: A single ketamine infusion significantly reduced depressive symptoms 24 hours after infusion compared with midazolam (MADRS score: midazolam, mean=24.13, SD=12.08, 95% CI=18.21, 30.04; ketamine, mean=15.44, SD=10.07, 95% CI=10.51, 20.37; mean difference=-8.69, SD=15.08, 95% CI=-16.72, -0.65, df=15; effect size=0.78). In secondary analyses, the treatment gains associated with ketamine appeared to remain 14 days after treatment, the latest time point assessed, as measured by the MADRS (but not as measured by the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised). A significantly greater proportion of participants experienced a response to ketamine during the first 3 days following infusion as compared with midazolam (76% and 35%, respectively). Ketamine was associated with transient, self-limited dissociative symptoms that affected participant blinding, but there were no serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In this first randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial of intravenous ketamine in adolescents with depression, the findings suggest that it is well tolerated acutely and has significant short-term (2-week) efficacy in reducing depressive symptoms compared with an active placebo.Reprinted from Am J Psychiatry 2021; 178:352-362 with permission from American Psychiatric Association Publishing.",1,"[0.0023569760378450155, 0.9976430535316467]",1
2787,"Regular MDMA use is associated with decreased risk of drug injection among street-involved youth who use illicit drugs.^
OBJECTIVES: Childhood trauma is common among street-involved youth and is associated with injection drug use. Illicit 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) use is also common among street-involved youth, and data suggest this substance has clinical utility in management of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and associated harms. Despite this, little is known about co-occurring patterns of MDMA use and injection drug use. METHODS: Data were derived from a prospective cohort of street-involved youth using illicit drugs in Vancouver, Canada. Using multivariable generalized estimating equation logistic regression, we examined the association between MDMA use and the use of injection drugs, adjusting for confounders such as polysubstance use and sociodemographic factors. RESULTS: 4941 surveys from 1208 participants between September 2005 and May 2015 were included. Of these, 829 (68.6%) were male, 815 (67.5%) reported white ethnicity, and median age was 21.7 years. Overall, 599 (49.6%) participants reported MDMA use, 544 (45.0%) reported injection drug use, and 244 (20.2%) reported concurrent MDMA and injection drug use at least once during the study period. In multivariable analyses, regular MDMA use was significantly negatively associated with injection drug use (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.46-0.69). DISCUSSION: After accounting for socio-demographic factors and polysubstance use, periods of reported regular MDMA use were negatively associated with reported injection drug use among this cohort. These findings suggest that, unlike the use of most other non-injection drugs, illicit MDMA use does not appear to promote injection drug use but rather is associated with a reduced likelihood of injection drug use.",1,"[0.004270224831998348, 0.9957297444343567]",1
8535,"Mood, cognition and serotonin transporter availability in current and former ecstasy (MDMA) users.^
Rationale: Chronic recreational ecstasy (MDMA) use has often been reported to be associated with psychopathology, memory impairments and serotonergic alterations. However, the findings have not been consistent. Objectives: To attempt to replicate these findings, to investigate whether such alterations would be reversible and whether they could be predicted by parameters of previous drug use. Methods: In a cross-sectional design, 30 current and 31 ex-ecstasy users with ecstasy abstinence of at least 5 months, and 29 polydrug and 30 drug-naive controls were compared on measures of psychopathology, cognitive performance and serotonin transporter availability. Results: The groups did not differ significantly in age, gender distribution, education level and premorbid intelligence. The ecstasy groups did not differ significantly from polydrug controls on most of the relevant parameters of concomitant illegal drug use. Reported drug use was confirmed by hair and urine analyses. All three groups of drug users exhibited significantly elevated psychopathology compared with drug-naive controls. Only ex-ecstasy users were significantly impaired on verbal recall. Current ecstasy users showed significantly reduced distribution volume ratios of serotonin transporter availability in the mesencephalon and caudate nucleus. Regression analyses indicated that psychopathology and serotonergic alterations were best predicted by the number of ecstasy tablets taken on a typical event. Conclusion: The results indicate that verbal memory impairments were possibly aggravated after prolonged ecstasy abstinence while there was tentative evidence of serotonergic recovery. On the other hand, self-reported elevated psychopathology appeared to be associated with polydrug use in general and not specifically with ecstasy use.",1,"[0.0028311859350651503, 0.9971688389778137]",1
3792,"Rapid decrease in depressive symptoms with an N-methyl-d-aspartate antagonist in ECT-resistant major depression.^
BACKGROUND: Ketamine rapidly improves depressive symptoms in patients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD) who do not respond to multiple standard antidepressants. However, it remains unknown whether ketamine is equally effective in patients with MDD who previously also did not respond to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). METHODS: This study compared 17 patients with treatment-resistant MDD who previously did not respond to ECT and 23 patients with treatment-resistant MDD who had not previously received ECT. All subjects received a single open-label infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg). Patients were evaluated using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) at baseline (60 min before the infusion), as well as at 40, 80, 120, and 230 min after infusion. RESULTS: Depressive symptoms were significantly improved in the ECT-resistant group at 230 minutes with a moderate effect size (p < .001, d = 0.50, 95% C.I.: 0.21-0.80). At 230 minutes, the non-ECT exposed group showed significant improvement with a large effect size (p < .001, d=1.00, 95% C.I.: 0.71-1.29). CONCLUSION: Ketamine appears to improve depressive symptoms in patients with MDD who had previously not responded to ECT. These preliminary results encourage further investigation with a larger sample size to determine effectiveness compared to other treatment-resistant patients with MDD.",1,"[0.0026209698989987373, 0.9973790645599365]",1
7417,"Effect of acute brain tyrosine depletion on MDMA-induced changes in brain 5-HT.^
The mechanism by which 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) produces 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) neurotoxicity has been suggested to involve an acute release of tyrosine and its non-enzymatic conversion to dopamine. To determine whether brain tyrosine availability is important in MDMA-induced neurotoxicity, brain tyrosine was acutely depleted with a tyrosine-free amino acid mixture (1 g/kg intraperitoneal; twice 1 h apart) which was administered prior to an injection of MDMA (12.5 mg/kg intraperitoneal). A small increase in both the hippocampal and striatal tyrosine concentration occurred in control rats treated with MDMA. The tyrosine-free amino acid mixture significantly decreased tyrosine levels by more than 50% in both brain regions 2 h after injection of either MDMA or saline. MDMA significantly reduced brain 5-HT content 2 h later, but this was of a similar magnitude in control and tyrosine-depleted groups. The long-term neurotoxic 5-HT loss in the hippocampus induced two weeks after MDMA administration was unaltered by the tyrosine-free amino acid mixture. Striatal dopamine content was unaffected by acute MDMA in all groups, while the tyrosine-free amino acid mixture given with MDMA significantly decreased striatal dopamine content 2 weeks later. The tyrosine-free amino acid mixture given alone had no affect on rectal body temperature but attenuated the duration of MDMA-induced hyperthermia. The results confirmed the ability of systemic MDMA to acutely increase brain tyrosine content, but also indicated that a marked acute reduction of brain tyrosine does not directly affect either immediate 5-HT release (as measured by tissue depletion) or long-term hippocampal serotonergic neurotoxicity produced by MDMA.",0,"[0.9933358430862427, 0.006664182059466839]",0
2278,"Population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling of the psychedelic experience induced by N,N-dimethyltryptamine – Implications for dose considerations.^
N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is a psychedelic compound that is believed to have potential as a therapeutic option in several psychiatric disorders. The number of clinical investigations with DMT is increasing. However, very little is known about the pharmacokinetic properties of DMT as well as any relationship between its exposure and effects. This study aimed to characterize population pharmacokinetics of DMT as well as the relationship between DMT plasma concentrations and its psychedelic effects as measured through subjective intensity ratings. Data were obtained from 13 healthy subjects after intravenous administration of DMT. The data were analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling in NONMEM. DMT plasma concentrations were described by a two-compartment model with first-order elimination leading to formation of the major metabolite indole 3-acetic acid. The relationship between plasma concentrations and psychedelic intensity was described by an effect site compartment model with a sigmoid maximum effect (Emax) response. DMT clearance was estimated at 26 L/min, a high value indicating elimination of DMT to be independent of blood flow. Higher concentrations of DMT were associated with a more intense experience with the concentration of DMT at the effect site required to produce half of the maximum response estimated at 95 nM. The maximum achievable intensity rating was 10 and the simulated median maximum rating was zero, 2, 4, 8, and 9 after doses of 1, 4, 7, 14, and 20 mg, respectively. The model can be useful in predicting suitable doses for clinical investigations of DMT based on the desired intensity of the subjective experience.",1,"[0.0034323071595281363, 0.9965677261352539]",1
3679,"Ecstasy (MDMA) Does Not Have Long-Term Effects on Aggressive Interpretative Bias: A Study Comparing Current and Ex-Ecstasy Users With Polydrug and Drug-Naive Controls.^
±3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy) remains a widely used recreational drug, which, in animals, can produce long-lasting changes to the brain's serotonergic system. As serotonin has been implicated in human aggression, it is possible that ecstasy users are at risk of increased aggression even after prolonged abstention from the drug. The objective of this study was to indirectly assess aggression in current and abstinent ecstasy users using an information-processing paradigm that measures cognitive bias toward material with aggressive content. The task employed has previously shown increased aggressive bias 3-4 days after ecstasy use. An interpretative bias task was administered to 105 male participants: 26 ex-ecstasy users, 25 current ecstasy users, 29 polydrug using controls, and 25 drug-naive controls. Accuracy and response times to process and recognize ambiguous sentences were tested. There were no group differences in aggressive interpretative bias. All 4 groups processed neutral sentences faster than aggressive sentences and were subsequently faster and more confident in recognizing neutral compared with aggressive sentences. Further, self-ratings of aggression also showed no group differences, even though self-rated impulsivity was significantly higher in current ecstasy users than in drug-naive controls. The findings that all groups were biased toward neutral and away from aggressive interpretations of ambiguous sentences add to the existing body of knowledge in suggesting that increased aggression found in ecstasy users a few days after taking the drug is a transient phenomenon and not a long-term, persisting effect. © 2007 American Psychological Association.",1,"[0.0029726431239396334, 0.9970273375511169]",1
3733,"Symptoms of anxiety and depression in childhood and use of MDMA: Prospective, population based study.^
Objective: To investigate whether using ecstasy (3,4- methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA) is preceded by symptoms of behavioural and emotional problems in childhood and early adolescence. Design: Prospective, longitudinal, population based study Setting: The Dutch province of Zuid-Holland. Participants: A sample of 1580 individuals, followed up across a 14 year period, from childhood into adulthood. Main outcome measures: The first assessment took place in 1983 before MDMA appeared as a recreational drug in the Netherlands and included the child behaviour checklist to obtain standardised parents' reports of their children's behavioural and emotional problems. Use of the drug was assessed with the composite international diagnostic interview 14 years later. Results: Eight syndrome scales of childhood behaviour were examined. Scores in the deviant range for the scales designated as anxious or depressed in childhood were significantly related to use of MDMA in adolescents and adults, resulting in an increased risk (hazard ratio 2.22, 95% confidence interval 1.20 to 4.11, P = 0.01). Conclusions: Individuals with childhood symptoms of anxiety and depression may have an increased tendency to use MDMA in adolescence or young adulthood. Its effects are supposed to include enhanced feelings of bonding with other people, euphoria, or relaxation. Especially individuals with symptoms of anxiety or depression may be susceptible to these positive effects.",1,"[0.0038277404382824898, 0.9961722493171692]",1
8731,"Therapeutic effect of an ayahuasca analogue in clinically depressed patients: a longitudinal observational study.^
RATIONALE: Studies have suggested mental health improvements following the use of the psychotropic plant concoction ayahuasca in non-clinical and clinical samples. OBJECTIVES: The present observational study assessed depressive symptomatology in 20 clinically depressed patients (symptom score > 13 on the Beck's Depression Inventory) before attendance of an ayahuasca ceremony and 1 month and 1 year after. Secondary measures included ratings of altered states of consciousness and ego dissolution during the ayahuasca ceremony as well as global measures of mindfulness, satisfaction with life, depression, anxiety, and stress. RESULTS: Twenty participants completed baseline and 1-day follow-up, 19 completed measures at 1-month follow-up, and 17 completed measures at 1-year follow-up. BDI scores reduced from baseline (M = 22.7) to all post-ceremony measures (Ms 11.45, 12.89, and 8.88, for 1-day, 1-month, and 1-year follow-up, respectively). After 1 day, 12/20 participants were in remission (BDI < 13). Remission rates after 1 month and 1 year were 13/19 and 12/17, respectively. Three participants remained mildly depressed (BDI 14-19) at the 1-month and 1-year follow-up. Two participants did not respond and remained at a moderate/severe level of depression at 1-year follow-up. Reductions on the secondary mental health measures and increases in mindfulness and satisfaction with life were found up to 1 year post-ceremony. Improvements in clinical depression and mental health correlated with levels of experienced ego dissolution and oceanic boundlessness during the ceremony up to 1 month after the ceremony. Engagement in additional mental health treatments or use of another psychedelic during study participation may have contributed to improved mental health ratings at 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSION: Ayahuasca produces long-term mental health improvements in clinically depressed patients, which highlights its therapeutic potential.",1,"[0.004221292678266764, 0.9957786798477173]",1
9559,"Simultaneous population pharmacokinetic modelling of ketamine and three major metabolites in patients with treatment-resistant bipolar depression.^
AIM: To construct a population pharmacokinetic (popPK) model for ketamine (Ket), norketamine (norKet), dehydronorketamine (DHNK), hydroxynorketamine (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HNK) and hydroxyketamine (HK) in patients with treatment-resistant bipolar depression. METHOD: Plasma samples were collected at 40, 80, 110, 230 min on day 1, 2 and 3 in nine patients following a 40 min infusion of (R,S)-Ket (0.5 mg kg⁻¹) and analyzed for Ket, norKet and DHNK enantiomers and (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HNK, (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HK and (2S,6R;2R,6S)-HK. A compartmental popPK model was constructed that included all quantified analytes, and unknown parameters were estimated with an iterative two-stage algorithm in ADAPT5. RESULTS: Ket, norKet, DHNK and (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HNK were present during the first 230 min post infusion and significant concentrations (>5 ng ml⁻¹) were observed on day 1. Plasma concentrations of (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HK and (2S,6R;2R,6S)-HK were below the limit of quantification. The average (S) : (R) plasma concentrations for Ket and DHNK were <1.0 while no significant enantioselectivity was observed for norKet. There were large inter-patient variations in terminal half-lives and relative metabolite concentrations; at 230 min (R,S)-DHNK was the major metabolite in four out of nine patients, (R,S)-norKet in three out of nine patients and (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HNK in two out of nine patients. The final PK model included three compartments for (R,S)-Ket, two compartments for (R,S)-norKet and single compartments for DHNK and HNK. All PK profiles were well described, and parameters for (R,S)-Ket and (R,S)-norKet were in agreement with prior estimates. CONCLUSION: This represents the first PK analysis of (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HNK and (R,S)-DHNK. The results demonstrate that while norKet is the initial metabolite, it is not the main metabolite suggesting that future Ket studies should include the analysis of the major metabolites.",1,"[0.0032098116353154182, 0.9967901110649109]",0
590,"Pattern of Drug Use and Depressive Symptoms among Amphetamine Type Stimulants Users in Beijing and Guangdong Province, China.^
Background: In recent years, amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) have increased dramatically in East-south Asia, especially in China. Most ATS users suffered from psychosis comorbidity, and depression is the main syndrome in ATS users. Methodology: A cross-sectional study of depressive symptoms and associated factors among ATS users was conducted in compulsory and voluntary drug detoxification and rehabilitation centers of Beijing and Guangdong Province from March, 2010 to August, 2010. Total 402 eligible participants were recruited and investigated by trained interviewers using a structured questionnaire, the depression was measured by the short 13-item Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-13). Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the impact of associated risk factors of depressive symptoms (%≥8). Principle Finding: The mean score of BDI-13 is 8.11, and 169 participants (42.04%) have depressive symptoms, including 106 (26.37%) with moderate and 63 (15.67%) with severe depressive symptoms. Higher dose of ATS use, history of ATS relapse were associated with moderate and severe depressive symptoms, the adjusted odds ratios (OR) was 2.62, (95% CI: 1.45-4.74) and 2.01 (95% CI: 1.18-3.42) respectively. The cessation of 12 months or more had less risk of depressive symptoms than the current users, the OR was 0.46 (95% CI: 0.24-0.91), and the ATS users reporting nicotine dependence and alcohol drinking had significantly more risk of depressive symptoms for 3.11 (1.83-5.28) and 2.22 (1.35-3.65) times than those without these behaviors. Conclusions: Depressive symptoms co-occurred frequently among ATS users in China. The efforts that facilitate drug users' attempts to stop using ATS use and relapse, quit cigarette smoking and stop alcohol drinking during the ATS treatment and management process should be supported as they may contribute to improving the mental health among this population. © 2013 Bao et al.",1,"[0.00927067082375288, 0.9907292723655701]",0

554,"Tolerance to the locomotor-activating effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) predicts escalation of MDMA self-administration and cue-induced reinstatement of MDMA seeking in rats.^
Pre-clinical studies of individual differences in addiction vulnerability have been increasing over recent years, but the amphetamine derivative 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy) has received relatively little attention in this regard. Previously, we reported large individual differences both in rats' initial behavioral response to experimenter-administered MDMA and their degree of behavioral sensitization to repeated administration. To determine whether these differences could predict subsequent patterns of MDMA-taking or -seeking behaviors we used the self-administration-extinction-reinstatement model to examine addiction-like behavior (i.e., escalation of MDMA self-administration and cue-induced reinstatement of MDMA seeking) in rats a priori characterized for either locomotor sensitization or tolerance to MDMA. Rats that developed tolerance to the locomotor-activating effects of MDMA had a significantly larger locomotor response to the first MDMA injection relative to rats that developed sensitization. Importantly, rats that developed tolerance subsequently displayed an escalation of MDMA self-administration over days, as well as clear cue-induced reinstatement of MDMA seeking following extinction. Conversely, rats that developed locomotor sensitization to MDMA subsequently maintained relatively stable levels of MDMA self-administration over days and showed no cue-induced reinstatement of MDMA seeking. These results show that differences in the level of psychomotor activation following acute and repeated MDMA administration can reliably predict two important addiction-like behaviors in rats, which may have implications in the prediction of compulsive MDMA use in humans.

BACKGROUND: Elderly patients with major depression have a poorer prognosis, are less responsive to treatment, and show greater functional decline compared with younger patients, highlighting the need for effective treatment. METHODS: This phase 3 double-blind study randomized patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) ≥65 years (1:1) to flexibly dosed esketamine nasal spray and new oral antidepressant (esketamine/antidepressant) or new oral antidepressant and placebo nasal spray (antidepressant/placebo). The primary endpoint was change in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) from baseline to day 28. Analyses included a preplanned analysis by age (65-74 versus ≥75 years) and post-hoc analyses including age at depression onset. RESULTS: For the primary endpoint, the median-unbiased estimate of the treatment difference (95% CI) was -3.6 (-7.20, 0.07); weighted combination test using MMRM analyses z = 1.89, two-sided p = 0.059.

The need to identify effective therapies for the treatment of psychiatric disorders is a particularly important issue in modern societies. In addition, difficulties in finding new drugs have led pharmacologists to review and re-evaluate some past molecules, including psychedelics. For several years there has been growing interest among psychotherapists in psilocybin or lysergic acid diethylamide for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder, of depression, or of post-traumatic stress disorder, although results are not always clear and definitive. In fact, the mechanisms of action of psychedelics are not yet fully understood and some molecular aspects have yet to be well defined. Thus, this review aims to summarize the ethnobotanical uses of the best-known psychedelic plants and the pharmacological mechanisms of the main active ingredients they contain.

3479,"Prospective memory, everyday cognitive failure and central executive function in recreational users of Ecstasy.^
Chronic use of MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine), or Ecstasy, is believed to lead to impaired psychological performance, including well-documented decrements in laboratory and field tests of retrospective memory. Less is known about the impact of Ecstasy on aspects of 'everyday' memory, despite obvious concerns about such effects. The three studies reported here focused on the impact of chronic Ecstasy use on prospective memory (PM), associated central executive function and other aspects of day-to-day cognition. In study 1 46 regular Ecstasy users were compared with 46 Ecstasy-free controls using the Prospective Memory Questionnaire (PMQ). Ecstasy users reported significantly more errors in PM (remembering to do something in the future); these findings persisted after controlling for other drug use and the number of strategies used to aid memory. No difference was found between representative subgroups on the Lies Scale of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire. In study 2 a different group of 30 regular Ecstasy users and 37 Ecstasy-free controls was assessed on the PMQ and on a central executive task comprising verbal fluency measures. The results confirmed the significant impairments in long- and short-term PM and revealed corresponding impairments in verbal fluency. In study 3 15 Ecstasy users, 15 cannabis users and 15 non-drug users were assessed using the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire, which requires participants to provide ratings of the frequency of various day-to-day cognitive slips. The results indicate that the Ecstasy users did not perceive their general cognitive performance to be worse than that of controls. Taken together, these results suggest that Ecstasy users have impaired PM that cannot be explained by an increased propensity to exaggerate cognitive failures. These may be attributable, in part, to central executive deficits that are due to frontal lobe damage associated with Ecstasy use.

5248,"A co-twin-control analysis of adolescent and young adult drinking effects on learning and memory.^
BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Existing evidence for a link between alcohol use and memory impairments in adolescents and young adults is largely correlational. We aimed to determine whether associations between drinking and episodic memory were consistent with a causal effect of drinking or accounted for by familial factors confounding such associations. Because cannabis use is associated with a similar pattern of performance on episodic memory measures, we assessed whether any associations might be attributable to concurrent cannabis use. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Observational study of individuals aged approximately 20-29 years, comprising two independent population-based cohorts of twins. A co-twin-control design permitted an estimate of alcohol exposure effects free of shared genetic and environmental confounding influences. Significant associations were followed-up with twin-difference analyses. Propensity scores derived from measures collected at age 11 were used to adjust for unshared confounders. Participants in both cohorts were assessed from the age of 11 (n = 1251) under the auspices of the Minnesota Center for Twin and Family Research. MEASUREMENTS: Regression analyses with cumulative alcohol use as the predictor of interest. Multiple measures of attention, learning and memory from a widely used episodic memory task constituted dependent variables. FINDINGS: Drinking was associated with poorer attention (P ≤ 0.003) and learning (P ≤ 0.008). Results were similar across the two cohorts. The within-pair effect in twin-difference analyses was significant only for measures of learning (P-values ≤ 0.004). Results were not due to measured unshared confounders or cannabis use. Drinking in adolescence (to age 20) and early adulthood (between 20 and 29) exerted independent effects on learning. CONCLUSIONS: There appears to be a robust and specific association between drinking and learning that can be reproduced across cohorts, is not easily accounted for by confounding factors or concurrent cannabis use and is consistent with a causal influence of drinking.",0,"[0.9847213625907898, 0.015278652310371399]",0
7786,"""Ecstasy""-induced changes of cerebral glucose metabolism and their correlation to acute psychopathology. An 18-FDG PET study.^
The aim of this study was to determine the acute effects of the ""Ecstasy"" analogue MDE (3,4-methylene dioxyethamphetamine) on cerebral glucose metabolism (rMRGlu) of healthy volunteers and to correlate neurometabolism with acute psychopathology. In a randomized double-blind trial, 15 healthy volunteers without a history of drug abuse were examined with fluorine-18-deoxyglucose (18FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) 110-120 min after oral administration of 2 mg/kg MDE (n = 7) or placebo (n = 8). Two minutes prior to radiotracer injection, constant cognitive stimulation was started and maintained for 32 min using a word repetition paradigm to ensure constant and comparable mental conditions during cerebral glucose uptake. Individual brain anatomy was represented using Tl-weighted 3D flash magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), followed by manual regionalization into 108 regions of interest and PET/MRI overlay. After absolute quantification of rMRGlu and normalization to global metabolism, normalized rMRGlu under MDE was compared to placebo using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Acute psychopathology was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and rMRGlu was correlated to PANSS scores according to Spearman. MDE subjects showed significantly decreased rMRGlu in the bilateral frontal cortex: left frontal posterior (-7.1%, P < 0.05) and right prefrontal superior (-4.6%, P < 0.05). On the other hand, rMRGlu was significantly increased in the bilateral cerebellum (right: +10.1%, P < 0.05; left: +7.6%, P < 0.05) and in the right putamen (+6.2%, P < 0.05). There were positive correlations between rMRGlu in the middle right cingulate and grandiosity (r = 0.87, P < 0.05), both the right amygdala (r = 0.90, P < 0.01) and the left posterior cingulate (r = 0.90, P < 0.01) to difficulties in abstract thinking, and the right frontal inferior (r = 0.85, P < 0.05), right anterior cingulate (r = 0.93, P < 0.01), and left anterior cingulate (r = 0.85, P < 0.05) to attentional deficits. A negative correlation was found between the left frontal operculum (Broca's area) and attentional deficits (r = -0.85, P < 0.05). The present study revealed acute neurometabolic changes under the ""Ecstasy"" analogue MDE, indicating a frontostriatocerebellar imbalance paralleling other psychotropic substances or various psychiatric disorders.",1,"[0.00351118971593678, 0.9964888095855713]",1
4781,"Perceived outcomes of psychedelic microdosing as self-managed therapies for mental and substance use disorders.^
RATIONALE: The regular consumption of very small doses of psychedelic drugs (known as microdosing) has been a source of growing media and community attention in recent years. However, there is currently limited clinical and social research evidence on the potential role of microdosing as therapies for mental and substance use disorders. OBJECTIVES: This paper examined subjective experiences of microdosing psychedelics to improve mental health or to cease or reduce substance use, and examined sociodemographic and other covariates of perceived improvements in mental health that individuals attributed to microdosing. METHODS: An international online survey was conducted in 2018 and examined people's experiences of using psychedelics for self-reported therapeutic or enhancement purposes. This paper focuses on 1102 respondents who reported current or past experience of psychedelic microdosing. RESULTS: Twenty-one percent of respondents reported primarily microdosing as a therapy for depression, 7% for anxiety, 9% for other mental disorders and 2% for substance use cessation or reduction. Forty-four percent of respondents perceived that their mental health was ""much better"" as a consequence of microdosing. In a multivariate analysis, perceived improvements in mental health from microdosing were associated with a range of variables including gender, education, microdosing duration and motivations, and recent use of larger psychedelic doses. CONCLUSIONS: Given the promising findings of clinical trials of standard psychedelic doses as mental health therapies, clinical microdosing research is needed to determine its potential role in psychiatric treatment, and ongoing social research to better understand the use of microdosing as self-managed mental health and substance use therapies.",1,"[0.005343317054212093, 0.9946566820144653]",1
9179,"Cognitive Behavior Therapy May Sustain Antidepressant Effects of Intravenous Ketamine in Treatment-Resistant Depression.^
INTRODUCTION: Ketamine has shown rapid though short-lived antidepressant effects. The possibility of concerning neurobiological changes following repeated exposure to the drug motivates the development of strategies that obviate or minimize the need for longer-term treatment with ketamine. In this open-label trial, we investigated whether cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can sustain or extend ketamine's antidepressant effects. METHODS: Patients who were pursuing ketamine infusion therapy for treatment-resistant depression were invited to participate in the study. If enrolled, the subjects initiated a 12-session, 10-week course of CBT concurrently with a short 4-treatment, 2-week course of intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg infused over 40 min) provided under a standardized clinical protocol. RESULTS: Sixteen participants initiated the protocol, with 8 (50%) attaining a response to the ketamine and 7 (43.8%) achieving remission during the first 2 weeks of protocol. Among ketamine responders, the relapse rate at the end of the CBT course (8 weeks following the last ketamine exposure) was 25% (2/8). On longer-term follow-up, 5 of 8 subjects eventually relapsed, the median time to relapse being 12 weeks following ketamine exposure. Among ketamine remitters, 3 of 7 retained remission until at least 4 weeks following the last ketamine exposure, with 2 retaining remission through 8 weeks following ketamine exposure. Ketamine nonresponders did not appear to benefit from CBT. CONCLUSIONS: CBT may sustain the antidepressant effects of ketamine in treatment-resistant depression. Well-powered randomized controlled trials are warranted to further investigate this treatment combination as a way to sustain ketamine's antidepressant effects.",1,"[0.0024052236694842577, 0.9975947737693787]",1
3183,"Psilocybin-induced decrease in amygdalaputamen coupling during an event-related face discrimination task.^
Background: Psilocybin is a modulator of amygdala activity presumably via its 5HT1A/2A agonistic properties. We have recently shown that reduced amygdala activity during threat processing might underlie psilocybin's effect on emotional processing in a block‐design paradigm [1]. In this study, we investigated psilocybin's effects in an event‐related face discrimination task in n = 18 healthy volunteers who received psilocybin and placebo in a crossover design. Face discrimination of emotional faces relies on both prefrontal as well as subcortical structures, namely the amygdala. We hypothesized that the amygdala activity alone or as part of a network is altered during psilocybin application. This could manifest in altered salience of emotional face‐processing in task activity or in task‐related connectivity of the amygdala. Methods: Using a randomized, double‐blind, placebocontrolled, cross‐over design, subjects received either placebo or 0.16 mg/kg oral psilocybin in two separate imaging sessions at least 14 days apart (as reported in [1]). We used functional magnetic resonance imaging, beta‐series connectivity and graphtheory network analysis to characterize effective connectivity during categorization of angry, fearful or happy affective faces in contrast to affective neutral faces in the brain. As the amygdala is a key target for psilocybin's effect during emotion processing, we used the left and right amygdala as α‐priori region‐of‐interest seed masks for the connectivity analysis. Results: Psilocybin (in contrast to placebo) increased reaction time for all three categories of affective stimuli in comparison to neutral stimuli. The rate of correctly recognized hits did not differ between face categories and between placebo and psilocybin. The face discrimination task demonstrated in the placebo condition a robust signal of visual cortex, fusiform cortex, limbic system namely the amygdala, prefrontal and motor cortices. During the face categorization task, there was a tendency for a stronger striatal activation during the angry face condition under psilocybin, but no difference for fearful or happy faces. During psilocybin, a beta‐series connectivity analysis of the left‐amygdala seed ROI showed a decrease in the connectivity with the striatum (mainly left putamen, cluster‐corrected pFDR<0.03). This was not found during the happy or fearful face condition. On a behavioural level, the rate of correct classified angry faces correlated with the coupling between amygdala and putamen. The coupling correlated negatively with the sum score of altered states (TAS: r = 0.57, p = 0.015) and with anxiety (r = 0.51, p = 0.03) during psilocybin intake. Conclusion: In summary, psilocybin alters subcortical limbic networks during processing of angry faces in comparison to neutral faces. During psilocybin, the coupling between amygdala and putamen is decreased. This points to a change in salienceevaluation of angry faces, which is partly supported by the behavioral effect. The stronger coupling between amygdala and putamen during angry face discrimination, the lower the anxiety rating during psilocybin. Therefore, our results support further that psilocybin not only alters amygdala activity but exerts downward effects in the striatum.",1,"[0.0025311957579106092, 0.9974688291549683]",1
1537,"Intramuscular ketamine vs. escitalopram and aripiprazole in acute and maintenance treatment of patients with treatment-resistant depression: a randomized double-blind clinical trial.^
Objective: Ketamine, an N‐methyl D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, can promote rapid action in the management of individuals with treatment‐resistant depression (TRD) at sub‐anesthetic doses. However, few studies have investigated the long‐term use of ketamine administered intravenously (IV) and intranasally (IN). We report the design and rationale of a therapeutic trial for assessing the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of repeated‐dose intramuscular (IM) ketamine vs. active treatment (escitalopram and aripiprazole) in TRD patients. Methods: A comparative, parallel‐group, randomized double‐blind trial assessing the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of acute (4 weeks) and maintenance (24 weeks) use of IM ketamine (0.75 mg/kg) vs. active control (escitalopram 15 mg and aripiprazole 5 mg) in individuals with moderate‐severe intensity TRD (no psychotic symptoms) with or without suicide risk will be conducted. Patients with TRD (18–40 years) will be randomized and blinded to receive ketamine IM or active treatment at a 1:1 ratio for 4 weeks (active treatment) and 24 weeks (maintenance treatment). Subjects will be assessed using clinical scales, monitored for vital signs (VS) after application of injectable medication, and undergo neuropsychological tests. The primary outcome will be changed on the Montgomery‐Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) during the course of the trial. The study is in running. Results: This study can potentially yield evidence on the use of IM ketamine in the treatment of depressive disorders as an ultra‐rapid low‐cost therapy associated with less patient discomfort and reduced use of medical resources, and can elucidate long‐term effects on different outcomes, such as neuropsychological aspects. Conclusions: The trial can help promote the introduction of a novel accessible approach for the treatment of complex disease (TRD) and also allow refinement of its long‐term use.

1912,"Effects of Ketamine on Resting-State EEG Activity and Their Relationship to Perceptual/Dissociative Symptoms in Healthy Humans.^
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists administered to healthy humans results in schizophrenia-like symptoms, which preclinical research suggests are due to glutamatergically altered brain oscillations. Here, we examined resting-state electroencephalographic activity in 21 healthy volunteers assessed in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study involving administration of either a saline infusion or a sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist. Frequency-specific current source density (CSD) was assessed at sensor-level and source-level using eLORETA within regions of interest of a triple network model of schizophrenia (this model posits a dysfunctional switching between large-scale Default Mode and Central Executive networks by the monitor-controlling Salience Network). These CSDs were measured in each session along with subjective symptoms as indexed with the Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale. Ketamine-induced CSD reductions in slow (delta/theta and alpha) and increases in fast (gamma) frequencies at scalp electrode sites were paralleled by frequency-specific CSD changes in the Default Mode, Central Executive, and Salience networks. Subjective symptoms scores were increased with ketamine and ratings of depersonalization in particular were associated with alpha CSD reductions in general and in specific regions of interest in each of the three networks. These results tentatively support the hypothesis that pathological brain oscillations associated with hypofunctional NMDA receptor activity may contribute to the emergence of the perceptual/dissociate symptoms of schizophrenia.",1,"[0.002494877204298973, 0.9975051283836365]",1

Objective Substance use has such effects on pupil diameter. Although there is knowledge about the acute effects of substances on pupils, studies showing their chronic effects are limited. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of long-term substance use on sco-topic, mesopic, and photopic vision. Methods The present study with cross-sectional desgn was conducted at the Adiyaman Training and Research Hospital for Psychiatry in Adiyaman. This study involved 110 substance use disorder (SUD) patients and 46 healthy volunteers as the control. The parameters were measured and recorded automatically by a device. Results The mean age was 23.44±5.53 years in the SUD group and 24.26±5.38 years in healthy controls (p=0.420). The mean age of onset of the substance was 17.74±3.89 years and the mean duration of substance use was 3.54±2.9 years. It was determined that the patients had not used any substance for a mean of 121.73±117.49 days. There was no significant difference between patient and control groups in terms of scotopic and mesopic measurements of both eyes (p>0.05). Photopic measurements were significantly higher in the patient group than in the control group (p<0.05). Photopic measurements were significantly higher in the opioid, cannabis, ecstasy, and multiple substance use groups than in the control group (p<0.05). Conclusion The most important topic of this study is that photopic vision is permanently impaired in patients with a history of chronic substance use.

We will then cover modern-day clinical trials of psychedelic therapies in addiction from first-in-human to phase II clinical trials. Finally, we will provide an overview of the different translational human neuropsychopharmacology techniques, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), that can be applied to foster a mechanistic understanding of therapeutic mechanisms.

5218,"New Paradigms of Old Psychedelics in Schizophrenia.^
Psychedelics such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin (magic mushrooms), and mescaline exhibit intense effects on the human brain and behaviour. In recent years, there has been a surge in studies investigating these drugs because clinical studies have shown that these once banned drugs are well tolerated and efficacious in medically supervised low doses called microdosing. Psychedelics have demonstrated efficacy in treating neuropsychiatric maladies such as difficult to treat anxiety, depression, mood disorders, obsessive compulsive disorders, suicidal ideation, posttraumatic stress disorder, and also in treating substance use disorders. The primary mode of action of psychedelics is activation of serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptors affecting cognition and brain connectivity through the modulation of several downstream signalling pathways via complex molecular mechanisms. Some atypical antipsychotic drugs (APDs) primarily exhibit pharmacological actions through 5-HT(2A) receptors, which are also the target of psychedelic drugs. Psychedelic drugs including the newer second generation along with the glutamatergic APDs are thought to mediate pharmacological actions through a common pathway, i.e., a complex serotonin-glutamate receptor interaction in cortical neurons of pyramidal origin. Furthermore, psychedelic drugs have been reported to act via a complex interplay between 5HT(2A), mGlu2/3, and NMDA receptors to mediate neurobehavioral and pharmacological actions. Findings from recent studies have suggested that serotoninergic and glutamatergic neurotransmissions are very closely connected in producing pharmacological responses to psychedelics and antipsychotic medication. Emerging hypotheses suggest that psychedelics work through brain resetting mechanisms. Hence, there is a need to dig deeply into psychedelic neurobiology to uncover how psychedelics could best be used as scientific tools to benefit psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia.",0,"[0.9896547794342041, 0.010345157235860825]",0
352,"Ketamine augmentation of electroconvulsive therapy to improve neuropsychological and clinical outcomes in depression (Ketamine-ECT): a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, parallel-group, superiority trial.^
BACKGROUND: The use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is limited by concerns about its cognitive adverse effects. Preliminary evidence suggests that administering the glutamate antagonist ketamine with ECT might alleviate cognitive adverse effects and accelerate symptomatic improvement; we tested this in a randomised trial of low-dose ketamine. METHODS: In this multicentre, randomised, parallel-group study in 11 ECT suites serving inpatient and outpatient care settings in seven National Health Service trusts in the North of England, we recruited severely depressed patients, who were diagnosed as having unipolar or bipolar depressive episodes defined as moderate or severe by DSM-IV criteria, aged at least 18 years, and were able and willing to provide written consent to participate in the study. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to ketamine (0·5 mg/kg intravenous bolus) or saline adjunctive to the anaesthetic for the duration of their ECT course. Patients and assessment and ECT treatment teams were masked to treatment allocation, although anaesthetists administering the study medication were not. We analysed the primary outcome, Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised delayed verbal recall (HVLT-R-DR) after four ECT treatments, using a Gaussian repeated measures model in all patients receiving the first ECT treatment. In the same population, safety was assessed by adverse effect monitoring. This trial was registered with International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number, number ISRCTN14689382. FINDINGS: Between early December, 2012, and mid-June, 2015, 628 patients were screened for eligibility, of whom 79 were randomly assigned to treatment (40 in the ketamine group vs 39 in the saline group). Ketamine (mean 5·17, SD 2·92), when compared with saline (5·54, 3·42), had no benefit on the primary outcome (HVLT-R-DR; difference in means -0·43 [95% CI -1·73 to 0·87]). 15 (45%) of 33 ketamine-treated patients compared with 10 (27%) of 37 patients receiving saline experienced at least one adverse event which included two (6%) of 33 patients who had ketamine-attributable transient psychological effects. Psychiatric adverse events were the most common in both groups (six [27%] of 22 adverse events in the ketamine group vs seven [54%] of 13 in the saline group). INTERPRETATION: No evidence of benefit for ketamine was found although the sample size used was small; however, the results excluded greater than a small to moderate benefit with 95% confidence.

3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) produces changes in feelings and thoughts. It appears to have a unique pharmacological profile distinct from psychostimulants and classical hallucinogenic (psychedelic) compounds. Its unique properties have led to interest in using it in combination with psychotherapy. So far, studies in healthy volunteers have examined the effects of MDMA in a laboratory setting rather than a psychotherapeutic setting. This study is a Phase 1 study for up to a hundred people, The information gathered during this study may help us better understand the psychological effects produced by MDMA and how those effects can more effectively be used within a therapeutic context, as with people with PTSD. Participants will be healthy volunteers who have completed a program training them in conducting MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy. In this randomized, double blind study, subjects will receive placebo and MDMA during two sessions scheduled at least two days apart in a psychotherapy setting. Mood, self‐reported interpersonal closeness, psychological symptoms, blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature will be measured, and personality will be measured prior to the first therapy‐like session and two months after the second session. The study will follow a cross‐over design, meaning that all participants will receive both MDMA and placebo, with order of session randomly assigned. Study participants will have a preparatory session prior to each experimental session and an integrative session after each session. The researchers will contact them via telephone one and two months after the second experimental session. By comparing changes in mood, feelings of emotional closeness to the self and others and psychological symptoms after placebo and after MDMA, the investigators hope to learn something about the effects of MDMA on mood, subjective experience and the way we think and feel about others.",1,"[0.002586500486359, 0.9974135756492615]",1
3936,"Ketamine for the treatment of addiction: Evidence and potential mechanisms.^
Ketamine is a dissociative anaesthetic drug which acts on the central nervous system chiefly through antagonism of the n-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Recently, ketamine has attracted attention as a rapid-acting anti-depressant but other studies have also reported its efficacy in reducing problematic alcohol and drug use. This review explores the preclinical and clinical research into ketamine's ability to treat addiction. Despite methodological limitations and the relative infancy of the field, results thus far are promising. Ketamine has been shown to effectively prolong abstinence from alcohol and heroin in detoxified alcoholics and heroin dependent individuals, respectively. Moreover, ketamine reduced craving for and self-administration of cocaine in non-treatment seeking cocaine users. However, further randomised controlled trials are urgently needed to confirm ketamine's efficacy. Possible mechanisms by which ketamine may work within addiction include: enhancement of neuroplasticity and neurogenesis, disruption of relevant functional neural networks, treating depressive symptoms, blocking reconsolidation of drug-related memories, provoking mystical experiences and enhancing psychological therapy efficacy. Identifying the mechanisms by which ketamine exerts its therapeutic effects in addiction, from the many possible candidates, is crucial for advancing this treatment and may have broader implications understanding other psychedelic therapies. In conclusion, ketamine shows great promise as a treatment for various addictions, but well-controlled research is urgently needed.

3613,"Risk intentions following pill test scenarios are predicted by MDMA use history and sensation seeking: A quantitative field study at an Australian music festival.^
INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Most Australian Governments have resisted supporting formal pill testing (drug checking) at music festivals. With limited knowledge available regarding post-pill test substance use behaviour, we aimed to understand risk behaviour within three pill test scenarios by determining the individual factors which predict subsequent risky or risk reduction intentions. DESIGN AND METHODS: Music festival attendees (N = 276) were presented with three hypothetical pill test scenarios and reported their risk intentions, MDMA use history and sensation seeking. The pill test scenarios described an inconclusive test (unknown substance), the detection of a high MDMA dose, or a harmful adulterant (PMA or PMMA). RESULTS: Findings revealed that access to pill test results would facilitate reduced risk behaviour rather than maintained or increased risk behaviour for people who have never used MDMA. However, people who have used MDMA were not necessarily more likely to engage in risk reduction following a pill test. Furthermore, and using predictive analyses, harm-reducing behaviours are less likely when a person has a history of MDMA use and for those high in sensation seeking, particularly if a test result indicates a high MDMA dose. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Pill testing alone may not prevent adverse outcomes in some festival attendees. While some individuals are more likely to reduce their risk than maintain or increase their risk, other features of a pill test scenario (e.g. referral to support services, drug education) are likely to be important facilitators of harm reduction intentions.",1,"[0.007816421799361706, 0.9921836256980896]",1
9053,"Modulation of the cortical processing of novel and target stimuli by drugs affecting glutamate and GABA neurotransmission.^
In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we examined the effects of subanaesthetic doses of ketamine (an NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist) and thiopental (a GABA-A receptor agonist) on the event-related potential (ERP) correlates of deviant stimulus processing in 24 healthy adults. Participants completed three separate pharmacological challenge sessions (ketamine, thiopental, saline) in a counterbalanced order. EEG data were recorded both before and during each challenge while participants performed a visual 'oddball' task consisting of infrequent 'target' and 'novel' stimuli intermixed with frequent 'standard' stimuli. We examined drug effects on the amplitude and latency of the P300 (P3) component of the ERP elicited by target (P3b) and novel stimuli (P3a), as well as the N200 (N2) component elicited by both target and novel stimuli, and the N100 (N1) elicited by standard stimuli. Relative to placebo, both drugs reduced the amplitude of parietal P3b. While both drugs reduced parietal P3a and Novelty N2, ketamine also shortened P3a latency, reduced Novelty N2 amplitude more than thiopental, and increased frontal P3a amplitude relative to placebo. Overall, the data suggest that both the GABA-A and NMDA receptor systems modulate P3b and P3a. NMDA antagonism appears to lead to more varied effects on the neural correlates of novelty processing.

BACKGROUND: Ketamine has been associated with a unique spectrum of subjective ""psychedelic"" effects in patients emerging from anesthesia. This study quantified these effects of ketamine and related them to steady-state plasma concentrations. METHODS: Ketamine or saline was administered in a single-blinded crossover protocol to 10 psychiatrically healthy volunteers using computer-assisted continuous infusion. A stepwise series of target plasma concentrations, 0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 ng/ml were maintained for 30 min each. After 20 min at each step, the volunteers completed a visual analog (VAS) rating of 13 symptom scales. Peripheral venous plasma ketamine concentrations were determined after 28 min at each step. One hour after discontinuation of the infusion, a psychological inventory, the hallucinogen rating scale, was completed. RESULTS: The relation of mean ketamine plasma concentrations to the target concentrations was highly linear, with a correlation coefficient of R = 0.997 (P = 0.0027). Ketamine produced dose-related psychedelic effects. The relation between steady-state ketamine plasma concentration and VAS scores was highly linear for all VAS items, with linear regression coefficients ranging from R = 0.93 to 0.99 (P < 0.024 to P < 0.0005). Hallucinogen rating scale scores were similar to those found in a previous study with psychedelic doses of N,N-dimethyltryptamine, an illicit LSD-25-like drug.

9286,"Cardiovascular safety of psychedelic medicine: current status and future directions.^
Psychedelics are powerful psychoactive substances that alter perception and mood processes. Their effectiveness in the treatment of psychiatric diseases was known before their prohibition. An increasing number of recent studies, due to the indisputable resurgence of serotonergic hallucinogens, have shown their efficacy in alleviating depression, anxiety, substance abuse therapies, and existential distress treatment in patients facing life-threatening illness. Psychedelics are generally considered to be physiologically safe with low toxicity and low addictive potential. However, their agonism at serotonergic receptors should be considered in the context of possible serotonin-related cardiotoxicity (5-HT2A/2B and 5-HT4 receptors), influence on platelet aggregation (5-HT2A receptor), and their proarrhythmic potential. The use of psychedelics has also been associated with significant sympathomimetic effects in both experimental and clinical studies. Therefore, the present review aims to provide a critical discussion of the cardiovascular safety of psilocybin, d-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), N,N-dimethyltryptamine, ayahuasca, and mescaline, based on the results of experimental research and clinical trials in humans. Experimental studies provide inconsistent information on the potential cardiovascular effects and toxicity of psychedelics. Data from clinical trials point to the relative cardiovascular safety of psychedelic-assisted therapies in the population of ""healthy"" volunteers. However, there is insufficient evidence from therapies carried out with microdoses of psychedelics, and there is still a lack of data on the safety of psychedelics in the population of patients with cardiovascular disease. Therefore, the exact determination of the cardiovascular safety of psychedelic therapies (especially long-term therapies) requires further research.",0,"[0.9944193959236145, 0.005580544006079435]",0
2747,"A long term comparison of two treatment regimens for minimal brain dysfunction. Drug therapy versus combined therapy.^
An 8 mth study compared the effectiveness of drug therapy alone with that of combined drug therapy, educational group training, and parent group counseling. The control and experimental groups were each composed of 25 children with minimal brain dysfunction. Treatment effects were rated by the prescribing pediatrician, parents, and teachers. After 6 wk, a statistically significant difference in response was noted in only one measure: the prescribing physician's rating. By the end of the 8 mth, no differences in responses were seen between the 2 groups. Physician and parent ratings showed highly significant gains over the 8 mth of treatment for most of the 50 children, all of whom were receiving drugs. The apparent benefits of adjunctive therapy for children with minimal brain dysfunction may represent a transitory response to intervention.",0,"[0.9874640703201294, 0.01253598090261221]",0
2454,"Assessment of addiction severity among ritual users of ayahuasca.^
Ayahuasca is a psychoactive beverage used for magico-religious purposes in the Amazon. Recently, Brazilian syncretic churches have helped spread the ritual use of ayahuasca abroad. This trend has raised concerns that regular use of this N,N-dimethyltryptamine-containing tea may lead to the medical and psychosocial problems typically associated with drugs of abuse. Here we assess potential drug abuse-related problems in regular ayahuasca users. Addiction severity was assessed using the Addiction Severity Index (ASI), and history of alcohol and illicit drug use was recorded. In Study 1, jungle-based ayahuasca users (n= 56) were compared vs. rural controls (n= 56). In Study 2, urban-based ayahuasca users (n= 71) were compared vs. urban controls (n= 59). Follow-up studies were conducted 1 year later. In both studies, ayahuasca users showed significantly lower scores than controls on the ASI Alcohol Use, and Psychiatric Status subscales. The jungle-based ayahuasca users showed a significantly higher frequency of previous illicit drug use but this had ceased at the time of examination, except for cannabis. At follow-up, abstinence from illicit drug use was maintained in both groups except for cannabis in Study 1. However, differences on ASI scores were still significant in the jungle-based group but not in the urban group. Despite continuing ayahuasca use, a time-dependent worsening was only observed in one subscale (Family/Social relationships) in Study 2. Overall, the ritual use of ayahuasca, as assessed with the ASI in currently active users, does not appear to be associated with the deleterious psychosocial effects typically caused by other drugs of abuse. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",1,"[0.006540845148265362, 0.993459165096283]",1
7317,"Duration of Untreated Disorder and Cannabis Use: An Observational Study on a Cohort of Young Italian Patients Experiencing Psychotic Experiences and Dissociative Symptoms.^
BACKGROUND: The Duration of Untreated Psychosis (DUP) is the time between the first-episode psychosis (FEP) and the initiation of antipsychotic treatment. It is an important predictor of several disease-related outcomes in psychotic disorders. The aim of this manuscript is investigating the influence of cannabis on the DUP and its clinical correlates. METHODS: During years 2014-2019, sixty-two FEP patients with and without cannabis use disorder (CUD) were recruited from several Italian psychiatric hospitals. The subjects were then divided into two groups based on the duration of the DUP and assessed at the beginning of the antipsychotic treatment and after 3 and 6 months, using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale, and the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES-II). RESULTS: As expected, a longer DUP was associated with worse symptoms and cannabis use did not seem to affect the DUP, but both were related with more dissociative symptoms at onset and over time. DISCUSSION: According to our study, cannabis use can be a predictor of FEP and DUP, and of disease outcome. However, several factors might influence the relationship between cannabis use and DUP. Preventing cannabis use and early diagnosis of psychotic disorders might impact the disease by reducing the persistence of symptoms and limiting dissociative experiences.",0,"[0.9857749938964844, 0.014225013554096222]",0
6979,"Modulatory effect of the 5-HT1A agonist buspirone and the mixed non-hallucinogenic 5-HT1A/2A agonist ergotamine on psilocybin-induced psychedelic experience.^
The mixed serotonin (5-HT) 1A/2A/2B/2C/6/7 receptor agonist psilocybin dose-dependently induces an altered state of consciousness (ASC) that is characterized by changes in sensory perception, mood, thought, and the sense of self. The psychological effects of psilocybin are primarily mediated by 5-HT2A receptor activation. However, accumulating evidence suggests that 5-HT1A or an interaction between 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors may contribute to the overall effects of psilocybin. Therefore, we used a double-blind, counterbalanced, within-subject design to investigate the modulatory effects of the partial 5-HT1A agonist buspirone (20mg p.o.) and the non-hallucinogenic 5-HT2A/1A agonist ergotamine (3mg p.o.) on psilocybin-induced (170 µg/kg p.o.) psychological effects in two groups (n=19, n=17) of healthy human subjects. Psychological effects were assessed using the Altered State of Consciousness (5D-ASC) rating scale. Buspirone significantly reduced the 5D-ASC main scale score for Visionary Restructuralization (VR) (p<0.001), which was mostly driven by a reduction of the VR item cluster scores for elementary and complex visual hallucinations. Further, buspirone also reduced the main scale score for Oceanic Boundlessness (OB) including derealisation and depersonalisation phenomena at a trend level (p=0.062), whereas ergotamine did not show any effects on the psilocybin-induced 5D-ASC main scale scores. The present finding demonstrates that buspirone exerts inhibitory effects on psilocybin-induced effects, presumably via 5-HT1A receptor activation, an interaction between 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors, or both. The data suggest that the modulation of 5-HT1A receptor activity may be a useful target in the treatment of visual hallucinations in different psychiatric and neurological diseases.",1,"[0.002889493014663458, 0.9971104860305786]",1
