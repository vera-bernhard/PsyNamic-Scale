"777","Antidepressant effects of ketamine in depressed patients.^\nBACKGROUND: A growing body of preclinical research suggests that brain glutamate systems may be involved in the pathophysiology of major depression and the mechanism of action of antidepressants. This is the first placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial to assess the treatment effects of a single dose of an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist in patients with depression. METHODS: Seven subjects with major depression completed 2 test days that involved intravenous treatment with ketamine hydrochloride (.5 mg/kg) or saline solutions under randomized, double-blind conditions. RESULTS: Subjects with depression evidenced significant improvement in depressive symptoms within 72 hours after ketamine but not placebo infusion (i.e., mean 25-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores decreased by 14 +/- SD 10 points vs. 0 +/- 12 points, respectively during active and sham treatment). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a potential role for NMDA receptor-modulating drugs in the treatment of depression.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"2483","Semantic activation in LSD: evidence from picture naming.^\nLysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a classic psychedelic drug that alters cognition in a characteristic way. It has been suggested that psychedelics expand the breadth of cognition via actions on the central nervous system. Previous work has shown changes in semantic processing under psilocybin (a related psychedelic to LSD) that are consistent with an increased spread of semantic activation. The present study investigates this further using a picture-naming task and the psychedelic, LSD. Ten participants completed the task under placebo and LSD. Results revealed significant effects of LSD on accuracy and error correction that were consistent with an increased spread of semantic activation under LSD. These results are consistent with a generalised “entropic” effect on the mind. We suggest incorporating direct neuroimaging measures in future studies, and to employ more naturalistic measures of semantic processing that may enhance ecological validity.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"8889","Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"941","Psilocybin’s effects on cognition and creativity: A scoping review.^\nBackground: Research on psilocybin has become increasingly popular during the current psychedelic renaissance, which began in the early 1990s. Psilocybin’s effects on mental health are promising and there are ongoing efforts to investigate its clinical implementation and its effects on cognition. Aims: The purpose of this study is to report trends in publications, methods, and findings from research examining the effects of psilocybin on cognition and creativity in adults. Methods: We conducted an Open Science Framework preregistered scoping review, guided by the JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis, on literature pertaining to psilocybin’s effects on cognition and creativity. Results/outcomes: In the 42 included studies, psilocybin was primarily administered orally (83%) in a bodyweight-adjusted manner (74%) to healthy participants (90%). Of the few studies that explicitly reported safety outcomes (26%), only one reported serious adverse reactions. During the acute phase post-intake (i.e., minutes to hours), macrodoses tended to impair cognitive performance and creativity, whereas microdoses tended toward creative enhancement. The few macrodosing studies that included post-acute measures (i.e., 1–85 days) reported primarily null but some positive effects. Conclusions/interpretation: This scoping review identified a time-based variation of psilocybin macrodosing effects on cognition and creativity, in which impairment may be observed early post-intake but withdraw over time, and some positive effects may emerge afterward. These findings are limited by methodological concerns and inadequate assessment of long-term effects. We therefore recommend that future psilocybin research be conducted according to existing guidelines and include well-validated measures of cognition and creativity at multiple timepoints.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"1825","Selective augmentation of striatal functional connectivity following NMDA receptor antagonism: Implications for psychosis.^\nThe psychotomimetic effect of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist ketamine is thought to arise from a functional modulation of the brain's fronto-striato-thalamic (FST) circuits. Animal models suggest a pronounced effect on ventral 'limbic' FST systems, although recent work in patients with psychosis and high-risk individuals suggests specific alterations of dorsal 'associative' FST circuits. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the effects of a subanesthetic dose of ketamine on measures of functional connectivity as indexed by the temporal coherence of spontaneous neural activity in both dorsal and ventral FST circuits, as well as their symptom correlates. We adopted a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, repeated-measures design in which 19 healthy participants received either an intravenous saline infusion or a racemic mixture of ketamine (100 ng/ml) separated by at least I week Compared with placebo, ketamine increased functional connectivity between the dorsal caudate and both the thalamus and midbrain bilaterally. Ketamine additionally increased functional connectivity of the ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Both connectivity increases significantly correlated with the psychosis-like and dissociative symptoms under ketamine. Importantly, dorsal caudate connectivity with the ventrolateral thalamus and subthalamic nucleus showed inverse correlation with ketamine-induced symptomatology, pointing to a possible resilience role to disturbances in FST circuits. Although consistent with the role of FST in mediating psychosis, these findings contrast with previous research in clinical samples by suggesting that acute NMDAR antagonism may lead to psychosis-like experiences via a mechanism that is distinct from that implicated in frank psychotic illness.

"6449","Ketamine has distinct electrophysiological and behavioral effects in depressed and healthy subjects.^\nKetamine's mechanism of action was assessed using gamma power from magnetoencephalography (MEG) as a proxy measure for homeostatic balance in 35 unmedicated subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 25 healthy controls enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over trial of 0.5 mg/kg ketamine. MDD subjects showed significant improvements in depressive symptoms, and healthy control subjects exhibited modest but significant increases in depressive symptoms for up to 1 day after ketamine administration. Both groups showed increased resting gamma power following ketamine. In MDD subjects, gamma power was not associated with the magnitude of the antidepressant effect. However, baseline gamma power was found to moderate the relationship between post-ketamine gamma power and antidepressant response; specifically, higher post-ketamine gamma power was associated with better response in MDD subjects with lower baseline gamma, with an inverted relationship in MDD subjects with higher baseline gamma. This relationship was observed in multiple regions involved in networks hypothesized to be involved in the pathophysiology of MDD. This finding suggests biological subtypes based on the direction of homeostatic dysregulation and has important implications for inferring ketamine's mechanism of action from studies of healthy controls alone.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"8611","Cytokine- and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-Related Gene-Based Genome-Wide Association Study of Low-Dose Ketamine Infusion in Patients with Treatment-Resistant Depression.^\nBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Ketamine may work as an anti-inflammatory agent, and it increases the levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in patients with treatment-resistant depression. However, whether genes related to pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and VEGF may predict the treatment response to ketamine remains unknown.Therefore the aim of this study was to analyze whether specific genes related to inflammatory processes and VEGF were associated with treatment response to low-dose ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant depression. METHODS: Based on the genome data from our clinical trial, this study was a secondary analysis of candidate genes correlated with different timepoints of depressive symptoms. In total, 65 patients with treatment-resistant depression (n = 21 for ketamine 0.5 mg/kg, 20 for ketamine 0.2 mg/kg, and 24 for normal saline) were genotyped for 684,616 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Genes associated with 80 cytokines (i.e., interleukin [IL]-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and adiponectin) and VEGF (i.e., VEGF and VEGF receptors) were selected for the gene-based genome-wide association study on the antidepressant effect of a ketamine infusion. RESULTS: Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms, including rs2540315 and rs75746675 in IL1R1 and rs79568085 in VEGFC, were related to the rapid (within 240 min) antidepressant effect of a ketamine infusion; specific single nucleotide polymorphisms, such as Affx-20131665 in PIGF and rs8179353, rs8179353, and rs8179353 in TNFRSF8, were associated with the sustained (up to 2 weeks) antidepressant effect of low-dose (combined 0.5 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg) ketamine. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings further revealed that genes related to both anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, C-reactive protein, and adiponectin) and VEGF-FLK signaling predicted the treatment response to a ketamine infusion in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The synergic modulation of inflammatory and VEGF systems may contribute to the antidepressant effect of ketamine.

"6952","Stereochemical analysis of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine and its main metabolites in human samples including the catechol-type metabolite (3,4-dihydroxymethamphetamine).^\n3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ""ecstasy"") is a designer drug commonly misused in large segments of young populations. MDMA is usually formulated in tablets of its racemate (1:1 mixture of its enantiomers) in doses ranging from 50 to 200 mg. MDMA has an enantioselective metabolism, the (S)-enantiomer being metabolized faster than the (R)-enantiomer. Different pharmacologic properties have been attributed to each enantiomer. The carbon responsible for MDMA chirality is preserved along its metabolic disposition. An analytical method has been developed to determine MDMA enantiomers and those from its major metabolites, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 3,4-dihydroxymeth-amphetamine (HHMA), and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphet-amine (HMMA). It has been applied to the analysis of plasma and urine samples from healthy recreational users of MDMA who participated voluntarily in a clinical trial and received 100 mg (R,S)-MDMA. HCl orally. (R)/(S) ratios both in plasma (0-48 h) and urine (0-72 h) for MDMA and MDA were >1 and <1, respectively. Ratios corresponding to HHMA and HMMA, close to unity, deviate from theoretical expectations and are most likely explained by the ability of MDMA to autoinhibit its own metabolism. The short elimination half-life of (S)-MDMA (4.8 h) is consistent with the subjective effects and psychomotor performance reported in subjects exposed to MDMA, whereas the much longer half-life of the (R)-enantiomer (14.8 h) correlates with mood and cognitive effects experienced on the next days after MDMA use.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"8870","Oxytocin receptor gene variations and socio-emotional effects of MDMA: A pooled analysis of controlled studies in healthy subjects.^\nMethylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) increases oxytocin, empathy, and prosociality. Oxytocin plays a critical role in emotion processing and social behavior and has been shown to mediate the prosocial effects of MDMA in animals. Genetic variants, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) may influence the emotional and social effects of MDMA in humans. The effects of common genetic variants of the OXTR (rs53576, rs1042778, and rs2254298 SNPs) on the emotional, empathogenic, and prosocial effects of MDMA were characterized in up to 132 healthy subjects in a pooled analysis of eight double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. In a subset of 53 subjects, MDMA produced significantly greater feelings of trust in rs1042778 TT genotypes compared with G allele carriers. The rs53576 and rs225498 SNPs did not moderate the subjective effects of MDMA in up to 132 subjects. None of the SNPs moderated MDMA-induced impairments in negative facial emotion recognition or enhancements in emotional empathy in the Multifaceted Empathy Test in 69 subjects. MDMA significantly increased plasma oxytocin concentrations. MDMA and oxytocin concentrations did not differ between OXTR gene variants. The present results provide preliminary evidence that OXTR gene variations may modulate aspects of the prosocial subjective effects of MDMA in humans. However, interpretation should be cautious due to the small sample size. Additionally, OXTR SNPs did not moderate the subjective overall effect of MDMA (any drug effect) or feelings of ""closeness to others"".

"221","Effects of ketamine anesthesia on efficacy, tolerability, seizure response, and neurocognitive outcomes in electroconvulsive therapy: A comprehensive meta-analysis of double-blind randomized controlled trials.^\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) remains the most effective treatment for major depressive disorder. Ketamine is an anesthetic gaining attention for its rapid antidepressant effect. Numerous randomized controlled trials have investigated the effect of ketamine anesthesia in ECT on various clinical outcomes. Previous systematic reviews have not found benefit for overall depression response, although some have found evidence of benefit early in the ECT course. Clear quantitative conclusions have not been established regarding other outcomes, particularly while only using data from high-quality studies. We aimed to examine all data from double-blind randomized controlled trials comparing ketamine to other anesthetics via meta-analysis, to make recommendations regarding ECT practice and future research. Data were extracted for depressive symptoms, seizure duration and electrical dose, neuropsychological performance, and adverse effects. Effect sizes were calculated using Hedge's g and odds ratios. Eighteen studies (n = 915) were included in the meta-analysis. Ketamine was not found to enhance improvement of depressive symptoms, either early in ECT course or at end of study. Ketamine had a large effect on increasing seizure duration both overall (Hedge's g = 0.71, P = 0.038) and in the subgroup receiving ketamine in combination with another anesthetic (Hedge's g = 0.78, P < 0.01), and on decreasing electrical dose (Hedge's g = 1.98, P = 0.039). There was no significant effect of ketamine on any individual neuropsychological domain. Ketamine was not associated with increased adverse effects, except for hypertension in patients receiving ketamine monotherapy. Significant heterogeneity was present for many outcomes, and sensitivity analyses suggested a relation to methodological variation in most cases. This study supports the finding that ketamine does not enhance ECT's antidepressant effect, including on early improvement, but provides substantial evidence for enhancing seizure duration and reducing electrical dose. No significant benefit was found on neurocognitive outcomes, but analysis was limited by small sample sizes and high heterogeneity. Ketamine is generally safe in ECT, particularly as a coanesthetic. Our findings provide meta-analytic support to the recommendations in ECT clinical guidelines for use of coadjuvant ketamine in ECT where seizures are suboptimal. Further studies targeting neurocognitive outcomes are encouraged. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

METHODS: Individuals with comorbid DSM-5-defined PTSD and DSM-IV-defined major depressive disorder (N = 15) received 6 intravenous ketamine infusions (0.5 mg/kg) on a Monday-Wednesday-Friday schedule over a 12-day period from May 2015 to June 2016. Data from outcome measures were collected before and 24 hours after each infusion and weekly for 8 weeks following the final infusion. RESULTS: Continuous measures of symptom change were significant for both disorders and were associated with large effect sizes (mean decrease in PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 score = 33.3 points [95% CI, 23.0-43.5 points], P < .0005, sample size-adjusted Cohen d [d'] = 2.17; mean decrease in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score = 26.6 points [95% CI, 23.0-30.2 points], P < .0005, d' = 4.64). The remission rate for PTSD was 80.0%, and the response rate for TRD was 93.3%. Participants in remission from PTSD after the infusion series (n = 12) had a median time to relapse of 41 days. Similarly, participants whose depression symptoms responded to the infusion series (n = 14) had a median time to relapse of 20 days. Repeated ketamine infusions were associated with transient increases in dissociative symptoms. No participant reported worsening of PTSD symptoms over the study duration. CONCLUSIONS: This study, the first open-label study of repeated ketamine infusions in a comorbid population, found rapid and sustained improvement in PTSD and depression symptoms.

"691","Predicting therapeutic response to oral ketamine for chronic suicidal ideation: a Bayesian network for clinical decision support.^\nBACKGROUND: The glutamatergic modulator ketamine has been shown to result in rapid reductions in both suicidal ideation (SI) and depressive symptoms in clinical trials. There is a practical need for identification of pre-treatment predictors of ketamine response. Previous studies indicate links between treatment response and body mass index (BMI), depression symptoms and previous suicide attempts. Our aim was to explore the use of clinical and demographic factors to predict response to serial doses of oral ketamine for chronic suicidal ideation. METHODS: Thirty-two participants completed the Oral Ketamine Trial on Suicidality (OKTOS). Data for the current study were drawn from pre-treatment and follow-up time-points of OKTOS. Only clinical and sociodemographic variables were included in this analysis. Data were used to create a proof of concept Bayesian network (BN) model of variables predicting prolonged response to oral ketamine, as defined by the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS). RESULTS: The network of potential predictors of response was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. A combination of nine demographic and clinical variables predicted prolonged ketamine response, with strong contributions from BMI, Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), number of suicide attempts, employment status and age. We evaluated and optimised the proposed network to increase the area under the ROC curve (AUC). The performance evaluation demonstrated that the BN predicted prolonged ketamine response with 97% accuracy, and AUC = 0.87. CONCLUSIONS: At present, validated tools to facilitate risk assessment are infrequently used in psychiatric practice. Pre-treatment assessment of individuals' likelihood of response to oral ketamine for chronic suicidal ideation could be beneficial in making more informed decisions about likelihood of success for this treatment course.

"933","Resting-state Network-specific Breakdown of Functional Connectivity during Ketamine Alteration of Consciousness in Volunteers.^\nBACKGROUND: Consciousness-altering anesthetic agents disturb connectivity between brain regions composing the resting-state consciousness networks (RSNs). The default mode network (DMn), executive control network, salience network (SALn), auditory network, sensorimotor network (SMn), and visual network sustain mentation. Ketamine modifies consciousness differently from other agents, producing psychedelic dreaming and no apparent interaction with the environment. The authors used functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore ketamine-induced changes in RSNs connectivity. METHODS: Fourteen healthy volunteers received stepwise intravenous infusions of ketamine up to loss of responsiveness. Because of agitation, data from six subjects were excluded from analysis. RSNs connectivity was compared between absence of ketamine (wake state [W1]), light ketamine sedation, and ketamine-induced unresponsiveness (deep sedation [S2]). RESULTS: Increasing the depth of ketamine sedation from W1 to S2 altered DMn and SALn connectivity and suppressed the anticorrelated activity between DMn and other brain regions. During S2, DMn connectivity, particularly between the medial prefrontal cortex and the remaining network (effect size β [95% CI]: W1 = 0.20 [0.18 to 0.22]; S2 = 0.07 [0.04 to 0.09]), and DMn anticorrelated activity (e.g., right sensory cortex: W1 = -0.07 [-0.09 to -0.04]; S2 = 0.04 [0.01 to 0.06]) were broken down. SALn connectivity was nonuniformly suppressed (e.g., left parietal operculum: W1 = 0.08 [0.06 to 0.09]; S2 = 0.05 [0.02 to 0.07]). Executive control networks, auditory network, SMn, and visual network were minimally affected. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine induces specific changes in connectivity within and between RSNs. Breakdown of frontoparietal DMn connectivity and DMn anticorrelation and sensory and SMn connectivity preservation are common to ketamine and propofol-induced alterations of consciousness.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

"2497","Letter to the editor: Antidepressant and antisuicidal effects of esketamine in adolescents with major depressive disorder and suicidal ideation: A case series.^\nThe letter presents a study with the aim to assess the effectiveness of a single esketamine administration— subcutaneous (SC) or intravenous (IV)—on reducing depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation (SI) among adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD) and SI. Esketamine administration (0.5 mg/kg, IV or SC) took 40 minutes, followed by an observation time of 2 hours. Blood pressure and emergent side effects were constantly monitored by a trained psychiatrist. The Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was used to assess the severity of depressive symptoms (total score) and SI (item 10) before esketamine administration and after 24 hours. Records from 10 patients were included. Eight patients receive SC esketamine, whereas the remaining received IV. The mean age of the sample was 15.5 years. There was a significant reduction in depressive symptoms (mean total MADRS score) from baseline to 24-hour postadministration (39.1 ± 6.30 to 26.8 ± 8.40; mean difference = 12.3; t = 4.22; p = 0.002; d = 1.33). In addition, we found a significant decrease in SI (mean MADRS item 10 score) when comparing baseline and 24-hour results (5.0 ± 1.16 to 2.7 ± 1.95; mean difference = 2.3; t = 3.14; p = 0.011; d = 0.99). Most patients reported side effects only during esketamine ad ministration or following the observational period. Dissociation was the most frequently self-reported symptom (50%), followed by dizziness (40%) and drowsiness (30%). Side effects were considered mild to moderate since they were short-lived, and no patients had treatment-emergent SI or suicidal behavior. This is the first report of a rapid onset antidepressant and antisuicidal effect of esketamine in depressed adolescents. The few studies that investigated the antisuicidal effects of ketamine in this population used the racemate and were restricted to single case reports. Nonetheless, repeated ketamine infusions in adolescents with treatment-resistant depression appear to improve depressive symptoms and SI. The results suggest that a single dose of parenteral esketamine can rapidly reduce the severity of depression and SI symptoms in adolescents with MDD and SI. Regardless, larger adequately controlled studies are needed, in addition to the investigation of multiple administrations of esketamine, and its long-term safety for this age group in different aspects, such as cognitive impairment and risk of recreational use.

"2637","A multicenter study of ketamine effects on functional connectivity: Large scale network relationships, hubs and symptom mechanisms.^\nKetamine is an uncompetitive N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonist. It induces effects in healthy individuals that mimic symptoms associated with schizophrenia. We sought to root these experiences in altered brain function, specifically aberrant resting state functional connectivity (rsfMRI). In the present study, we acquired rsfMRI data under ketamine and placebo in a between-subjects design and analyzed seed-based measures of rsfMRI using large-scale networks, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and sub-nuclei of the thalamus. We found ketamine-induced alterations in rsfMRI connectivity similar to those seen in patients with schizophrenia, some changes that may be more comparable to early stages of schizophrenia, and other connectivity signatures seen in patients that ketamine did not recreate. We do not find any circuits from our regions of interest that correlates with positive symptoms of schizophrenia in our sample, although we find that DLPFC connectivity with ACC does correlate with a mood measure. These results provide support for ketamine's use as a model of certain biomarkers of schizophrenia, particularly for early or at-risk patients.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

METHOD: We administered a self-report questionnaire to 210 respondents. For various licit and illicit substances, participants reported their age of first use, number of lifetime uses, and usage in the previous 30 days. RESULTS: We found a significant rank order for the sequence of first use: 1) alcohol, 2) nicotine, 3) cannabis, 4) LSD, 5) psilocybin, 6) amphetamine, 7) cocaine, 8) MDMA, 9) gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), 10) ephedrine, 11) ketamine. Alcohol and cannabis were the most commonly used substances, both in cumulative number of lifetime uses and in usage in the preceding 30 days. MDMA and amphetamine were also notable as the next 2 most popular drugs for use in the preceding 30 days and in terms of those who had tried the drugs at least once. We identified a progressive rank order of experimentation, with early alcohol or cannabis use (or both) associated with the early use of all other drugs tried by more than 25% of the sample. We found MDMA and amphetamine use to be prevalent, as was general experimentation with all drugs studied, other than heroin. CONCLUSION: Drug consumption levels were substantial in this ""rave"" population, particularly with respect to recent use of MDMA, amphetamine, cannabis, and alcohol.

"3649","Acute Ketamine Administration Alters the Brain Responses to Executive Demands in a Verbal Working Memory Task: An fMRI Study.^\nWe have used functional MRI to determine the effects of ketamine on brain systems activated in association with a working memory task. Healthy volunteers received intravenous infusions of placebo, ketamine at 50 ng/ml plasma concentration, and ketamine at 100 ng/ml. They were scanned while carrying out a verbal working memory task in which we varied the executive requirements and the mnemonic load (three vs five presented letters). We previously showed that ketamine produces a specific behavioral impairment in the manipulation task. In the current study, we modified tasks in order to match performance across drug and placebo conditions, and used an event-related fMRI design, allowing us to remove unsuccessful trials from the analysis. Our results suggest a task-specific effect of ketamine on working memory in a brain system comprising frontal cortex, parietal cortex, and putamen. When subjects are required to manipulate presented letters into alphabetical order, as opposed to maintaining them in the order in which they were presented, ketamine is associated with significantly greater activity in this system, even under these performance-matched conditions.

"3956","Preliminary evidence of hippocampal dysfunction in adolescent MDMA (""ecstasy"") users: Possible relationship to neurotoxic effects.^\nRationale: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy) is a potent and selective serotonin neurotoxin whose use is growing among adolescents. Although cognitive deficits among adult MDMA users are well documented, little is known of the cognitive and brain functional sequelae of MDMA use during adolescence. Objective: We tested for evidence of cognitive deficits and changes in brain function in a pilot sample of adolescent MDMA users, who were compared with adolescent non-users of MDMA. Methods: Selective and divided attention and verbal working memory were examined in six adolescent MDMA users and six non- users of MDMA who were similar in age, gender, IQ, and other substance use. Brain function was assessed during performance of the working memory task using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Results: MDMA users had significantly prolonged reaction times during tests of selective and divided attention, and failed to deactivate the left hippocampus normally during high verbal working memory load. Conclusions: MDMA use in adolescence may be associated with cognitive impairments and dysfunction of inhibitory circuits within the hippocampus.

"4367","Decreased cerebral cortical serotonin transporter binding in ecstasy users: A positron emission tomography/[11C]DASB and structural brain imaging study.^\nAnimal data indicate that the recreational drug ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) can damage brain serotonin neurons. However, human neuroimaging measurements of serotonin transporter binding, a serotonin neuron marker, remain contradictory, especially regarding brain areas affected; and the possibility that structural brain differences might account for serotonin transporter binding changes has not been explored. We measured brain serotonin transporter binding using [11C] N,N-dimethyl-2-(2-amino-4- cyanophenylthio) benzylamine in 50 control subjects and in 49 chronic (mean 4 years) ecstasy users (typically one to two tablets bi-monthly) withdrawn from the drug (mean 45 days). A magnetic resonance image for positron emission tomography image co-registration and structural analyses was acquired. Hair toxicology confirmed group allocation but also indicated use of other psychoactive drugs in most users. Serotonin transporter binding in ecstasy users was significantly decreased throughout all cerebral cortices (range-19 to-46) and hippocampus (-21) and related to the extent of drug use (years, maximum dose), but was normal in basal ganglia and midbrain. Substantial overlap was observed between control and user values except for insular cortex, in which 51 of ecstasy user values fell below the lower limit of the control range. Voxel-based analyses confirmed a caudorostral gradient of cortical serotonin transporter binding loss with occipital cortex most severely affected. Magnetic resonance image measurement revealed no overall regional volume differences between groups; however, a slight left-hemispheric biased cortical thinning was detected in methamphetamine-using ecstasy users. The serotonin transporter binding loss was not related to structural changes or partial volume effect, use of other stimulant drugs, blood testosterone or oestradiol levels, major serotonin transporter gene promoter polymorphisms, gender, psychiatric status, or self-reported hyperthermia or tolerance. The ecstasy group, although 'grossly behaviourally normal', reported subnormal mood and demonstrated generally modest deficits on some tests of attention, executive function and memory, with the latter associated with serotonin transporter decrease. Our findings suggest that the 'typical'/low dose (one to two tablets/session) chronic ecstasy-polydrug user might display a highly selective mild to marked loss of serotonin transporter in cerebral cortex/hippocampus in the range of that observed in Parkinson's disease, which is not gender-specific or completely accounted for by structural brain changes, recent use of other drugs (as assessed by hair analyses) or other potential confounds that we could address. The striking sparing of serotonin transporter-rich striatum (although possibly affected in 'heavier' users) suggests that serotonergic neurons innervating cerebral cortex are more susceptible, for unknown reasons, to ecstasy than those innervating subcortical regions and that behavioural problems in some ecstasy users during abstinence might be related to serotonin transporter changes limited to cortical regions. © The Author (2010).","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"5213","Ketamine for acute suicidality in the emergency department: A systematic review.^\nINTRODUCTION: There are no emergent pharmaceutical interventions for acute suicidal ideation, a common presenting complaint in the ED. Ketamine is a NMDA agonist frequently used by ED physicians for sedation and analgesia. Prior evidence from studies conducted in inpatient psychiatry units suggests that ketamine may have a role in alleviating treatment-resistant depression as well as suicidal ideation. METHODS: PubMed, MEDLINE, and Cochrane reviews were queried for articles related to keywords ketamine, suicidality, suicidal ideation, and emergency department/room. Relevant articles were selected and reviewed by two separate authors. RESULTS: Three relevant, prospective studies were identified with a mean sample size of 25.7. Each was performed using 0.2 mg/kg ketamine for individuals receiving active treatment. Each study reported a decrease in depressive symptoms among those receiving ketamine. One study reported a significant reduction in SI when compared to placebo at 90 min that became non-significant by 230 min. No significant adverse events were reported in any study. CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests that ketamine is a promising, safe potential intervention for acute suicidality in the ED. Convincing evidence for efficacy of ketamine for acute suicidal ideation remains lacking, and this promising potential intervention should be further investigated.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"5246","Cortical structural differences following repeated ayahuasca use hold molecular signatures.^\nIntroduction: Serotonergic psychedelics such as ayahuasca are reported to promote both structural and functional neural plasticity via partial 5-HT2A agonism. However, little is known about how these molecular mechanisms may extend to repeated psychedelic administration in humans, let alone neuroanatomy. While early evidence suggests localised changes to cortical thickness in long-term ayahuasca users, it is unknown how such findings may be reflected by large-scale anatomical brain networks comprising cytoarchitecturally complex regions. Methods: Here, we examined the relationship between cortical gene expression markers of psychedelic action and brain morphometric change following repeated ayahuasca usage, using high-field 7 Tesla neuroimaging data derived from 24 members of an ayahuasca-using church (Santo Daime) and case-matched controls. Results: Using a morphometric similarity network (MSN) analysis, repeated ayahuasca use was associated with a spatially distributed cortical patterning of both structural differentiation in sensorimotor areas and de-differentiation in transmodal areas. Cortical MSN remodelling was found to be spatially correlated with dysregulation of 5-HT2A gene expression as well as a broader set of genes encoding target receptors pertinent to ayahuasca’s effects. Furthermore, these associations were similarly interrelated with altered gene expression of specific transcriptional factors and immediate early genes previously identified in preclinical assays as relevant to psychedelic-induced neuroplasticity. Conclusion: Taken together, these findings provide preliminary evidence that the molecular mechanisms of psychedelic action may scale up to a macroscale level of brain organisation in vivo. Closer attention to the role of cortical transcriptomics in structural-functional coupling may help account for the behavioural differences observed in experienced psychedelic users.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the effectiveness and safety of esketamine nasal spray in a clinical sample of patients with TRD from several Italian mental health services. METHODS: REAL-ESK study is an observational, retrospective and multicentric study comprising a total of 116 TRD patients treated with esketamine nasal spray. Anamnestic data and psychometric assessment (MADRS, HAMD-21, HAM-A) were collected from medical records at baseline (T0), one month (T1) and three month (T2) follow-ups. RESULTS: A significant reduction of depressive symptoms was found at T1 and T2 compared to T0. A dramatic increase in clinical response (64.2 %) and remission rates (40.6 %) was detected at T2 compared to T1. No unexpected safety concerns were observed, side effects rates were comparable to those reported in RCTs. No differences in efficacy have been found among patients with and without psychiatric comorbidities. LIMITATIONS: The open design of the study and the absence of a placebo or active comparator group are limitations. The study lacks an inter-rater reliability evaluation of the assessments among the different centres. Side effects evaluation did not involve any specific scale. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the safety and tolerability of esketamine in a real-world TRD sample.

"5873","Increased thalamic resting-state connectivity as a core driver of LSD-induced hallucinations.^\nOBJECTIVE: It has been proposed that the thalamocortical system is an important site of action of hallucinogenic drugs and an essential component of the neural correlates of consciousness. Hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD can be used to induce profoundly altered states of consciousness, and it is thus of interest to test the effects of these drugs on this system. METHOD: 100 μg LSD was administrated orally to 20 healthy participants prior to fMRI assessment. Whole brain thalamic functional connectivity was measured using ROI-to-ROI and ROI-to-voxel approaches. Correlation analyses were used to explore relationships between thalamic connectivity to regions involved in auditory and visual hallucinations and subjective ratings on auditory and visual drug effects. RESULTS: LSD caused significant alterations in all dimensions of the 5D-ASC scale and significantly increased thalamic functional connectivity to various cortical regions. Furthermore, LSD-induced functional connectivity measures between the thalamus and the right fusiform gyrus and insula correlated significantly with subjective auditory and visual drug effects. CONCLUSION: Hallucinogenic drug effects might be provoked by facilitations of cortical excitability via thalamocortical interactions. Our findings have implications for the understanding of the mechanism of action of hallucinogenic drugs and provide further insight into the role of the 5-HT(2A) -receptor in altered states of consciousness.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"6003","Randomized Placebo-controlled Study of MDMA-assisted Psychotherapy in People With PTSD - Israel.^\nPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) occurs after experiencing a traumatic event or events. PTSD is a public health problem that causes a great deal of suffering. This study will examine whether two six to eight‐hour long sessions of 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)‐assisted psychotherapy scheduled three to five weeks apart are safe, and whether combining a fully therapeutic dose of MDMA with psychotherapy, compared with a low (""active placebo"") dose of MDMA, will reduce PTSD symptoms, with symptoms measured four times, twice during the study, and during two follow‐up assessments six and twelve months after the second experimental session. People who received the active placebo dose of MDMA can then take part in an ""open label"" study continuation, with the participant receiving a fully active dose of MDMA on two more six to eight hour‐long psychotherapy sessions. Open‐label means that the participants and the researchers know that the participant will receive the fully active dose of MDMA. People who receive the full dose of MDMA, and anyone who received low‐dose MDMA and does not undergo the open‐label study continuation will have PTSD symptoms measured six and twelve months after the second fully active or low dose MDMA session. People who take part in the open label study continuation have their PTSD symptoms checked six and 12 months after the second open label MDMA‐assisted session. MDMA is a substance that has unique effects that make it well suited to intensive psychotherapy. MDMA may belong to a new class of drugs, called entactogens, that produce feelings of closeness to others, empathy, well being, and insightfulness. Currently, MDMA is scheduled in the US and Israel, and doctors and therapists cannot give it to people outside of research studies like this one. Anecdotal reports of therapy conducted before MDMA was made illegal suggest that MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy may benefit people with PTSD, and there is an ongoing placebo‐controlled study of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy in people with crime or war‐related PTSD occurring in the US. This study will look at MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy in 12 individuals aged 18 years or older diagnosed with PTSD that arose out of war or terrorism‐related trauma, with PTSD symptoms not improving after trying at least one treatment. Eight of 12 participants will be assigned to receive the full dose of MDMA, and four will be assigned to receive a low or ""active placebo"" dose of MDMA during each of two experimental sessions. People will be assigned to full or low‐dose MDMA ""by chance,"" as by flipping a coin. The fully active dose consists of an initial dose of 125 mg MDMA and a supplemental dose of 62.5 mg given 2 to 2.5 hours later. The active placebo dose consists of an initial dose of 25 mg MDMA and a supplemental dose of 12.5 mg. The study will last approximately four months, and will include two sixty minute long introductory psychotherapy sessions, two active placebo or fully active dose MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy sessions, a sixty to ninety minute long psychotherapy session 24 hours after each experimental session, and one to two hour‐long psychotherapy sessions occurring weekly between the first and second experimental session, and between the second experimental session and the end of the study. PTSD symptoms will be measured at the start of the study and eight weeks (two months) after the second experimental session. PTSD symptoms are assessed six and twelve months after the second experimental session in people who do not take part in the open‐label study continuation.

"6247","The Effect of LSD on Neural Synchrony, Prosocial Behavior, and Relationship Quality.^\nEvidence is growing that psychedelic substances such as psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and ayahuasca could be a potential alternative treatment option for common and difficult to treat psychiatric conditions. One proposed mechanism that psychedelics target, which is a hallmark of seemingly all psychiatric disorders, are deficits in social cognitive abilities. However, the neural underpinnings of psychedelic induced alterations in prosocial behavior are currently unknown. The investigators hypothesize psychedelics increase such prosocial behaviors by increasing neural synchrony, which is the coupling of brain‐to‐brain activity across two or more people; it has been found to underlie social connection and various forms of shared prosocial behavior. The current project will primarily assess whether LSD enhances neural synchrony between romantic partners. Second, the investigators will assess whether LSD enhances prosocial behavior between members of a dyad, thus replicating previous studies which assessed prosocial behavior within one individual at a time. The investigators will also assess the relationship between neural synchrony and outcome variables of the prosocial behaviour tasks. Lastly, it will be assessed whether LSD‐induced changes in neural synchrony and/or prosocial behaviour affect persisting relationship quality. Oxytocin and cytokine concentrations, will also be quantified to investigate whether there is a relationship between these factors and changes in prosocial behaviour. The study design will be conducted according to a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, 2‐way crossover design. Healthy participants (N=60) who are in a relationship (N=30 couples) will receive placebo and an oral dose of 50 µg of LSD. Between each condition, there will be a minimum of 14 days washout.

"7113","Pediatric premedication: a double-blind randomized trial of dexmedetomidine or ketamine alone versus a combination of dexmedetomidine and ketamine.^\nBACKGROUND: Preoperative anxiety is common in pediatric patients. When dexmedetomidine is used alone for sedation as premedication, children tend to awaken when separated from their parents, and body movements occur during invasive procedures. We tested the hypothesis that the combination of dexmedetomidine and ketamine may be a useful premedication to alleviate preoperative anxiety and improve cooperation during intravenous cannulation in pediatric patients, while producing minimal adverse events. METHODS: A total of 135 children, aged 2-5 years and American Society of Anesthesiologists status I-II, scheduled for eye surgery were randomly allocated to receive intranasal dexmedetomidine 2.5 μg/kg (group D), oral ketamine 3 mg/kg and intranasal dexmedetomidine 2 μg/kg (group DK), or oral ketamine 6 mg/kg (group K) 30 min before surgery. Sedation state was evaluated every 10 min after premedication and emotional state was assessed during separation from their parents and peripheral intravenous cannulation. Adverse events were recorded for 24 h postoperatively. The primary endpoint was the rate of successful intravenous cannulation. RESULTS: The rate of successful venous cannulation was 47% with dexmedetomidine alone, 68% with ketamine alone, and 80% with combined premedication (P = 0.006). The rate of satisfactory separation from parents was not different among groups. The incidence of adverse events was higher in group K compared with the other two groups (postoperative vomiting, P = 0.0041; respiratory-related complications during the perioperative period, P = 0.0032; and postoperative psychological/psychiatric adverse events, P = 0.0152). CONCLUSION: The combination of intranasal dexmedetomidine 2 μg/kg and oral ketamine 3 mg/kg produces satisfactory separation from parents and more successful venous cannulation, allowing children to smoothly accept induction of general anesthesia.

"7258","Case report: Maintaining altered states of consciousness over repeated ketamine infusions may be key to facilitate long-lasting antidepressant effects: some initial lessons from a personalized-dosing single-case study.^\nBackgroundThe interest in psychoactive agents for treating mental disorders has gathered a growing body of scientific interest. However, research on the relationship between altered states of consciousness (ASCs) and ketamine's antidepressant properties is still limited. Likewise, approaches to sustain early treatment success for the long-term are needed. Taking both aspects into account, the question arises whether the persistence of recurrent ASCs during the subsequent infusion sessions is crucial for the preservation of antidepressant effects during prolonged continued ketamine therapy.AimIn this case study we explored whether recurrent ASC experiences across a large number of infusions are associated with improved antidepressant effects in a single case study.MethodsA 62-year-old patient with treatment-resistant depression, who has been suffering from depressive episodes for over 20 years, was observed for 12 consecutive infusions across 16 weeks. ASCs during ketamine sessions were measured with the 5D-ASC, and pre/post-infusion depression scores with the BDI-II questionnaire. To emphasize psychoactive experiences a personalized antidepressant dose regimen was used.ResultsWe found a strong correlation between the experienced ASCs during ketamine infusions and the antidepressant effect: the stronger the ASCs overall, the stronger the resulting antidepressant effect. This correlation was consistently observed throughout the infusion series, independent of the number of ketamine sessions completed before. However, despite a personalized dose regimen, neither peri-infusion ASCs nor antidepressant effects could be established on a regular basis, leading overall to no improvement in treatment outcome.ConclusionMaintaining psychoactive effects over repeated ketamine infusions may be key to facilitate long-lasting antidepressant effects. However, for some depressed individuals maintenance of antidepressant effects and/or peri-infusion ASCs might not be achieved, even when personalized dosing is used.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

In the last decade, it has been suggested that subdissociative-dose ketamine is a fast-acting antidepressant. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of low-dose ketamine administered during caesarean section in preventing postpartum depression. METHODS: Using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, 330 parturients who were scheduled to undergo caesarean section were enrolled in this trial. The parturients were randomly assigned to receive intravenous ketamine (0.25 mg/kg diluted to 10 mL with 0.9% saline) or placebo (10 mL of 0.9% saline) within 5 min following clamping of the neonatal umbilical cord. The primary outcome was the degree of depression, which was evaluated using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) (a threshold of 9/10 was used) at 3 days and 6 weeks after delivery. The secondary outcome was the numeric rating scale score of pain at 3 day and 6 week postpartum. RESULTS: No significant differences were found in the prevalence of postpartum depression between the two groups at 3 days and 6 weeks after delivery. The pain scores measured at 3 days postoperatively were not significantly different between the groups, whereas the scores measured at 6 week postpartum were significantly reduced in the treatment group compared with the saline group (P = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: Intra-operative low-dose ketamine (0.25 mg/kg) does not have a preventive effect on postpartum depression.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"9452","A randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 1 study to evaluate the effects of TAK-063 on ketamine-induced changes in fMRI BOLD signal in healthy subjects.^\nRationale: Phosphodiesterase 10A inhibitor TAK-063 has shown effects that suggest efficacy in schizophrenia treatment. Objective: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, incomplete-crossover study investigated effects of single oral administration of TAK-063 on ketamine-induced changes in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal in healthy males. Methods: Healthy men aged 18 to 45 years with normal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and electroencephalogram measurements at screening were eligible. Each subject was randomized to one of nine treatment schedules: all subjects received placebo and two of three doses of TAK-063 followed by ketamine. The primary endpoint was ketamine-induced brain activity in select regions of the brain during resting state. Secondary endpoints included pharmacokinetic parameters of TAK-063, proportion of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), and percentage of subjects meeting criteria for abnormal safety laboratory tests and vital sign measurements. Results: The study comprised 27 subjects. Prior to ketamine infusion, TAK-063 exerted region-specific effects on resting state functional MRI (fMRI) BOLD signal. After ketamine administration, TAK-063 reduced the Cohen’s effect size for resting-state fMRI BOLD signal in key brain regions examined, and exerted similar effects on BOLD signal during the working memory task across all doses. TAK-063 was safe and well tolerated. Conclusions: Our results are consistent with non-clinical studies of ketamine and TAK-063 and clinical studies of ketamine and risperidone. It is unknown whether these data are predictive of potential antipsychotic efficacy, and further analyses are required.

"9596","Cardiovascular effects of repeated subanaesthetic ketamine infusion in depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine produces significant rapid-onset and robust antidepressant effects in patients with major depressive disorder. However, this drug also has transient cardiovascular stimulatory effects, and there are limited data about potential predictors of these cardiovascular effects. METHODS: A total of 135 patients with unipolar and bipolar depression received a total of 741 ketamine infusions (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min). Blood pressure and pulse were monitored every 10 min during the infusions and 30 min after the infusions. Depressive, psychotomimetic and dissociative symptom severity was assessed at baseline and 4 hours after each infusion. RESULTS: The maximum blood pressure and pulse values were observed at 30-40 min during infusions. The largest mean systolic/diastolic blood pressure increases were 7.4/6.0 mmHg, and the largest mean pulse increase was 1.9 beats per min. No significant change in blood pressure and pulse was found in the second to sixth infusions compared with the first infusion. Patients who were older (age⩾50 years), hypertensive and receiving infusions while exhibiting dissociative symptoms showed greater maximal changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure than patients who were younger (age<50 years), normotensive and without dissociative symptoms (all p < 0.05). Hypertensive patients had less elevation of pulse than normotensive patients (p < 0.05). Ketamine dosage was positively correlated with changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Blood pressure and pulse elevations following subanaesthetic ketamine infusions are transient and do not cause serious cardiovascular events. Older age, hypertension, large ketamine dosage and dissociative symptoms may predict increased ketamine-induced cardiovascular effects.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"9612","White matter alterations in chronic MDMA use: Evidence from diffusion tensor imaging and neurofilament light chain blood levels.^\n3,4–Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, “Ecstasy”) is a serotonin- and noradrenaline-releasing substance, currently among the most widely used illicit substances worldwide. In animal studies, repeated exposure to MDMA has been associated with dendritic but also axonal degeneration in the brain. However, translation of the axonal findings, specifically, to humans has been repeatedly questioned and the few existing studies investigating white matter alterations in human chronic MDMA users have yielded conflicting findings. In this study, we combined whole-brain diffusion tensor imaging and neurofilament light chain (NfL) analysis in blood to reveal potential MDMA-induced axonal neuropathology. To this end, we assessed 39 chronic MDMA users and 39 matched MDMA-naïve healthy controls. MDMA users showed increased fractional anisotropy in several white matter tracts, most prominently in the corpus callosum as well as corticospinal tracts, with these findings partly related to MDMA use intensity. However, the NfL levels of MDMA users were not significantly different from those of controls. We conclude that MDMA use is not associated with significant white matter lesions due to the absence of reduced fractional anisotropy and increased NfL levels commonly observed in conditions associated with white matter lesions, including stimulant and ketamine use disorders. Hence, the MDMA-induced axonal degradation demonstrated in animal models was not observed in this human study of chronic MDMA users.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"121","Comprehensive assessment of side effects associated with a single dose of ketamine in treatment-resistant depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Concerns about ketamine for treating depression include abuse potential and the occurrence of psychotomimetic effects. This study sought to comprehensively assess side effects (SEs) associated with a single subanesthetic-dose intravenous ketamine infusion. A secondary aim was to examine the relationship between Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS) scores and dissociative symptoms reported on a comprehensive, clinician-administered SE questionnaire. METHODS: Data from 188 participants were pooled from four placebo-controlled, crossover ketamine trials and one open-label study (n = 163 with either treatment-resistant major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder and 25 healthy controls). SEs were actively solicited in a standardized fashion and monitored over the time-course of each study. Statistical analyses assessed the effect of drug (ketamine, placebo) on SEs and measured the relationship between CADSS total score and SEs contemporaneously endorsed during structured interviews. RESULTS: Forty-four of 120 SEs occurred in at least 5% of participants over all trials. Thirty-three of these 44 SEs were significantly associated with active drug administration (versus placebo). The most common SE was feeling strange/weird/loopy. Most SEs peaked within an hour of ketamine administration and resolved completely by two hours post-infusion. No serious drug-related adverse events or increased ketamine craving/abuse post-administration were observed. A positive correlation was found between dissociative SEs and total CADSS score. LIMITATIONS: The post-hoc nature of the analysis; the limited generalizability of a single subanesthetic-dose ketamine infusion; and the lack of formal measures to assess ketamine's cognitive, urological, or addictive potential. CONCLUSIONS: No long-lasting significant SEs occurred over the approximately three-month follow-up period.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"218","N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor in working memory impairments in schizophrenia: event-related potential study of late stage of working memory process.^\nWorking memory (WM) deficit in schizophrenic patients has been well established. Still, underlying biological substrate of the impairment is not clear. Among neurotransmitter hypotheses of schizophrenia, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor model is mostly supported, considering that NMDA receptor antagonist can elicit both psychosis and cognitive impairment observed in schizophrenic patients. In current study, to test the neuropsychological and the electrophysiological effects of NMDA receptor in WM, event-related potentials (ERPs) of Sternberg's short-term memory scanning task (SMST) were analyzed in 10 healthy subjects under intravenous administration of a subanesthetic dose of ketamine (0.65 mg/kg/h) or placebo (normal saline). Late positive component (LPC) of ERP was hypothesized to reflect later stage of WM. Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale score was significantly increased (t=-5.75, df=9, P<.001) and correct response rate was significantly decreased (t=2.21, df=9, P=.054) after ketamine administration. Neither reaction time nor LPC latency, which reflect memory scanning time, was changed. Amplitude of LPC was significantly reduced after ketamine administration (z=-2.31, number of observations=120, P=.021). In conclusion, NMDA receptor antagonist administration elicited WM deficit both in behavioral and electrophysiological level. Electrophysiological component reflecting later stage of WM was impaired by NMDA antagonist.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]"
"394","Ketamine study: Protocol for naturalistic prospective multicenter study on subcutaneous ketamine infusion in depressed patients with active suicidal ideation.^\nBACKGROUND: Psychiatric disorders are associated with more than 90% of reported suicide attempts worldwide, but few treatments have demonstrated a direct effect in reducing suicide risk. Ketamine, originally an anesthetic, has been shown anti-suicide effects in clinical trials designed to treat depression. However, changes at the biochemical level were assessed only in protocols of ketamine with very limited sample sizes, particularly when the subcutaneous route was considered. In addition, the inflammatory changes associated with ketamine effects and their correlation with response to treatment, dose-effect, and suicide risk warrant further investigation. Therefore, we aimed to assess whether ketamine results in better control of suicidal ideation and/or behavior in patients with depressive episodes and whether ketamine affects psychopathology and inflammatory biomarkers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report here the design of a naturalistic prospective multicenter study protocol of ketamine in depressive episodes carried out at Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA) and Hospital Moinhos de Vento (HMV). The study was planned to recruit adult patients with Major depressive disorder (MDD) or Bipolar disorder (BD) types 1 or 2, who are currently in a depressive episode and show symptoms of suicidal ideation and/or behavior according to the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) and have been prescribed ketamine by their assistant psychiatrist. Patients receive ketamine subcutaneously (SC) twice a week for 1 month, but the frequency can be changed or the dose decreased according to the assistant physician's decision. After the last ketamine session, patients are followed-up via telephone once a month for up to 6 months. The data will be analyzed using repeated measures statistics to evaluate the reduction in suicide risk as a primary outcome, as per C-SSRS. DISCUSSION: We discuss the need for studies with longer follow-ups designed to measure a direct impact on suicide risk and that additional information about the safety and tolerability of ketamine in particular subset of patients such as those with depression and ideation suicide. In line, the mechanism behind the immunomodulatory effects of ketamine is still poorly understood. TRIAL REGISTRATION: https://clinicaltrials.gov/, identifier NCT05249309.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"594","Daytime Ayahuasca administration modulates REM and slow-wave sleep in healthy volunteers.^\nOBJECTIVES: Ayahuasca is a traditional South American psychoactive beverage and the central sacrament of Brazilian-based religious groups, with followers in Europe and the United States. The tea contains the psychedelic indole N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and beta-carboline alkaloids with monoamine oxidase-inhibiting properties that render DMT orally active. DMT interacts with serotonergic neurotransmission acting as a partial agonist at 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A/2C) receptor sites. Given the role played by serotonin in the regulation of the sleep/wake cycle, we investigated the effects of daytime ayahuasca consumption in sleep parameters. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Subjective sleep quality, polysomnography (PSG), and spectral analysis were assessed in a group of 22 healthy male volunteers after the administration of a placebo, an ayahuasca dose equivalent to 1 mg DMT kg(-1) body weight, and 20 mg d-amphetamine, a proaminergic drug, as a positive control. Results show that ayahuasca did not induce any subjectively perceived deterioration of sleep quality or PSG-measured disruptions of sleep initiation or maintenance, in contrast with d-amphetamine, which delayed sleep initiation, disrupted sleep maintenance, induced a predominance of 'light' vs 'deep' sleep and significantly impaired subjective sleep quality. PSG analysis also showed that similarly to d-amphetamine, ayahuasca inhibits rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, decreasing its duration, both in absolute values and as a percentage of total sleep time, and shows a trend increase in its onset latency. Spectral analysis showed that d-amphetamine and ayahuasca increased power in the high frequency range, mainly during stage 2. Remarkably, whereas slow-wave sleep (SWS) power in the first night cycle, an indicator of sleep pressure, was decreased by d-amphetamine, ayahuasca enhanced power in this frequency band. CONCLUSIONS: Results show that daytime serotonergic psychedelic drug administration leads to measurable changes in PSG and sleep power spectrum and suggest an interaction between these drugs and brain circuits modulating REM and SWS.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"640","Validation of the revised Mystical Experience Questionnaire in experimental sessions with psilocybin.^\nThe 30-item revised Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ30) was previously developed within an online survey of mystical-type experiences occasioned by psilocybin-containing mushrooms. The rated experiences occurred on average eight years before completion of the questionnaire. The current paper validates the MEQ30 using data from experimental studies with controlled doses of psilocybin. Data were pooled and analyzed from five laboratory experiments in which participants (n=184) received a moderate to high oral dose of psilocybin (at least 20 mg/70 kg). Results of confirmatory factor analysis demonstrate the reliability and internal validity of the MEQ30. Structural equation models demonstrate the external and convergent validity of the MEQ30 by showing that latent variable scores on the MEQ30 positively predict persisting change in attitudes, behavior, and well-being attributed to experiences with psilocybin while controlling for the contribution of the participant-rated intensity of drug effects. These findings support the use of the MEQ30 as an efficient measure of individual mystical experiences. A method to score a ""complete mystical experience"" that was used in previous versions of the mystical experience questionnaire is validated in the MEQ30, and a stand-alone version of the MEQ30 is provided for use in future research.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"1228","Low dose oral ketamine treatment in chronic suicidality: An open-label pilot study.^\nRecently, low-dose ketamine has been proposed as a rapid-acting treatment option for suicidality. The majority of studies to date have utilised intravenous (IV) ketamine, however, this route of administration has limitations. On the other hand, oral ketamine can be administered in a range of settings, which is important in treating suicidality, although studies as to safety and feasibility are lacking. n = 32 adults (aged 22-72 years; 53% female) with chronic suicidal thoughts participated in the Oral Ketamine Trial on Suicidality (OKTOS), an open-label trial of sub-anaesthetic doses of oral ketamine over 6 weeks. Participants commenced with 0.5 mg/kg of ketamine, which was titrated to a maximum 3.0 mg/kg. Follow-up assessments occurred at 4 weeks after the final dose. The primary outcome measure was the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS) and secondary measures included scales for suicidality and depressive symptoms, and measures of functioning and well-being. Mean BSS scores significantly reduced from a high level of suicidal ideation at the pre-ketamine (week 0) timepoint to below the clinical threshold at the post-ketamine (week 6) timepoint. The proportion of participants that achieved clinical improvement within the first 6 weeks was 69%, whereas 50% achieved a significant improvement by the follow-up (week 10) timepoint. Six weeks of oral ketamine treatment in participants with chronic suicidality led to significant reduction in suicidal ideation. The response observed in this study is consistent with IV ketamine trials, suggesting that oral administration is a feasible and tolerable alternative treatment for chronic suicidality.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"1369","At baseline patients treated with esketamine have higher burden of disease than other patients with treatment resistant depression: Learnings from a population based study.^\nINTRODUCTION: It is critical to assess who is being treated with a new marketed drug like esketamine to understand how it is used in the real-world setting and the effects of the medication. METHODS: Retrospective analysis using two large U.S. health care databases that included commercially insured and Medicaid patients. Patients treated with esketamine were identified and their baseline characteristics described and compared with the baseline characteristics of patients with treatment resistant depression (TRD) and with patients undergoing transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). To quantify the differences, standardized mean differences were calculated. RESULTS: In the commercially insured database, 418 patients were treated with esketamine and 830,047 patients were in the TRD group. Large differences in baseline characteristics were observed. Patients in the esketamine group were more likely to have severe depression, suicidal thoughts, and prior treatments with TMS or electroconvulsive therapy than the TRD control group. Patients in the esketamine group had more comorbid psychiatric conditions (anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorders, substance use disorders) and higher exposure to antipsychotics, antiepileptics, hypnotics and sedatives. In terms of general health, patients in the esketamine group had many more outpatient visits, were more likely to have chronic pain and higher Charlson comorbidity scores, a predicator of mortality. Results were similar for both the Medicaid and TMS populations. CONCLUSION: Patients treated with esketamine have a higher burden of disease than other patients with TRD. In any real-world comparative effectiveness or safety study these differences need to be understood and accounted for to produce valid results.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: A hospital in Hong Kong. PATIENTS: Female ex-ketamine abusers admitted to a local drug rehabilitation centre and age-matched controls attending a general gynaecology clinic between December 2009 and April 2010. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Evaluation of urinary symptoms based on a 3-day bladder diary, and responses to the Urogenital Distress Inventory Short Form (UDI-6) and the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire Short Form (IIQ-7). The study group had repeat measurements 3 months later. RESULTS: Overall, 90% of ex-ketamine abusers had active urinary symptoms. On average, they had increased 24-hour urinary frequency (10.0 vs 5.8; P=0.001) and lower maximum voided volume (253.3 mL vs 401.9 mL; P<0.001) compared to controls. Correspondingly, the median functional bladder capacity was smaller (195.3 mL vs 261.2 mL; P=0.011) and the mean UDI-6 and IIQ-7 scores were higher (P<0.001). Among those who abused ketamine for 2 years or more, the mean UDI-6 and IIQ-7 scores were higher (P=0.03, P=0.02 respectively). When they stopped abusing ketamine for 3 months or more, their mean 24-hour urinary frequency had decreased (P=0.03), the maximum voided volume had increased (P=0.03) and the mean UDI-6 and IIQ-7 scores had decreased (P=0.04, P=0.02 respectively), although they were still higher than in controls. After 3 more months, in the ex-ketamine abusers there had been a further decrease in 24-hour urinary frequency (P=0.01) and a further improvement in quality of life based on mean UDI-6 scores (P=0.04) but nevertheless poorer than the control group (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Female ex-ketamine abusers had significant urinary symptoms affecting their quality of life when studied at a mean of 8 (range, 0.5-48) months after cessation of use. The symptom severity was inversely correlated with the duration of cessation; though they improved with time, some still persisted.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"1513","Absence of behavioral sensitization in healthy human subjects following repeated exposure to ketamine.^\nRationale: Sensitization to the effects of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonists is robust in animals. However, the applicability of this model to humans is unclear because it currently rests on highly confounded retrospective studies of individuals who experienced protracted psychoses following repeated binges with NMDA receptor antagonists. Objectives: The purpose of the current study was to determine whether there was evidence of sensitization to the behavioral effects of ketamine in healthy human subjects with repeated exposure to this drug. Methods: Data were studied from 295 healthy human subjects who participated in one or more of 11 separate studies that involved ketamine administration over 14 years. Positive and negative symptoms (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale: BPRS), perceptual alterations (Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale: CADSS), and ""high"" and ""anxiety"" states (Visual Analog Scale: VAS) that were measured in all studies were included as outcome measures. Results: After including the number of previous exposures, number of previous studies, and time since first exposure as variables, repeated exposure to ketamine did not result in increased behavioral responses, suggestive of behavioral sensitization.

Recreational use of ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy') is widespread. The present study aimed to examine both the acute and residual effects of this drug on users' mood and cognitive function. Design and participants. A parallel group design was used to compare 12 participants who reported having taken MDMA with 12 participants who reported having consumed only alcohol, on the relevant night (day 1). These same participants were then re-assessed the following day (day 2) and again mid-week (day 5). Findings. Acute effects of MDMA broadly replicated previous findings. MDMA users rated elevated mood on day 1 but significantly low mood on day 5, at which point some participants scored within the range for clinical depression. In contrast, the alcohol group showed less pronounced changes, which followed a U-shaped curve over days with the lowest point being day 2. The MDMA group also showed significant impairments on an attentional/working memory task, compared with alcohol users. Conclusions. Weekend use of MDMA may lead to depressed mood mid-week. Possible mechanisms underlying the findings are discussed in terms of temporary depletion of serotonin, serotonergic neurotoxity and psychological aspects of mood change.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"1787","Low dose ketamine infusion for comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder and chronic pain: A randomized double-blind clinical trial.^\nObjective: To date, treatment options (i.e. psychotherapy, antidepressant medications) for patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), are relatively few, and considering their limited efficacy, novel therapies have gained interest among researchers and treatment providers alike. Among patients with chronic pain (CP) about one third experience comorbid PTSD, which further complicates their already challenging pharmacological regimens. Low dose ketamine infusion has shown promise in PTSD, and in treatment of CP, however they have not been studied in comorbid population and under rigorous control conditions. Methods: We compared the effects of a single dose of either ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or ketorolac (15 mg) over a 40-minute of IV infusion in CP patients with and without PTSD, in double blind, randomized study. Measures were collected before, during, one day and seven days after the infusion. A planned sample size of 40 patients randomly assigned to treatment order was estimated to provide 80% power to detect a hypothesized treatment difference after the infusion. Main Outcome and Measures: The primary outcome measures were change in PTSD symptom severity assessed with the Impact of Event Scale–Revised (IES-R) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain administered by a study clinician 24 hours post infusion. Secondary outcome measures included Impact of Event Scale–Revised (IES-R), VAS and Brief Pain Inventory (Short Form) for pain 1 week after the infusion. Results: Both treatments offered comparable improvement of PTSD and CP symptoms that persisted for 7 days after the infusion. Patients with comorbid PTSD and CP experienced less dissociative side effects compared to the CP group. Surprisingly, ketorolac infusion resulted in dissociative symptoms in CP patients only. Conclusions: This first prospective study comparing effects of subanesthetic ketamine versus ketorolac infusions for comorbid PTSD and CP, suggests that both ketamine and ketorolac might offer meaningful and durable response for both PTSD and CP symptoms.

Thus, modulating glutamatergic transmission may be critical to effectively treating depression, though the mechanisms by which this occurs are not fully understood. METHODS: This double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study analyzed data from 18 drug-free major depressive disorder subjects and 18 heathy controls who received a single i.v. infusion of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) as well as an i.v. saline placebo. Magnetoencephalographic recordings were collected prior to the first infusion and 6 to 9 hours after both ketamine and placebo infusions. During scanning, participants passively received tactile stimulation to the right index finger. Antidepressant response was assessed across timepoints using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. Dynamic causal modeling was used to measure changes in α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA)- and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-mediated connectivity estimates in major depressive disorder subjects and controls using a simple model of somatosensory evoked responses. RESULTS: Both major depressive disorder and healthy subjects showed ketamine-mediated NMDA-blockade sensitization, with major depressive disorder subjects showing enhanced NMDA connectivity estimates in backward connections and controls showing enhanced NMDA connectivity estimates in forward connections in our model. Within our major depressive disorder subject group, ketamine efficacy, as measured by improved mood ratings, correlated with reduced NMDA and AMPA connectivity estimates in discrete extrinsic connections within the somatosensory cortical network. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that AMPA- and NMDA-mediated glutamatergic signaling play a key role in antidepressant response to ketamine and, further, that dynamic causal modeling is a powerful tool for modeling AMPA- and NMDA-mediated connectivity in vivo.

"3095","Neuroendocrine abnormalities in recreational ecstasy (MDMA) users: is it ecstasy or cannabis?.^\nBACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate neuroendocrine function in ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine = MDMA) users and controls. METHODS: Prolactin response to d-fenfluramine was assessed in abstinent ecstasy users with concomitant use of cannabis only (n = 24, male/female 13/11) and in two control groups: healthy nonusers (n = 13, female) and exclusive cannabis users (n = 7, male). RESULTS: Prolactin response to d-fenfluramine was slightly blunted in female ecstasy users. Both male user samples exhibited a weak prolactin response to d-fenfluramine, but this was weaker in the group of cannabis users. Baseline prolactin and prolactin response to d-fenfluramine were associated with the extent of previous cannabis use. CONCLUSIONS: Endocrinological abnormalities of ecstasy users may be closely related to their coincident cannabis use. Cannabis use may be an important confound in endocrinological studies of ecstasy users and should be looked for more systematically in future studies.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

Because the primary purpose of the project was to assist the subjects in achieving their particular and varied goals for having the sessions, the data available for analysis is limited. Only phenomenological descriptions were obtained of the therapists' observations and of the subjects' experiences before, during and after the sessions. Psychological evaluations by independent observers with testing before and after sessions, placebo control group data with double-blind assessment, and laboratory examinations of organ and metabolic functions were not conducted. Providing the reports of these 29 subjects' experiences will hopefully encourage further research into the beneficial effects of MDMA.

"3182","Psilocybin modulates functional connectivity of the amygdala during emotional face discrimination.^\nRecent studies suggest that the antidepressant effects of the psychedelic 5-HT2A receptor agonist psilocybin are mediated through its modulatory properties on prefrontal and limbic brain regions including the amygdala. To further investigate the effects of psilocybin on emotion processing networks, we studied for the first-time psilocybin's acute effects on amygdala seed-to-voxel connectivity in an event-related face discrimination task in 18 healthy volunteers who received psilocybin and placebo in a double-blind balanced cross-over design. The amygdala has been implicated as a salience detector especially involved in the immediate response to emotional face content. We used beta-series amygdala seed-to-voxel connectivity during an emotional face discrimination task to elucidate the connectivity pattern of the amygdala over the entire brain. When we compared psilocybin to placebo, an increase in reaction time for all three categories of affective stimuli was found. Psilocybin decreased the connectivity between amygdala and the striatum during angry face discrimination. During happy face discrimination, the connectivity between the amygdala and the frontal pole was decreased. No effect was seen during discrimination of fearful faces. Thus, we show psilocybin's effect as a modulator of major connectivity hubs of the amygdala. Psilocybin decreases the connectivity between important nodes linked to emotion processing like the frontal pole or the striatum. Future studies are needed to clarify whether connectivity changes predict therapeutic effects in psychiatric patients.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"3189","Psilocybin treatment for anxiety in patients with advanced-stage cancer.^\nBackground: From the late 1950s to the early 1970s clinical research was conducted exploring the use of hallucinogens to treat the existential anxiety, despair and isolation often associated with advanced‐stage cancer. These reports described critically ill individuals undergoing psycho spiritual epiphanies, frequently with sustained improvement in anxiety, mood and quality of life. While these promising investigations were halted because of political and cultural pressures, after a thirty year hiatus the development of hallucinogen treatment research for patients with anxiety reactive to advanced‐stage cancer has resumed. Methods: This presentation examines the rationale, methodology and results of a pilot investigation using psilocybin to treat the existential anxiety associated with advanced‐stage cancer. Psilocybin, the active alkaloid in hallucinogenic mushrooms and a 5‐HT2A and 5‐HT2C agonist, was administered to 12 screened subjects diagnosed with advanced‐stage cancer and anxiety. A double‐blind, placebo‐controlled methodology was employed, utilizing a moderate dosage of psilocybin, 0.2 mg/kg. Treatment sessions were conducted on the Clinical Research Unit at Harbor‐UCLA Medical Center. Results: Safe physiological and psychological responses were documented during treatment sessions. There were no clinically significant adverse events with psilocybin. The State‐Trait Anxiety Inventory trait anxiety subscale demonstrated a significant reduction in anxiety at 1 and 3 months after treatment. The Beck Depression Inventory revealed an improvement of mood that reached significance at 6 months; the Profile of Mood States identified mood improvement after treatment with psilocybin that approached but did not reach significance. Conclusions: This study establishes the feasibility and safety of administering moderate doses of psilocybin to patients with advanced‐stage cancer and anxiety. Some of the data revealed a positive trend toward improved mood and anxiety. These results support the need for more research in this long‐neglected field. To that end, two new studies using psilocybin to treat cancer anxiety, at Johns Hopkins and New York University, are currently on‐going. Both of these investigations are evaluating higher doses than used in the Harbor‐UCLA study, allowing for greater exploration of the role of psycho‐spiritual or transcendent states of consciousness in facilitating therapeutic outcomes.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"

"3909","The Impact of Psilocybin on Patients Experiencing Psychiatric Symptoms: A Systematic Review of Randomized Clinical Trials.^\nOBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to evaluate the impact of psilocybin on patients experiencing psychiatric symptoms, with a focus on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and safety. METHOD OF RESEARCH: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched the PubMed database and identified studies published from January 2011 to December 2021 pertaining to the impact of psilocybin on psychiatric symptoms. Two authors independently conducted a focused analysis and reached a final consensus on five studies meeting the specific selection criteria. Study bias was addressed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS: The impact of psilocybin on psychiatric symptoms was examined in five randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Four studies administered 1 to 2 doses of psilocybin, with doses ranging from 14mg/70kg to 30mg/70kg, and one study administered a fixed dose of 25mg to all participants. Administration of psilocybin resulted in significant and sustained reduction in symptoms of anxiety and depression, enhanced sense of wellbeing, life satisfaction, and positive mood immediately after psilocybin administration and up to six months after conclusion of treatment. All studies included some form of psychotherapy, and none reported serious adverse effects. CONCLUSION: RCTs show the efficacy of psilocybin in the treatment of anxiety and depression symptoms, as well as improvement in HRQoL, and no serious side effects. However, additional research is necessary to characterize predictors of treatment response, patient screening requirements, effectiveness in broader clinical populations, and guidelines for psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

S. divinorum has over the last several years gained increased popularity as a recreational drug. This is a double-blind, placebo controlled study of salvinorin A in 4 psychologically and physically healthy hallucinogen-using adults. Across sessions, participants inhaled 16 ascending doses of salvinorin A and 4 intermixed placebo doses under comfortable and supportive conditions. Doses ranged from 0.375 μg/kg to 21 μg/kg. Subject-rated drug strength was assessed every 2 min for 60 min after inhalation. Orderly time- and dose-related effects were observed. Drug strength ratings peaked at 2 min (first time point) and definite subjective effects were no longer present at approximately 20 min after inhalation. Dose-related increases were observed on questionnaire measures of mystical-type experience (Mysticism Scale) and subjective effects associated with classic serotonergic (5-HT2(A)) hallucinogens (Hallucinogen Rating Scale). Salvinorin A did not significantly increase heart rate or blood pressure. Participant narratives indicated intense experiences characterized by disruptions in vestibular and interoceptive signals (e.g., change in spatial orientation, pressure on the body) and unusual and sometimes recurring themes across sessions such as revisiting childhood memories, cartoon-like imagery, and contact with entities. Under these prepared and supportive conditions, salvinorin A occasioned a unique profile of subjective effects having similarities to classic hallucinogens, including mystical-type effects.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"4094","Race and ethnicity moderate the associations between lifetime psychedelic use (MDMA/ecstasy and psilocybin) and major depressive episodes.^\nBackground: Psychedelics are receiving renewed attention within Western medicine as they represent potential treatments for many difficult-to-treat mental health disorders. However, psychedelic science is limited in its focus and inclusion of racial and ethnic minorities. Hence, this study examines whether race and ethnicity moderate the associations that naturalistic 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)/ecstasy use and psilocybin use share with major depressive episodes (MDEs). Method: Data for this project are from The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2005–2019). Participants were adults aged 18 years and older (unweighted N = 596,187). This study used multivariable logistic regression to test the interaction between race and ethnicity and MDMA/ecstasy use and psilocybin use for predicting lifetime, past year, and past year severe MDEs. Results: Race and ethnicity significantly moderated the associations between MDMA/ecstasy use and psilocybin use and MDEs. For White participants, MDMA/ecstasy use and psilocybin use each were associated with lowered odds of all three MDE outcomes (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) range: 0.82–0.92). For Hispanic participants, MDMA/ecstasy use and psilocybin use each conferred lowered odds of only a past year MDE (MDMA/ecstasy aOR: 0.82; psilocybin aOR: 0.79). For Non-Hispanic Racial Minority participants, MDMA/ecstasy and psilocybin use did not confer lowered odds of any MDE outcomes. Conclusion: Race and ethnicity have an impact on the associations that psychedelics share with mental health outcomes. Future research should explore the impact of identity and discrimination on the effects of psychedelics and should explore whether these substances can serve as effective treatments for minorities when used in culturally informed contexts.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"4424","Psychedelic therapy for depressive symptoms: A systematic review and meta-analysis.^\nBACKGROUND: Psychedelic therapy shows promise for Major Depressive Disorder, especially when treatment-resistant, as well as life-threatening illness distress. The objective of this systematic review, inclusive of meta-analysis, is to examine recent clinical research on the therapeutic effects of classic psychedelics on depressive symptoms. METHODS: Fourteen psychedelic therapy studies, utilising psilocybin, ayahuasca, or LSD, were systematically reviewed. For the meta-analysis, standardised mean differences were calculated for seven randomised controlled trials. RESULTS: The systematic review indicated significant short- and long-term reduction of depressive symptoms in all conditions studied after administration of psilocybin, ayahuasca, or LSD, with psychological support. In the meta-analysis, symptom reduction was significantly indicated in three timepoints out of four, including 1-day, 1-week, and 3-5 weeks, supporting the results of the systematic review, with the exception of the 6-8 weeks follow-up point which was less conclusive. LIMITATIONS: The absence of required data for 2 studies necessitated the less precise use of graphical extraction and imputation. The small sample size in all but one study negatively affected the statistical power. None of the studies had long-term follow-up without also utilising the cross-over method, which did not allow for long-term results to be included in the meta-review. CONCLUSIONS: This review indicates an association between psychedelic therapy and significant reduction of depressive symptoms at several time points. However, the small number of studies, and low sample sizes, calls for careful interpretation of results. This suggests the need for more randomised clinical trials of psychedelic therapy, with larger and more diverse samples.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

Placebo, low (1.0 mg/kg), and high (1.6 mg/kg) doses of oral MDMA were administered in a controlled inpatient setting at least 7 days apart to 6 African American (4 male, 2 female) and 2 white (both male) volunteers (mean [SE] age, 21.1 [0.8] years; weight, 77.2 [7.7] kg). 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine doses were 46 to 150 mg, in the range of typical recreational doses. Participants completed all sessions without clinically significant adverse events. 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine produced significant dose-dependent increases in heart rate (highest, 132 bpm), systolic (highest, 171 mm Hg) and diastolic (highest, 102 mm Hg) blood pressure, and subjective responses for energy level, closeness to others, mind racing, heightened senses, and high (evaluated by visual analog scales). Peak effects occurred 1 to 2 hours after dose, with no secondary peak. There were no significant effects on body temperature (measured at tympanic membrane), respiratory rate, or blood oxygen saturation (by pulse oximetry). Although most physiological and subjective parameters were significantly correlated with MDMA plasma concentrations, correlation coefficients were low and clinically insignificant, eliminating the ability to predict effects from single plasma concentrations. These findings suggest that oral MDMA in typical recreational doses produces short-term effects on cardiovascular function and subjective state but that temperature effects may result from interaction with environmental and subject factors.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"4635","Inhibition of MDMA-induced increase in cortisol does not prevent acute impairment of verbal memory.^\nBACKGROUND: Ecstasy use is commonly linked with memory deficits in abstinent ecstasy users. Similar impairments are being found during ecstasy intoxication after single doses of ± 3,4 metylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). The concordance of memory impairments during intoxication and abstinence suggests a similar neuropharmacological mechanism underlying acute and chronic memory impairments. The mechanism underlying this impairment is to date not known. We hypothesized that cortisol might play an important role in this mechanism as cortisol, implicated in the regulation of memory performance, can be brought out of balance by stressors like MDMA. METHODS: In the present study, we aimed to block the MDMA-induced acute memory defect by giving participants a cortisol synthesis inhibitor (metyrapone) together with a single dose of MDMA. Seventeen polydrug MDMA users entered this placebo-controlled within subject study with four treatment conditions. The treatments consisted of MDMA (75 mg) and metyrapone (750 mg), alone and in combination, and double placebo. Pre-treatment with metyrapone or Placebo occurred 1 h prior to MDMA or Placebo administration. Memory performance was tested at peak drug concentrations by means of several memory tests. Cortisol levels were determined in blood and oral fluid; this served as a control measure to see whether manipulations were effective. RESULTS: Main findings indicated that whereas treatment with metyrapone blocked the expected MDMA-induced increase in cortisol levels in blood, it did not prevent the MDMA-induced memory deficit from happening. CONCLUSION: We therefore conclude that MDMA-induced increments in cortisol concentrations are not related to MDMA-induced memory impairments.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

The study involved three group preparatory sessions, one high-dose (25 mg) group psilocybin session, and three group integration sessions with cohorts of four participants over a three-week intervention. RESULTS: Twelve participants completed the trial. no serious adverse events attributed to psilocybin occurred. The primary clinical outcome measures of change in symptoms of depression on the clinician administered 17-item-HAM-D showed clinically substantial decrease in HAM-D scores from baseline to the two-week timepoint (21.5-10.09, P < 0.001) and the 26-week timepoint (21.5-14.83, P = 0.006).

To refine our understanding of the role of BDNF, we performed a secondary analysis to explore whether the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism is associated with treatment response to either exposure-based CBT or ketamine. Given the BDNF Met allele impairs activity-dependent BDNF secretion that is critical for extinction learning, we hypothesized that patients without the BDNF Met allele would have a better OCD outcome than BDNF Met allele carriers. In this first study examining the association between the BDNF Val66Met SNP and treatment response to ketamine and CBT in OCD, there were two main findings: (1) BDNF variation was not associated with acute ketamine response on the infusion day; (2) BDNF variation was associated with differential response rate to subsequent brief, two-week, exposure-based CBT.

Results from the Canadian Rapid Treatment Center of Excellence.^\nBACKGROUND: Higher body mass index (BMI) has been found to predict greater antidepressant response to intravenous (IV) ketamine treatment. We evaluated the association between BMI and response to repeat-dose IV ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). METHODS: Adults (N = 230) with TRD received four infusions of IV ketamine at a community-based clinic. Changes in symptoms of depression (ie, Quick Inventory for Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report 16; QIDS-SR16), suicidal ideation (SI; ie, QIDS-SR16 SI item), anxiety (ie, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale), anhedonic severity (ie, Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale), and functioning (ie, Sheehan Disability Scale) following infusions were evaluated. Participants were stratified by BMI as normal (18.0-24.9 kg/m2; n = 72), overweight (25-29.9 kg/m2; n = 76), obese I (30-34.9 kg/m2; n = 47), or obese II (≥35.0 kg/m2; n = 35).

The prevalence of postpartum blues and postpartum depression were significantly lower in the ketamine group than in the control group. Logistic analysis showed that ketamine administration protected against postpartum depression, and PPD-associated risk factors included stress during pregnancy, antenatal depressive symptom and antenatal suicidal ideation. In addition, the antidepressive effect of prophylactic ketamine was stronger in mothers with a history of moderate stress during pregnancy, antenatal depressive symptom and antenatal suicidal ideation.

We sought to examine the long-term effects of consumption on depression in a group of individuals who had consumed large quantities of the drug in the past, but were now leading relatively drug free lives. Respondents to this study (n = 29) had consumed an average of 1.5 ecstasy tablets in the last month, 8.4 in the last 6 months and 23.3 in the last 12 months. The estimated total consumed was 527 tablets, indicating that these respondents were indeed former chronic users of the drug. None of the respondents had consumed ecstasy in the last 14 days. Levels of depression (Beck's Depression Inventory) were significantly (p < 0.01) elevated compared to a matched non-drug using control group. Within the group of former chronic users, these levels of depression were not significantly affected by current use of alcohol, cannabis or amphetamine, but were positively correlated with an external locus of control (p < 0.05), infrequent but severe- (p < 0.05) and frequent but mild- (p < 0.005) self-report measures of life stress. Multiple regression indicated that levels of frequent but mild life stress (p < 0.005) and the quantity of ecstasy tablets respondents consumed over a 12-h period (p < 0.05) were the only variables that were significant predictors of self-reported levels of depression.

"5545","Anxiety, depression, and behavioral symptoms of executive dysfunction in ecstasy users: Contributions of polydrug use.^\nBackground: Given ecstasy's (MDMA) potential serotonergic neurotoxicity, it is plausible that regular ecstasy users would have an elevated prevalence of behavioral executive dysfunction or mood symptoms. However, recent studies have found that the relationship between ecstasy use and psychological symptoms was no longer significant after controlling for marijuana use (e.g., Morgan et al., 2002). The goal of the present study was to examine the relationship between ecstasy exposure and self-reported executive functioning and psychological symptoms after controlling for gender, ethnicity, and other drug use. Methods: Data were collected from 65 men and women with a wide range of ecstasy use (including 17 marijuana-using controls). Participants were administered the Frontal Systems Behavioral Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for adults, and the Beck Depression Inventory-2nd edition. Results: Although 19-63% of the ecstasy users demonstrated clinically elevated psychological symptoms, frequency of ecstasy use did not predict the psychological symptoms. No gender differences or interactions were observed. Conclusions: These results revealed that, although ecstasy users demonstrate elevated levels of psychological symptoms and executive dysfunction, these symptoms are not statistically associated with their ecstasy consumption. Instead, other drug use (alcohol, marijuana, opioids, and inhalants) significantly predict psychological symptoms in this sample of polydrug users. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

"5597","Therapeutic mechanisms of psilocybin: Changes in amygdala and prefrontal functional connectivity during emotional processing after psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Psilocybin has shown promise as a treatment for depression but its therapeutic mechanisms are not properly understood. In contrast to the presumed actions of antidepressants, we recently found increased amygdala responsiveness to fearful faces one day after open-label treatment with psilocybin (25 mg) in 19 patients with treatment-resistant depression, which correlated with treatment efficacy. AIMS: Aiming to further unravel the therapeutic mechanisms of psilocybin, the present study extends this basic activation analysis. We hypothesised changed amygdala functional connectivity, more precisely decreased amygdala-ventromedial prefrontal cortex functional connectivity, during face processing after treatment with psilocybin. METHODS: Psychophysiological interaction analyses were conducted on functional magnetic resonance imaging data from a classic face/emotion perception task, with the bilateral amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex time-series as physiological regressors. Average parameter estimates (beta weights) of significant clusters were correlated with clinical outcomes at one week. RESULTS: Results showed decreased ventromedial prefrontal cortex-right amygdala functional connectivity during face processing post- (versus pre-) treatment; this decrease was associated with levels of rumination at one week. This effect was driven by connectivity changes in response to fearful and neutral (but not happy) faces. Independent whole-brain analyses also revealed a post-treatment increase in functional connectivity between the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex to occipital-parietal cortices during face processing. CONCLUSION: These results are consistent with the idea that psilocybin therapy revives emotional responsiveness on a neural and psychological level, which may be a key treatment mechanism for psychedelic therapy. Future larger placebo-controlled studies are needed to examine the replicability of the current findings.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"

This controlled study aimed to analyse the predictive and discriminative power of heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) for ketamine treatment in MDD. METHODS: In 51 patients, HR and HRV were assessed at baseline before and during ketamine infusion and 24 hours post ketamine infusion. Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was used to assess changes of depressive symptoms. A 30% or 50% reduction of symptoms after 24 hours or within 7 days was defined as response. A linear mixed model was used for analysis. RESULTS: Ketamine infusion increased HR and HRV power during and after infusion. Responders to ketamine showed a higher HR during the whole course of investigation, including at baseline with medium effect sizes (Cohen's d = 0.47-0.67). Furthermore, HR and HRV power discriminated between responders and non-responders, while normalized low and high frequencies did not. CONCLUSION: The findings show a predictive value of HR and HRV power for ketamine treatment. This further underlines the importance of the autonomous nervous system (ANS) and its possible malfunctions in MDD. SIGNIFICANCE: The predictive power of HR and HRV markers should be studied in prospective studies. Neurophysiological markers could improve treatment for MDD via optimizing the choice of treatments.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"5644","Assessment of Relationship of Ketamine Dose With Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy of Glx and GABA Responses in Adults With Major Depression: A Randomized Clinical Trial.^\nIMPORTANCE: A single subanesthetic dose of ketamine produces an antidepressant response in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) within hours, but the mechanism of antidepressant effect is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether ketamine dose and brain glutamate and glutamine (Glx) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) level responses to ketamine are related to antidepressant benefit and adverse effects. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized, parallel-group, triple-masked clinical trial included 38 physically healthy, psychotropic medication-free adult outpatients who were in a major depressive episode of MDD but not actively suicidal. The trial was conducted at Columbia University Medical Center. Data were collected from February 2012 to May 2015. Data analysis was conducted from January to March 2020. INTERVENTION: Participants received 1 dose of placebo or ketamine (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, or 0.5 mg/kg) intravenously during 40 minutes of a proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy scan that measured ventro-medial prefrontal cortex Glx and GABA levels in 13-minute data frames. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinical improvement was measured using a 22-item version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-22) 24 hours after ketamine was administered. Ketamine and metabolite blood levels were measured after the scan. RESULTS: A total of 38 individuals participated in the study, with a mean (SD) age of 38.6 (11.2) years, 23 (60.5%) women, and 25 (65.8%) White patients. Improvement in HDRS-22 score at 24 hours correlated positively with ketamine dose (t36 = 2.81; P = .008; slope estimate, 19.80 [95% CI, 5.49 to 34.11]) and blood level (t36 = 2.25; P = .03; slope estimate, 0.070 [95% CI, 0.007 to 0.133]). The lower the Glx response, the better the antidepressant response (t33 = -2.400; P = .02; slope estimate, -9.85 [95% CI, -18.2 to -1.50]). Although GABA levels correlated with Glx (t33 = 8.117; P < .001; slope estimate, 0.510 [95% CI, 0.382 to 0.638]), GABA response did not correlate with antidepressant effect. When both ketamine dose and Glx response were included in a mediation analysis model, ketamine dose was no longer associated with antidepressant effect, indicating that Glx response mediated the relationship. Adverse effects were related to blood levels in men only (t5 = 2.606; P = .048; estimated slope, 0.093 [95% CI, 0.001 to 0.186]), but Glx and GABA response were not related to adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, intravenous ketamine dose and blood levels correlated positively with antidepressant response. The Glx response correlated inversely with ketamine dose and with antidepressant effect. Future studies are needed to determine whether the relationship between Glx level and antidepressant effect is due to glutamate or glutamine.

"6028","Pharmacological Interaction Between Doxazosin and Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA).^\n3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""ecstasy"") is widely used by young people for its euphoric effects. MDMA releases serotonin (5‐HT), dopamine, and norepinephrine (NE). NE release is thought to mediate the cardiovascular effects of MDMA and may also contribute to its psychostimulant effects. However, the functional role of adrenergic postsynaptic receptors in the cardiovascular and subjective effects of MDMA in humans is largely unclear. To determine the role of alpha‐adrenergic receptors in the response to MDMA in humans the investigators test the effects of the alpha1‐receptor blocker doxazosin on the physiological and subjective effects of MDMA. The investigators use a randomized double‐blind placebo‐controlled cross‐over design with four experimental sessions. doxazosin or placebo will be administered before MDMA or placebo to 16 healthy volunteers. Subjective and cardiovascular responses will be repeatedly assessed throughout the experiments and plasma samples are collected for pharmacokinetics. The primary hypothesis is that doxazosin will significantly reduce the blood pressure response to MDMA.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"6035","Randomized, Double-blind, Active-placebo Controlled Study of MDMA-assisted Psychotherapy in People With Chronic PTSD.^\nPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating disorder that develops after people undergo a traumatic event, such as a rape, car accident or other life‐threatening event. PTSD is a worldwide health problem. Psychotherapy or drugs are used to treat PTSD, but there is an interest in developing other treatment options. 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)‐assisted psychotherapy is one potential treatment. MDMA is known as the active ingredient in ""ecstasy."" It was used along with psychotherapy to treat people in the past, and a study suggests that MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy might help people with PTSD. This Phase 2 research study will investigate the safety and efficacy of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy in 10 people with chronic, treatment‐resistant posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). After open‐label lead‐in in two subjects there will be a randomized, double‐blind arm comparing 125 vs. 25 mg MDMA in eight participants, and an open‐label arm for participants who received active placebo. In this study, five people will be randomly assigned to receive the full dose of 125 and 62.5 mg MDMA and three will be randomized to receive the active placebo dose of 25 and 125. mg MDMA. MDMA will be administered during two six to eight hour long experimental sessions scheduled three to five weeks apart. Study subjects will have a medical and psychiatric examination and a measure of their PTSD symptoms to make sure they meet the criteria to be in the study. Subjects must be in good physical health. They will also complete questionnaires about their PTSD symptoms, symptoms of depression and sleep quality. These tests will be given by a researcher who will not be present during any of the therapy sessions. This same researcher will give the subject the same tests or measures two months after the second experimental session and 12 months after a final experimental session. Once enrolled, subjects will have three preparatory sessions with a team of two therapists, one male and one female. The same team of therapists will work with them throughout the entire study. The subject will learn more about MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy and the therapists will learn more about the subject's goals, hopes and fears. Starting from the second preparatory session, subjects will answer questions on thoughts about hurting or killing themselves; these questions will be asked during face to face contact this and on two of the contact days, which may occur over the telephone. Subjects will have to stop taking their psychiatric medication before they have their first experimental session, with exact times dependent upon the specific medications involved. Subjects and the therapists, but not the person measuring symptoms, will find out if the subject had the active placebo or full dose of MDMA at this time, and if the subject had the active placebo, they can start the second arm of the study. What happens during this arm is very similar to the arm except that the subject and therapists will know the subject is getting a full dose of MDMA. Twelve months after the subject's final follow‐up visit (two months after their final experimental session), PTSD symptoms, symptoms of depression and sleep quality will be assessed again, and subjects will complete an additional questionnaire about their experiences during and after the study. The study will compare PTSD symptoms before and after MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy with a full dose and therapy with an active placebo dose of MDMA. Both therapists will be present for each experimental session. During experimental sessions, subjects will be encouraged to confront trauma‐related thoughts, feelings and memories. Blood pressure, heart rate (pulse) and body temperature will be measured regularly, and the researchers will periodically ask the subject to rate his or her degree of distress. Subjects will stay overnight at the clinic and have their first integrative session, where they will examine what happened during their experimental session. They will have two more integrative ses ions until they have their next experimental session. Subjects will fill out a questionnaire on their PTSD symptoms on every third integrative session. Two months after the second experimental session, subjects will answer questions or complete questionnaires about PTSD symptoms, symptoms of depression and sleep quality, and one of the researchers will assess their general psychological function.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"6121","A Multi-Site Phase 3 Study of MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy for PTSD II.^\nPTSD is a serious debilitating disorder that negatively impacts a person's daily life. PTSD is a stress‐related psychiatric condition that may occur following a traumatic event such as war, disaster, sexual abuse, violence, terrorism, and accidents. PTSD negatively impacts a person's daily life, resulting in relationship difficulties, difficulty in finding and maintaining a job, reduced cognitive and psychosocial functioning, substance abuse, high‐cost healthcare use, and increased depression and suicide risk. Available PTSD treatments, including medications and therapy, effectively treat only a fraction of people who try them for adequate dose and duration. People with PTSD can be treated with psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies. In the past decade, there has been a growing amount of research into medications and other methods that may augment the effectiveness of psychotherapy for PTSD. 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a drug that releases serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain and indirectly increases levels of the neurohormones oxytocin, arginine vasopressin and cortisol. The combined neurobiological effects of MDMA increase compassion, reduce defenses and fear of emotional injury, and enhance communication and introspection. MDMA produces anxiolytic and prosocial effects, which counteract avoidance and hyperarousal in the context of therapy. A combined treatment of MDMA and psychotherapy may be especially useful for treating PTSD. This multi‐site, double‐blind, randomized Phase 3 study assesses the efficacy and safety of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy versus psychotherapy with placebo control in participants diagnosed with at least severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The study will be conducted in N ≈ 100 participants. Participants will be enrolled in one of two groups at a 1:1 ratio. A flexible dose of MDMA or placebo, followed by a supplemental half‐dose unless contraindicated, is administered during the Treatment Period with manualized psychotherapy in three monthly Experimental Sessions. This 12‐week Treatment Period is preceded by three Preparatory Sessions. During the Treatment Period, each Experimental Session is followed by three Integrative Sessions of non‐drug psychotherapy. The Primary Outcome measure is change in Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM 5 (CAPS‐5) from Baseline. Exploratory measures will address specific symptoms, or behavior that is sometimes related to PTSD. Drug safety will be assessed by measuring blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature during experimental sessions, collecting adverse events and measuring suicidal thoughts or behaviors with the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS). This study will compare the effects of three manualized Experimental Sessions of psychotherapy supported by assisted by flexible doses of MDMA versus placebo. Initial doses per Experimental Session include 80 mg or 120 mg of MDMA compounded with mannitol and magnesium stearate or placebo alone (mannitol and magnesium stearate), followed 1.5 to 2 hours later by a supplemental half‐dose (40 or 60 mg).

METHODS: Single-centre, randomized, blinded trial of 147 patients. INTERVENTION: Perioperative S-ketamine bolus 0.5 mg/kg followed by S-ketamine 0.25 mg kg(-1)  hr(-1) infusion or placebo. MAIN OUTCOMES: Analgesic use, pain (visual analogue scale 0-100 mm [VAS]) and labour market attachment one year after surgery assessed by written questionnaires. RESULTS: Response rate was 67%. One year after surgery, the daily use of oral morphine equivalents was lower in the ketamine group versus the placebo group: 0 (0-20) mg versus 20 (0-62) mg, (p = 0.02), and fewer patients had a daily use of any analgesics in the ketamine group versus placebo group, 42% (95% CI 23-61) versus 74% (95% CI 58-87), (p = 0.04). Mobilization pain was lower in the ketamine group compared to the placebo group: Median difference 17 mm (95% CI -30 to -3), (p = 0.02). Pain at rest was lower in the ketamine group compared to the placebo group with median difference: 13 mm (95% CI -23 to -3), (p = 0.01). Further, labour market attachment was better in the ketamine group, (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Intraoperative ketamine may reduce analgesic use, pain, and improve labour market attachment one year after spine surgery in a chronic opioid-dependent population.

"6450","Neural correlates of rapid antidepressant response to ketamine in bipolar disorder.^\nOBJECTIVES: Ketamine, an N-methyl d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, has rapid antidepressant effects in depressed subjects with bipolar disorder (BD). Evidence supports a role for the glutamatergic system in the pathophysiology of BD. This double-blind, randomized, cross-over study sought to determine cerebral metabolic correlates of antidepressant response to ketamine. METHODS: Twenty-one subjects with BD currently in a depressed state underwent [(18) F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging after receiving a placebo infusion as well as after receiving a ketamine infusion. Metabolism was compared between ketamine and placebo infusions, and correlated with clinical response. Regional metabolic rate of glucose (rMRGlu) in regions of interest (ROIs) and Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores were the main outcome measures. RESULTS: The study found that change in metabolism between sessions was significantly correlated with percentage change in MADRS scores in the right ventral striatum; subjects who showed the greatest improvement had the largest metabolic increase after ketamine infusion compared to placebo. In a voxel-wise analysis, subjects with BD had significantly lower glucose metabolism in the left hippocampus following the ketamine infusion than following the placebo infusion. In addition, metabolism in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) following the placebo infusion was positively correlated with percentage improvement in MADRS score following the ketamine infusion. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the results suggest that higher activity in the subgenual ACC may predict antidepressant response to ketamine. Ketamine administration altered glucose metabolism in areas known to be involved in mood disorders; these alterations may partially underlie ketamine's mechanism of action.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"6723","Increased cortisol levels in hair of recent Ecstasy/MDMA users.^\nPrevious research has revealed an acute 8-fold increase in salivary cortisol following self-administrated Ecstasy/MDMA in dance clubbers. It is currently not known to what extent repeated usage impacts upon activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis over a more prolonged period of time. This study investigated the integrated cortisol levels in 3-month hair samples from recent Ecstasy/MDMA users and non-user controls. One hundred and one unpaid participants (53 males, 48 females; mean age 21.75 years) completed the University of East London recreational drug use questionnaire, modified to cover the past 3-months of usage. They comprised 32 light recent Ecstasy/MDMA users (1-4 times in last 3 months), 23 recent heavy MDMA users (+5 times in last 3 months), and 54 non-user controls. Volunteers provided 3. cm hair samples for cortisol analysis. Hair cortisol levels were observed to be significantly higher in recent heavy MDMA users (mean= 55.0±80.1. pg/mg), compared to recent light MDMA users (19.4±16.0. pg/mg; p=0.015), and to non-users (13.8±6.1. pg/mg; p<0.001). Hence the regular use of Ecstasy/MDMA was associated with almost 4-fold raised hair cortisol levels, in comparison with non-user controls. The present results are consistent with the bio-energetic stress model for Ecstasy/MDMA, which predicts that repeated stimulant drug use may increase cortisol production acutely, and result in greater deposits of the hormone in hair. These data may also help explain the neurocognitive, psychiatric, and other psychobiological problems of some abstinent users.

"7041","Pharmacological effects of methylone and MDMA in humans.^\nMethylone is one of the most common synthetic cathinones popularized as a substitute for 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, midomafetamine) owing to its similar effects among users. Both psychostimulants exhibit similar chemistry (i.e., methylone is a β-keto analog of MDMA) and mechanisms of action. Currently, the pharmacology of methylone remains scarcely explored in humans. Herein, we aimed to evaluate the acute pharmacological effects of methylone and its abuse potential in humans when compared with that of MDMA following oral administration under controlled conditions. Seventeen participants of both sexes (14 males, 3 females) with a previous history of psychostimulant use completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial. Participants received a single oral dose of 200 mg of methylone, 100 mg of MDMA, and a placebo. The variables included physiological effects (blood pressure, heart rate, oral temperature, pupil diameter), subjective effects using visual analog scales (VAS), the short form of the Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI), the Evaluation of Subjective Effects of Substances with Abuse Potential questionnaire (VESSPA-SSE), and the Sensitivity to Drug Reinforcement Questionnaire (SDRQ), and psychomotor performance (Maddox wing, psychomotor vigilance task). We observed that methylone could significantly increase blood pressure and heart rate and induce pleasurable effects, such as stimulation, euphoria, wellbeing, enhanced empathy, and altered perception. Methylone exhibited an effect profile similar to MDMA, with a faster overall onset and earlier disappearance of subjective effects. These results suggest that abuse potential of methylone is comparable to that of MDMA in humans.

"7083","Exploring the effect of microdosing psychedelics on creativity in an open-label natural setting.^\nINTRODUCTION: Taking microdoses (a mere fraction of normal doses) of psychedelic substances, such as truffles, recently gained popularity, as it allegedly has multiple beneficial effects including creativity and problem-solving performance, potentially through targeting serotonergic 5-HT(2A) receptors and promoting cognitive flexibility, crucial to creative thinking. Nevertheless, enhancing effects of microdosing remain anecdotal, and in the absence of quantitative research on microdosing psychedelics, it is impossible to draw definitive conclusions on that matter. Here, our main aim was to quantitatively explore the cognitive-enhancing potential of microdosing psychedelics in healthy adults. METHODS: During a microdosing event organized by the Dutch Psychedelic Society, we examined the effects of psychedelic truffles (which were later analyzed to quantify active psychedelic alkaloids) on two creativity-related problem-solving tasks: the Picture Concept Task assessing convergent thinking and the Alternative Uses Task assessing divergent thinking. A short version of the Ravens Progressive Matrices task assessed potential changes in fluid intelligence. We tested once before taking a microdose and once while the effects were expected to be manifested. RESULTS: We found that both convergent and divergent thinking performance was improved after a non-blinded microdose, whereas fluid intelligence was unaffected. CONCLUSION: While this study provides quantitative support for the cognitive-enhancing properties of microdosing psychedelics, future research has to confirm these preliminary findings in more rigorous placebo-controlled study designs. Based on these preliminary results, we speculate that psychedelics might affect cognitive metacontrol policies by optimizing the balance between cognitive persistence and flexibility. We hope this study will motivate future microdosing studies with more controlled designs to test this hypothesis.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"7318","Chronic ketamine use increases serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor.^\nRationale: Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist which interferes with the action of excitatory amino acids (EAAs) including glutamate and aspartate. The use of ketamine at subanaesthetic doses has increased because of its psychotomimetic properties. However, long-term ketamine abuse may interfere with memory processes and inhibit the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus, an effect probably mediated by its NMDA antagonist action. Neurotrophins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) serve as survival factors for selected populations of central nervous system neurons, including cholinergic and dopaminergic neurons. In addition, neurotrophins, particularly BDNF, may regulate LTP in the hippocampus and influence synaptic plasticity. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that ketamine use in humans is associated with altered serum levels of neurotrophins. Methods: We measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay the NGF and BDNF serum levels in two groups of subjects: frequent ketamine users and healthy subjects. Results: Our data show that BDNF serum levels were increased in chronic ketamine users as compared to healthy subjects, while NGF levels were not affected by ketamine use. Conclusion: These findings suggest that chronic ketamine intake is associated with increases in BDNF serum levels in humans. Other studies are needed to explore the pharmacological and molecular mechanism by which ketamine, and/or other NMDA antagonists, may induce modification in the production and utilization of BDNF and alter normal brain function.

The main effect suggested ecstasy/MDMA related SERT reductions (SMD = 0.52, 95% CIs [0.40, 0.65]; Z = 8.36, p < .01, I2 = 89%). A significant effect of subgroups (X2 = 37.41, df = 13, p < .01, I2 = 65.3%) suggested differential effects across brain ROIs. Ecstasy users showed significant SERT reductions in 11 out of the 14 regions, including every neocortical and limbic region analysed. Greatest effects were observed in the occipital cortex (SMD = 1.09, 95% CIs [0.70, 1.48]). No group effects were observed in subcortical areas of the caudate, putamen and midbrain. Literature on Postsynaptic 5HT2A receptor imaging was synthesised with these results.

"7460","Microdosing psychedelics: Demographics, practices, and psychiatric comorbidities.^\nRATIONALE: Microdosing psychedelics - the practice of consuming small, sub-hallucinogenic doses of substances such as LSD or psilocybin - is gaining attention in popular media but remains poorly characterized. Contemporary studies of psychedelic microdosing have yet to report the basic psychiatric descriptors of psychedelic microdosers. OBJECTIVES: To examine the practices and demographics of a population of psychedelic microdosers - including their psychiatric diagnoses, prescription medications, and recreational substance use patterns - to develop a foundation on which to conduct future clinical research. METHODS: Participants (n = 909; M(age) = 26.9, SD = 8.6; male = 83.2%; White/European = 79.1%) recruited primarily from the online forum Reddit completed an anonymous online survey. Respondents who reported using LSD, psilocybin, or both for microdosing were grouped and compared with non-microdosing respondents using exploratory odds ratio testing on demographic variables, rates of psychiatric diagnoses, and past-year recreational substance use. RESULTS: Of microdosers, most reported using LSD (59.3%; M(dose) = 13 mcg, or 11.3% of one tab) or psilocybin (25.9%; M(dose) = 0.3 g of dried psilocybin mushrooms) on a one-day-on, two-days-off schedule. Compared with non-microdosers, microdosers were significantly less likely to report a history of substance use disorders (SUDs; OR = 0.17 (95% CI: 0.05-0.56)) or anxiety disorders (OR = 0.61 (95% CI: 0.41-0.91)). Microdosers were also more likely to report recent recreational substance use compared with non-microdosers (OR = 5.2 (95% CI: 2.7-10.8)).

"7980","Prolonged ketamine infusion modulates limbic connectivity and induces sustained remission of treatment-resistant depression.^\nKetamine produces a rapid antidepressant response in over 50% of adults with treatment-resistant depression. A long infusion of ketamine may provide durable remission of depressive symptoms, but the safety, efficacy, and neurobiological correlates are unknown. In this open-label, proof-of-principle study, adults with treatment-resistant depression (N = 23) underwent a 96-h infusion of intravenous ketamine (0.15 mg/kg/h titrated toward 0.6 mg/kg/h). Clonidine was co-administered to reduce psychotomimetic effects. We measured clinical response for 8 weeks post-infusion. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess functional connectivity in patients pre- and 2 weeks post-infusion and in matched non-depressed controls (N = 27). We hypothesized that responders to therapy would demonstrate response-dependent connectivity changes while all subjects would show treatment-dependent connectivity changes. Most participants completed infusion (21/23; mean final dose 0.54 mg/kg/h, SD 0.13). The infusion was well tolerated with minimal cognitive and psychotomimetic side effects. Depressive symptoms were markedly reduced (MADRS 29 ± 4 at baseline to 9 ± 8 one day post-infusion), which was sustained at 2 weeks (13 ± 8) and 8 weeks (15 ± 8). Imaging demonstrated a response-dependent decrease in hyperconnectivity of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex to the default mode network, and a treatment-dependent decrease in hyperconnectivity within the limbic system (hippocampus, amygdala, medial thalamus, nucleus accumbens). In exploratory analyses, connectivity was increased between the limbic system and frontal areas, and smaller right hippocampus volume at baseline predicted larger MADRS change. A single prolonged infusion of ketamine provides a tolerated, rapid, and sustained response in treatment-resistant depression and normalizes depression-related hyperconnectivity in the limbic system and frontal lobe.

"8031","Associations between lifetime classic psychedelic use and markers of physical health.^\nBackground: In recent years, there has been significant research on the mental health effects of classic psychedelic use, but there is very little evidence on how classic psychedelics might influence physical health. Aims: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the associations between lifetime classic psychedelic use and markers of physical health. Methods: Using data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2015-2018) with 171,766 (unweighted) adults aged 18 or above in the United States, the current study examined the associations between lifetime classic psychedelic use and three markers of physical health (self-reported overall health, body mass index, and heart condition and/or cancer in the past 12 months) while controlling for a range of covariates. Results: Respondents who reported having tried a classic psychedelic at least once in their lifetime had significantly higher odds of greater self-reported overall health and significantly lower odds of being overweight or obese versus having a normal weight. The association between lifetime classic psychedelic use and having a heart condition and/or cancer in the past 12 months approached conventional levels of significance, with lower odds of having a heart condition and/or cancer in the past 12 months for respondents who had tried a classic psychedelic at least once. Conclusion: The results of the present study suggest that classic psychedelics may be beneficial to physical health. Future research should investigate the causal effects of classic psychedelics on physical health and evaluate possible mechanisms.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"8140","Problematic versus non-problematic ecstasy/MDMA use: The influence of drug usage patterns and pre-existing psychiatric factors.^\nRecreational ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine; MDMA) use has been increasingly associated with a number of psychiatric symptoms and psychological problems. However, previous studies assessing possible psychopathological effects have not identified whether users consider their ecstasy use 'problematic' or not. In addition, research has generally failed to address the potential role of premorbid psychiatric status. This study aimed to assess whether premorbid psychiatric history and/or patterns of ecstasy use would be associated with the degree of self-reported problems attributable to ecstasy. Problematic ecstasy users (n = 53) who had reported problems attributable to their ecstasy use were compared with non-problematic ecstasy users (n = 62), polydrug controls (n = 62) and illegal drug-naive controls (n = 111) on a recreational drug use questionnaire; a questionnaire, which ascertained personal and family psychiatric histories, and the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). Problematic ecstasy users exhibited significantly higher scores on a number of dimensions of the BSI compared to illegal drug-naive and/or polydrug controls. Problematic ecstasy users also exhibited significantly elevated scores on somatization, depression, anxiety and negative psychobiology compared to non-problematic ecstasy users. BSI scores for the non-problematic ecstasy users did not differ from polydrug or illegal drug-naive controls. Problematic ecstasy users reported significantly higher levels of ecstasy use, including lifetime consumption, average dosage and binge consumption compared to non-problematic ecstasy users. Additionally, a greater number of problematic ecstasy users reported personal and family psychiatric histories compared to controls and non-problematic ecstasy users. This study demonstrates two distinct ecstasy using groups: non-problematic ecstasy users who are not showing signs of psychopathology and problematic ecstasy users who are showing evidence of a range of symptoms. This data therefore partially supports the link between ecstasy dosage and negative psychological sequalae, but highlights the importance of the need to consider ecstasy-related attributions, pre-existing mental health status and vulnerability. © 2006 British Association for Psychopharmacology.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"8294","Evidence for a hallucinogen dependence syndrome developing soon after onset of hallucinogen use during adolescence.^\nThis study uses latent class methods and multiple regression to shed light on hypothesized hallucinogen dependence syndromes experienced by young people who have recently initiated hallucinogen use. It explores possible variation in risk. The study sample, identified within public-use data files of the 1999 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA), consists of 1186 recent-onset hallucinogen users, defined as having initiated hallucinogen use within 24 months of assessment (median elapsed time since onset of use ∼12 to 13 months). The recent-onset users in this sample were age 12 to 21 at the time of assessment and were between the ages of 10 and 21 at the time of their first hallucinogen use. The NHSDA included items to assess seven clinical features often associated with hallucinogen dependence, which were used in latent class modelling. Latent class analysis, in conjunction with prior theory, supports a three-class solution, with 2% of recent-onset users in a class that resembles a hallucinogen dependence syndrome, whereas 88% expressed few or no clinical features of dependence. The remaining 10% may reflect users who are at risk for dependence or in an early stage of dependence. Results from latent class regressions indicate that susceptibility to rapid transition from first hallucinogen use to onset of this hallucinogen dependence syndrome might be influenced by hallucinogenic compounds taken (for example, estimated relative risk, RR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.6, 7.6 for users of MDMA versus users of LSD). Excess risk of rapid transition did not appear to depend upon age, sex, or race/ethnicity. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"8307","The acute effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine and d-methamphetamine on human cognitive functioning.^\nRATIONALE: This study investigated the acute (3-h) and 24-h post-dose cognitive effects of oral 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), d-methamphetamine, and placebo in a within-subject double-blind laboratory-based study in order to compare the effect of these two commonly used illicit drugs on a large number of recreational drug users. METHODS: Sixty-one abstinent recreational users of illicit drugs comprised the participant sample, with 33 females and 28 males, mean age 25.45 years. The three testing sessions involved oral consumption of 100 mg MDMA, 0.42 mg/kg d-methamphetamine, or a matching placebo. The drug administration was counter-balanced, double-blind, and medically supervised. Cognitive performance was assessed during drug peak (3 h) and at 24 h post-dosing time-points. Blood samples were also taken to quantify the levels of drug present at the cognitive testing time-points. RESULTS: Blood concentrations of both methamphetamine and MDMA at drug peak samples were consistent with levels observed in previous studies. The major findings concern poorer performance in the MDMA condition at peak concentration for the trail-making measures and an index of working memory (trend level), and more accurate performance on a choice reaction task within the methamphetamine condition. Most of the differences in performance between the MDMA, methamphetamine, and placebo treatments diminished by the 24-h testing time-point, although some performance improvements subsisted for choice reaction time for the methamphetamine condition. CONCLUSIONS: Further research into the acute effects of amphetamine preparations is necessary to further quantify the acute disruption of aspects of human functioning crucial to complex activities such as attention, selective memory, and psychomotor performance.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

"8767","Structural connectivity and response to ketamine therapy in major depression: A preliminary study.^\nBackground: Ketamine elicits an acute antidepressant effect in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Here, we used diffusion imaging to explore whether regional differences in white matter microstructure prior to treatment may predict clinical response 24 h following ketamine infusion in 10 MDD patients. Methods: FSL's Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) established voxel-level differences in fractional anisotropy (FA) between responders (patients showing > 50% improvement in symptoms 24 h post-infusion) and non-responders in major white matter pathways. Follow-up regions-of-interest (ROI) analyses examined differences in FA and radial (RD), axial (AD) and mean diffusivity (MD) between responders and non-responders and 15 age- and sex-matched controls, with groups compared pairwise. Results: Whole brain TBSS (p < 0.05, corrected) and confirmatory tract-based regions-of-interest analyses showed larger FA values in the cingulum and forceps minor in responders compared to non-responders; complementary decreases in RD occurred in the cingulum (p < 0.05). Only non-responders differed from controls showing decreased FA in the forceps minor, increased RD in the cingulum and forceps minor, and increased MD in the forceps minor (p < 0.05). Limitations: Non-responders showed an earlier age of onset and longer current depressive episode than responders. Though these factors did not interact with diffusion metrics, results may be impacted by the limited sample size. Conclusions: Though findings are considered preliminary, significant differences in FA, RD and MD shown in non-responders compared to responders and controls in fronto-limbic and ventral striatal pathways suggest that the structural architecture of specific functional networks mediating emotion may predict ketamine response in MDD.

"9057","The use of the psychological flexibility model to support psychedelic assisted therapy.^\nPsychedelic assisted therapy comprises three stages: Preparation, Psychedelic Session, and Integration. Preparation is key for maximising the potential of a beneficial psychedelic experience and integration is important for prolonging improvements. The psychological flexibility model (PFM) appears to be a promising one to guide psychedelic preparation and integration. This paper proposes a model that utilises the PFM as informed by a previously published qualitative study of patient accounts of change processes in psilocybin therapy that identified themes of acceptance and connection as associated with positive outcomes. This new model, the ACE (Accept, Connect, Embody) model presents the six psychological flexibility processes, renamed and rearranged in an acceptance triad (defusion, present moment focus, willingness) and a connection triad (self as context, values, committed action). This paper describes the ACE model and how it is being used in an ongoing trial of psilocybin treatment for major depression. It also describes qualitative evidence supportive of the idea that psychological flexibility may be key to characterizing the processes of change involved in psilocybin assisted therapy for depression. These and other results suggest that psilocybin may be specifically increasing psychological flexibility and point to the possibility that psychotherapy approaches incorporating the PFM may serve as a means to deepen and extend the benefits of psilocybin treatment, thus bridging the experiential gap between a potent inner experience and an outer life better lived.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"9113","The effects of multitasking on psychological stress reactivity in recreational users of cannabis and MDMA.^\nBACKGROUND: Cannabis and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) use is associated with psychobiological and neurocognitive deficits. Assessments of the latter typically include tests of memory and everyday cognitive functioning. However, to date, little attention has been paid to effects of drug use on psychological stress reactivity. We report three studies examining the effects of recreational use of cannabis and MDMA on mood and psychological responses to multitasking using a cognitively demanding laboratory stressor that provides an analogue for everyday situations involving responses to multiple stimuli. METHODS: The effects of the multitasking framework on mood and perceived workload were assessed in cannabis (N=25), younger (N=18) and older (N=20) MDMA users and compared with non-target drug controls. RESULTS: Compared with respective control groups, cannabis users became less alert and content, and both MDMA groups became less calm following acute stress. Unexpectedly, the stressor increased ratings of calm in cannabis users. Users also scored higher than their controls with respect to ratings of resources needed to complete the multitasking framework. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show, for the first time, that recreational use of cannabis and MDMA, beyond the period of intoxication, can negatively influence psychological responses to a multitasking stressor, and this may have implications for real-life situations which place high demands on cognitive resources.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"9151","LSD, afterglow and hangover: Increased episodic memory and verbal fluency, decreased cognitive flexibility.^\nPsychedelics acutely impair cognitive functions, but these impairments decline with growing experiences with psychedelics and microdoses may even exert opposing effects. Given the recent evidence that psychedelics induce neuroplasticity, this explorative study aimed at investigating the potential of psychedelics to sub-acutely change cognition. For this, we applied a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study with 24 healthy volunteers receiving 50 μg lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) or an inactive placebo. Sub-acute changes in cognition were measured 24 h after dosing, including memory (Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure, ROCF; 2D Object-Location Memory Task, OLMT; Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test, RAVLT), verbal fluency (phonological; semantic; switch), design fluency (basic; filter; switch), cognitive flexibility (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, WCST), sustained and switching attention (Trail Making Test, TMT), inhibitory control (Stroop Task) and perceptual reasoning (Block Design Test, BDT). The results show that when compared to placebo and corrected for Body Mass Index (BMI) and abstinence period from psychedelics, LSD sub-acutely improved visuospatial memory (ROCF immediate recall points and percentage, OLMT consolidation percentage) and phonological verbal fluency and impaired cognitive flexibility (WCST: fewer categories achieved; more perseveration, errors and conceptual level responses). In conclusion, the low dose of LSD moderately induced both ""afterglow"" and ""hangover"". The improvements in visuospatial memory and phonological fluency suggest that LSD-assisted therapy should be explored as a novel treatment perspective in conditions involving memory and language declines such as brain injury, stroke or dementia.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"9446","Sex differences in 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy)-induced cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibition in humans.^\nBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy) is a ring-substituted amphetamine widely used for recreational purposes. MDMA is predominantly O-demethylenated in humans by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 and is also a potent mechanism-based inhibitor of the enzyme. This study assessed the inhibition and recovery half-life of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 activity in female subjects by administering the probe drug dextromethorphan before and repeatedly after MDMA administration. These data were compared with the data obtained from a previous study in male subjects. STUDY DESIGN: Twelve healthy female subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers participated as outpatients in two experimental sessions. Session 1 was conducted over 2 days and session 2 over 10 days, with a minimum of 3 days between sessions. In session 1, subjects received a single oral dose of dextromethorphan 30 mg. In session 2, a 1.5 mg/kg MDMA dose was given at 0 hours, followed at 4 hours by repeated 30 mg doses of dextromethorphan over the next 10 days. METHODS: Plasma concentration-time profiles and urinary recoveries of dextromethorphan and its metabolites dextrorphan (DOR), 3-methoxymorphinan (MM) and hydroxymorphinan-3-ol (HM) were measured. RESULTS: MDMA given prior to dextromethorphan resulted in a 10-fold increase in the dextromethorphan maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), with corresponding decreases in DOR and HM pharmacokinetic parameters. The mean ± SD C(max) of MDMA was 188.8 ± 16.7 ng/mL, with a time to reach C(max) (t(max)) of 2.0 ± 0.4 hours and an AUC from 0 to 25 hours of 2645.2 ± 170.9 mg · h/mL. The urinary recovery of the dextromethorphan dose as dextromethorphan and its main metabolites was 25.4 ± 8.9% with no MDMA pretreatment versus 6.6 ± 1.1% after 1.5 mg/kg of MDMA (p = 0.0001). The metabolic ratio (MR) increased almost 60-fold from 0.018 ± 0.028 to 0.998 ± 0.932 after MDMA administration, with 100% of the subjects having a value greater than the antimode of 0.3 that signified the poor-metabolizer phenotype. Data analysis of results obtained in the present study compared with those from a previous study in male subjects showed significant differences in the dextromethorphan/DOR MR in the 0- to 8-hour (session 1) and 4- to 12-hour (session 2, post MDMA) collection periods (p = 0.032 and p = 0.01, respectively). CYP2D6 activity recovered after 10 days to 90% of baseline activity, with a recovery half-life of 36.6 ± 22.9 hours. Male subjects showed a shorter recovery half-life (27.6 ± 25.1 hours). The measurement of CYP3A4 activity indicated a non-significant increase in C(max) and AUC values of MM after drug intake, but urinary data reflected significant differences in dextromethorphan/MM MR in both sexes, although the difference was more pronounced in women. Dextromethorphan/MM MR increased almost 3-fold from baseline. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In women the pretreatment with MDMA resulted in a decrease in dextromethorphan clearance. CYP2D6 activity recovered after 10 days to 90% of baseline activity. Regarding CYP3A4 activity, there is an apparent decrease in its activity after MDMA use. In women, MDMA use has been associated with psychiatric symptoms and psychological problems that may require psychopharmacological treatment with antidepressant drugs, some of which are known CYP2D6 substrates. MDMA-induced mechanism-based inhibition of CYP2D6 is of relevance, and physicians should be advised to prescribe medications whose metabolic disposition is not regulated by CYP2D6.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"9578","Changes in synaptic markers after administration of ketamine or psychedelics: a systematic scoping review.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine and psychedelics have abuse liability. They can also induce ""transformative experiences"" where individuals experience enhanced states of awareness. This enhanced awareness can lead to changes in preexisting behavioral patterns which could be beneficial in the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs). Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that ketamine and psychedelics may alter markers associated with synaptic density, and that these changes may underlie effects such as sensitization, conditioned place preference, drug self-administration, and verbal memory performance. In this scoping review, we examined studies that measured synaptic markers in animals and humans after exposure to ketamine and/or psychedelics. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted following PRISMA guidelines, through PubMed, EBSCO, Scopus, and Web of Science, based on a published protocol (Open Science Framework, DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/43FQ9). Both in vivo and in vitro studies were included. Studies on the following synaptic markers were included: dendritic structural changes, PSD-95, synapsin-1, synaptophysin-1, synaptotagmin-1, and SV2A. RESULTS: Eighty-four studies were included in the final analyses. Seventy-one studies examined synaptic markers following ketamine treatment, nine examined psychedelics, and four examined both. Psychedelics included psilocybin/psilocin, lysergic acid diethylamide, N,N-dimethyltryptamine, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine, and ibogaine/noribogaine. Mixed findings regarding synaptic changes in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) have been reported when ketamine was administered in a single dose under basal conditions. Similar mixed findings were seen under basal conditions in studies that used repeated administration of ketamine. However, studies that examined animals during stressful conditions found that a single dose of ketamine counteracted stress-related reductions in synaptic markers in the hippocampus and PFC. Repeated administration of ketamine also counteracted stress effects in the hippocampus. Psychedelics generally increased synaptic markers, but results were more consistently positive for certain agents. CONCLUSION: Ketamine and psychedelics can increase synaptic markers under certain conditions. Heterogeneous findings may relate to methodological differences, agents administered (or different formulations of the same agent), sex, and type of markers. Future studies could address seemingly mixed results by using meta-analytical approaches or study designs that more fully consider individual differences.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
