"3537","Gray matter volume of rostral anterior cingulate cortex predicts rapid antidepressant response to ketamine.^\nKetamine was recently approved for treatment resistant depression. However, despite its therapeutic potential, about 50% of patients do not show improvement under this therapy. In this prospective two-site study, we investigated baseline brain structural predictors for rapid symptom improvement after a single subanesthetic ketamine infusion. Furthermore, given the preclinical evidence and findings from a pilot study in a clinical population that ketamine induces rapid neuroplasticity, we performed an exploratory investigation of macroscopic changes 24 h post-treatment. T1-weighted MRI brain images from 33 depressed patients were acquired before and 24 h after a single ketamine infusion and analyzed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Additionally, we performed a region of interest (ROI)-based analysis of structures that have previously been shown to play a role in the antidepressant effects of ketamine: bilateral hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, anterior cingulate cortex, and thalamus. A whole-brain regression analysis showed that greater baseline volume of the bilateral rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) significantly predicts rapid symptom reduction. The right ACC showed the same association in the ROI analysis, while the other regions yielded no significant results. Exploratory follow-up analyses revealed no volumetric changes 24 h after treatment. This is the first study reporting an association between pretreatment gray matter volume of the bilateral rACC and the rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine. Results are in line with previous investigations, which highlighted the potential of the rACC as a biomarker for response prediction to different antidepressant treatments. Ketamine-induced volumetric changes may be seen at later time points. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"8889","Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"254","Efficacy and safety of ketamine in bipolar depression: A systematic review.^\nThe depression is the most prevalent state throughout the life of the bipolar patient. Ketamine has been shown to be an effective and rapid treatment for depression. The objective of the present work is to perform a systematic review on the efficacy and safety of ketamine as treatment of bipolar depression, as well as its different patterns of administration. The search found 10 relevant manuscripts that met the inclusion criteria: one clinical trial, 5 cohort studies, and 4 case reports. Intravenous infusion was used in 60% of the studies. According to data, ketamine seems to be an effective and safe treatment for bipolar depression, although the length of its effect is short. Adverse effects observed generally occurred at the time of infusion, and tended to completely disappear within 1-2h. Therefore, more studies are necessary to explore new patterns of administration, as well as on its safety and adverse effects.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"790","Behavioral Mechanisms Underlying the Therapeutic Effects of MDMA: evidence From Laboratory Studies in Healthy Human Volunteers.^\nBackground: MDMA, in combination with psychotherapy, has shown promise in the treatment of multiple psychiatric disorders. However, it is not known how MDMA interacts with components of the therapeutic process to produce its beneficial effects. We tested the effects of MDMA on four measures of social experience to elucidate the behavioral components that underlie the efficacy of MDMA in combination with psychotherapy. Methods: Healthy volunteers participated in two double‐blind placebo‐controlled studies using a within‐subjects crossover design. In Study 1 (N=36), they received MDMA (0.75mg/kg and 1.5mg/kg), methamphetamine (20mg), and placebo. In Study 2 (N=18 of 36), they received MDMA (125mg), methamphetamine (20mg), and placebo. During peak drug effect, they completed standardized tasks assessing social behavior. These tasks included a social attention bias task, an emotional response to social feedback task, an affective touch task, and a verbal task assessing synchrony of vocal pitch during a social interaction. Results: MDMA (1.5mg/kg) increased attention to faces expressing positive emotions compared to neutral faces (p<0.05). During the social feedback task, MDMA dose‐dependently increased feelings of social acceptance following all types of social feedback (p<0.05), and similarly increased pleasantness ratings of affective touch (p<0.05). Methamphetamine did not produce these effects. Conclusions: These findings build on previous reports that MDMA reduces responses to negative social stimuli by showing that the drug also enhances responses to positive social stimuli. The facilitatory effects of MDMA on social acceptance, affective touch, and attention to positive emotions may improve the patient‐therapist connection. Further studies are needed to extend these findings to clinical populations.

"1281","Current and former ecstasy users report different sleep to matched controls: A web-based questionnaire study.^\nThis study sought to test the association between ecstasy-use and abnormal sleep. An anonymous web-based questionnaire containing questions on drug use and sleep was completed by 1035 individuals. From this large sample, a group of 89 ecstasy users were found who reported very little use of other drugs. This ""ecstasy-only"" group was further divided into two groups of 31 current users and 58 abstinent users. The subjective sleep of current and former ecstasy-only users was compared with that of matched controls. Patients were asked to rate their sleep according to: 1) sleep quality, 2) sleep latency, 3) night time awakenings and 4) total sleep time. Current ecstasy-only users reported significantly worse sleep quality (P?<?0.05) and a greater total sleep time (P?<?0.001) than controls. It was inferred that these differences might be due to recovery from the acute effects of the drug. Abstinent ecstasy-only users reported significantly more nighttime awakenings than controls (P?<?0.01). These subjective findings are in agreement with the objective findings of previous studies showing persistent sleep abnormalities in ecstasy users. © 2009 British Association for Psychopharmacology.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]"
"6566","How does ayahuasca work from a psychiatric perspective? Pros and cons of the entheogenic therapy.^\nOBJECTIVE: Ayahuasca is a hallucinogenic plant preparation, traditionally consumed in sacred ceremonies by indigenous North-Westerner Amazonian countries like Colombia, Peru, Brazil, and Ecuador. It is fundamental to carefully balance benefits/risks related to the ayahuasca intake, both during ceremonies and experimental settings. The aim is at evaluating and comparing the potential therapeutic benefits versus health risks related to ayahuasca intake (both acutely and chronically), focusing on its application in psychedelic psychiatry. DESIGN: A comprehensive mini overview focusing on psychiatric outcomes following ayahuasca intake both in healthy volunteers and in clinical samples. RESULTS: Preclinical, observational, and experimental studies in healthy volunteers as well as in clinical samples suggest that ayahuasca may be beneficial as an antidepressant, emotional regulator, anxiolytic, and antiaddictive drug, by exerting fast-acting and enduring clinical effects. Ayahuasca appears to be safe and well tolerated, nausea and emesis being the most reported and transient side effects. Some findings suggest not to use ayahuasca in bipolar or psychotic patients because of an increased risk of manic switch and/or psychotic onset. CONCLUSIONS: Further research should be carried out in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, by implementing neuroimaging studies, in order to better evaluate therapeutic potential of ayahuasca in mental disorders.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"8878","Genetic influence of CYP2D6 on pharmacokinetics and acute subjective effects of LSD in a pooled analysis.^\nLysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a classic psychedelic substance that is used recreationally and investigated in psychiatric research. There are no pharmacogenetic studies on LSD. In vitro metabolic studies indicate that several cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms (e.g., CYP2D6, CYP1A2, and CYP2C9) are involved in LSD metabolism, but in vivo data are scarce. The present study examined the influence of genetic polymorphisms of CYP genes on the pharmacokinetics and acute effects of LSD in healthy subjects. We identified common genetic variants of CYPs (CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2B6) in 81 healthy subjects who were pooled from four randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 1 studies. We found that genetically determined CYP2D6 functionality significantly influenced the pharmacokinetics of LSD. Individuals with no functional CYP2D6 (i.e., poor metabolizers) had longer LSD half-lives and approximately 75% higher parent drug and main metabolite 2-oxo-3-hydroxy LSD area-under-the-curve blood plasma concentrations compared with carriers of functional CYP2D6. Non-functional CYP2D6 metabolizers also exhibited greater alterations of mind and longer subjective effect durations in response to LSD compared with functional CYP2D6 metabolizers. No effect on the pharmacokinetics or acute effects of LSD were observed with other CYPs. These findings indicate that genetic polymorphisms of CYP2D6 significantly influence the pharmacokinetic and subjective effects of LSD. Given the potential therapeutic use of psychedelics, including LSD, the role of pharmacogenetic tests prior to LSD-assisted psychotherapy needs to be further investigated.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"3216","Ketamine for Rapid Reduction of Suicidal Thoughts in Major Depression: A Midazolam-Controlled Randomized Clinical Trial.^\nOBJECTIVE: Pharmacotherapy to rapidly relieve suicidal ideation in depression may reduce suicide risk. Rapid reduction in suicidal thoughts after ketamine treatment has mostly been studied in patients with low levels of suicidal ideation. The authors tested the acute effect of adjunctive subanesthetic intravenous ketamine on clinically significant suicidal ideation in patients with major depressive disorder. METHOD: In a randomized clinical trial, adults (N=80) with current major depressive disorder and a score ≥4 on the Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI), of whom 54% (N=43) were taking antidepressant medication, were randomly assigned to receive ketamine or midazolam infusion. The primary outcome measure was SSI score 24 hours after infusion (at day 1). RESULTS: The reduction in SSI score at day 1 was 4.96 points greater for the ketamine group compared with the midazolam group (95% CI=2.33, 7.59; Cohen's d=0.75). The proportion of responders (defined as having a reduction ≥50% in SSI score) at day 1 was 55% for the ketamine group and 30% for the midazolam group (odds ratio=2.85, 95% CI=1.14, 7.15; number needed to treat=4.0). Improvement in the Profile of Mood States depression subscale was greater at day 1 for the ketamine group compared with the midazolam group (estimate=7.65, 95% CI=1.36, 13.94), and this effect mediated 33.6% of ketamine's effect on SSI score. Side effects were short-lived, and clinical improvement was maintained for up to 6 weeks with additional optimized standard pharmacotherapy in an uncontrolled follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive ketamine demonstrated a greater reduction in clinically significant suicidal ideation in depressed patients within 24 hours compared with midazolam, partially independently of antidepressant effect.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"6357","Riluzole likely lacks antidepressant efficacy in ketamine non-responders.^\nBackground: In our primary analysis of a four‐week riluzole extension trial after open‐label ketamine in treatment‐resistant major depressive disorder (TRD), there was no significant difference in depression scores between riluzole and placebo extension (Ibrahim et al., 2012). Riluzole also did not delay relapse in ketamine responders, which is consistent with a prior report of lack of efficacy in 14 ketamine responders (Mathew et al., 2010). However, as riluzole has been proposed to have adjunctive antidepressant effects in TRD, and, although glutamatergic, its mechanism of action is distinct from ketamine's, we hypothesized that riluzole has antidepressant effects in ketamine non‐responders. Methods: 52 TRD inpatients in a current major depressive episode of at least moderate depression severity [Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score ≥22 at screening and the day of infusion) received a single open‐label subanesthetic dose (0.5mg/kg) ketamine infusion over 40 minutes. 4‐6 hours post‐infusion, subjects were randomized double‐blind to either flexible‐dose (100‐200mg/day) riluzole or placebo twice daily for four weeks. Dose escalations were allowed on a weekly basis, and dose reductions were permitted by one capsule (50mg/week to a minimum of 100mg/day) for intolerable side effects. The MADRS is reported here as change in total score was the primary outcome measure. Responders and non‐responders were defined as ≥50% and<50% improvement, respectively, from baseline MADRS at 230 minutes (last pre‐randomization time point). Factorial linear mixed models with restricted maximum likelihood estimation and an autoregressive moving average covariance structure were used to examine change in MADRS with time as a within‐subjects factor and drug as a between‐subjects factor. MADRS score at 230 minutes was included as a covariate. All potential interactions between time and drug were included in the model. Results: At 230 minutes post‐infusion, 32 patients were non‐responders, and 16 non‐responders were randomized to each arm. There were no significant differences in demographic or neuropsychiatric characteristics (including length of illness, length of current episode and number of failed antidepressant trials) between groups. The linear mixed model showed no main effect of drug [F(1,29)=0.62, p=.44] or time [F(27,231)=1.50, p=.058]. There was also no interaction between drug and time [F(27,231)=1.15, p=.29]. This small sample size, however, may leave the study underpowered to detect a small‐to‐medium effect. In non‐responders, riluzole's maximum effect was observed at day one (d=.39) but was lost by day six. Yet, at the end of protocol, sample sizes were even smaller due to attrition ‐ placebo: 8/16 (50%) drop‐outs; riluzole: 6/16 (38%) dropouts. There was no statistically significant difference in drop‐outs between groups (p=.72), and, with the exception of one patient randomized to riluzole who discontinued due to severe nausea, the remaining drop‐outs were attributed to psychiatric indications, i.e. continued poor and/or worsening mood, anxiety or suicidal ideation. At day 28, there was only one antidepressant responder randomized to placebo (6%) and no responders randomized to riluzole (drop‐outs were counted as non‐responders). Conclusions: Although potentially underpowered to detect a small‐to‐moderate‐sized effect, riluzole is unlikely to be an effective antidepressant medication for ketamine nonresponders. There are several potential limitations, however, that may preclude broader generalization to other populations: our highly‐refractory cohort and insufficient trial duration.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"933","Resting-state Network-specific Breakdown of Functional Connectivity during Ketamine Alteration of Consciousness in Volunteers.^\nBACKGROUND: Consciousness-altering anesthetic agents disturb connectivity between brain regions composing the resting-state consciousness networks (RSNs). The default mode network (DMn), executive control network, salience network (SALn), auditory network, sensorimotor network (SMn), and visual network sustain mentation. Ketamine modifies consciousness differently from other agents, producing psychedelic dreaming and no apparent interaction with the environment. The authors used functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore ketamine-induced changes in RSNs connectivity. METHODS: Fourteen healthy volunteers received stepwise intravenous infusions of ketamine up to loss of responsiveness. Because of agitation, data from six subjects were excluded from analysis. RSNs connectivity was compared between absence of ketamine (wake state [W1]), light ketamine sedation, and ketamine-induced unresponsiveness (deep sedation [S2]). RESULTS: Increasing the depth of ketamine sedation from W1 to S2 altered DMn and SALn connectivity and suppressed the anticorrelated activity between DMn and other brain regions. During S2, DMn connectivity, particularly between the medial prefrontal cortex and the remaining network (effect size β [95% CI]: W1 = 0.20 [0.18 to 0.22]; S2 = 0.07 [0.04 to 0.09]), and DMn anticorrelated activity (e.g., right sensory cortex: W1 = -0.07 [-0.09 to -0.04]; S2 = 0.04 [0.01 to 0.06]) were broken down. SALn connectivity was nonuniformly suppressed (e.g., left parietal operculum: W1 = 0.08 [0.06 to 0.09]; S2 = 0.05 [0.02 to 0.07]). Executive control networks, auditory network, SMn, and visual network were minimally affected. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine induces specific changes in connectivity within and between RSNs. Breakdown of frontoparietal DMn connectivity and DMn anticorrelation and sensory and SMn connectivity preservation are common to ketamine and propofol-induced alterations of consciousness.","[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"2874","Imprinting: expanding the extra-pharmacological model of psychedelic drug action to incorporate delayed influences of sets and settings.^\nBACKGROUND: Psychedelic drug experiences are shaped by current-moment contextual factors, commonly categorized as internal (set) and external (setting). Potential influences of past environments, however, have received little attention. AIMS: To investigate how previous environmental stimuli shaped the experiences of patients receiving ketamine for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), and develop the concept of ""imprinting"" to account for such time-lagged effects across diverse hallucinogenic drugs. METHODS: Recordings of treatment sessions and phenomenological interviews from 26 participants of a clinical trial investigating serial intravenous ketamine infusions for TRD, conducted from January 2021 to August 2022, were retrospectively reviewed. A broad literature search was undertaken to identify potentially underrecognized examples of imprinting with both serotonergic and atypical psychedelics, as well as analogous cognitive processes and neural mechanisms. RESULTS: In naturalistic single-subject experiments of a 28-year-old female and a 34-year-old male, subjective ketamine experiences were significantly altered by varying exposures to particular forms of digital media in the days preceding treatments. Higher levels of media exposure reduced the mystical/emotional qualities of subsequent psychedelic ketamine experiences, overpowering standard intention-setting practices and altering therapeutic outcomes. Qualitative data from 24 additional patients yielded eight further spontaneous reports of past environmental exposures manifesting as visual hallucinations during ketamine experiences. We identified similar examples of imprinting with diverse psychoactive drugs in past publications, including in the first-ever report of ketamine in human subjects, as well as analogous processes known to underly dreaming. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Past environmental exposures can significantly influence the phenomenology and therapeutic outcomes of psychedelic experiences, yet are underrecognized and understudied. To facilitate future research, we propose expanding the contextual model of psychedelic drug actions to incorporate imprinting, a novel concept that may aid clinicians, patients, and researchers to better understand psychedelic drug effects.

"3099","Inhibition of return in the human 5HT2A agonist and NMDA antagonist model of psychosis.^\nPatients with schizophrenia exhibit disturbances of orienting of attention. However, findings have been inconsistent. Pharmacologic challenges with hallucinogens have been used as models for psychosis. The NMDA antagonist state (PCP, ketamine) resembles undifferentiated psychoses with positive and negative symptoms, while the 5-HT(2A) agonist state (LSD, dimethyltryptamine (DMT)) is thought to be an appropriate model for psychoses with prominent positive symptoms. The aim of this study was to investigate orienting of attention in the human NMDA antagonist and 5-HT(2A) agonist models of psychosis. A total of 15 healthy volunteers participated in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study with a low and a high dose of DMT and S-ketamine, which elicited subtle 'prepsychotic' or full-blown psychotic symptoms (low and high dose, respectively). Nine subjects completed both experimental days with the two doses of both drugs. Overall, both hallucinogens slowed down reaction times dose dependently (DMT >S-ketamine) and DMT diminished the general response facilitating (alerting) effect of spatially neutral cues. Inhibition of Return (IOR), that is, the normal reaction time disadvantage for validly cued trials with exogenous cues and long cue target intervals, was blunted after both doses of DMT and the low dose of S-ketamine. IOR reflects an automatic, inhibitory mechanism of attention, which is thought to protect the organism from redundant, distracting sensory information. In conclusion, our data suggest a deficit of IOR in both hallucinogen models of psychosis, with the effect being clearer in the serotonin model. Blunted IOR may underlie or predispose to different psychotic manifestations, but particularly to those with prominent positive symptoms.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"4141","LSD enhances the emotional response to music.^\nRATIONALE: There is renewed interest in the therapeutic potential of psychedelic drugs such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). LSD was used extensively in the 1950s and 1960s as an adjunct in psychotherapy, reportedly enhancing emotionality. Music is an effective tool to evoke and study emotion and is considered an important element in psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy; however, the hypothesis that psychedelics enhance the emotional response to music has yet to be investigated in a modern placebo-controlled study. OBJECTIVES: The present study sought to test the hypothesis that music-evoked emotions are enhanced under LSD. METHODS: Ten healthy volunteers listened to five different tracks of instrumental music during each of two study days, a placebo day followed by an LSD day, separated by 5-7 days. Subjective ratings were completed after each music track and included a visual analogue scale (VAS) and the nine-item Geneva Emotional Music Scale (GEMS-9). RESULTS: Results demonstrated that the emotional response to music is enhanced by LSD, especially the emotions ""wonder"", ""transcendence"", ""power"" and ""tenderness"". CONCLUSIONS: These findings reinforce the long-held assumption that psychedelics enhance music-evoked emotion, and provide tentative and indirect support for the notion that this effect can be harnessed in the context of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy. Further research is required to test this link directly.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"4632","The novel psychoactive phenetylamine 4-fluoroamphetamine produces a mild psychedelic state without affecting creative thinking.^\nThe phenetylamine 4‐fluoroamphetamine (4‐FA) is a so‐called novel psychoactive substance with a chemical structure that resembles that of amphetamine and MDMA [1]. Since 4‐FA users report the subjective experience to range between that induced by amphetamine and MDMA, and it is known both substances can produce an altered state of consciousness, it will be tested whether 4‐FA induces a similar state. In addition, dissociative states have been linked with increased creativity or creative thinking [2]. In light of the renewed interest in psychedelics as therapeutic tools in the treatment of psychopathologies like depression and anxiety disorders, where rigid thinking is one of the hallmarks, it is important to test whether this new compound can induce flexible thinking. A placebo‐controlled 2‐way crossover study in twelve healthy poly‐drug users was conducted to test subjective and behavioral effects of 4‐FA (100 mg). The 100 mg dose was based on a user survey amongst Dutch 4‐FA users. The majority of the users who knew which dose they ingest typically indicated it to be between 50‐150 mg [1]. Subjective effects were tested by means of the Bowdle Visual Analogue Scale, the Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale, the Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale and the Hallucinogenic Rating Scale. Convergent and divergent thinking was assessed by means of the Picture Concept test (PCT). Both subjective and objective measures have previously been shown to be sensitive to the effects of stimulants and/or psychedelic substances [3,4]. Measurements took place 1‐to‐11 hours post‐administration. 4‐FA concentrations were determined in serum up to 12 hours after administration. Findings showed that 4‐FA induced a psychedelic state which was highest 1 hour after 4‐FA administration, around 4‐FA peak serum concentrations. The 4‐FA‐induced psychedelic state decreased over time. There was no effect of 4‐FA on creative thinking. While the hypothesis that 4‐FA would induce a psychedelic state that can be categorized in between that produced by amphetamine and MDMA was confirmed, the hypothesized effect on divergent thinking could not be confirmed. Although not statistically significant, it was interesting to see that convergent thinking was increased 6 hours after intake compared to placebo, while divergent thinking performance was placebo‐like. This pattern is opposite to the previously demonstrated ayahuasca effect where two hours after intake convergent thinking was decreased by 15% compared to baseline and divergent thinking was increased by approximately 20% [4]. To confirm the absence or presence of 4‐FA effects on creative thinking, future research needs to include creative performance tests at different time points in the serum curve. In addition, creative thinking should then also be assessed in proximity with the peak of dissociative effects to test whether both are associated as suggested by previous studies linking dissociative states and creativity [3]. It is concluded that while the 4‐FA‐induced psychedelic state is mild in intensity and in between that of amphetamine and MDMA as hypothesized, more research is needed to (in) validate whether 4‐FA can change creative thinking.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"4826","Differential effects of rumination and distraction on ketamine induced modulation of resting state functional connectivity and reactivity of regions within the default-mode network.^\nDistraction and rumination are distinct response styles that determine how an individual deals with negative thoughts and feelings. Rumination is accompanied by an elevated self-focus, which is associated with increased resting state functional connectivity and decreased reactivity within the default mode network. Interestingly, the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine reduces functional connectivity in this network, while its effects on blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses during stimulus perception are not known. Ketamine might lead to a more variable processing of the external world with an attenuated self-focus by reducing the resting state connectivity. Here, we used an emotional picture-viewing task in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging to test the hypothesis that a single ketamine administration to healthy subjects increases BOLD reactivity to negative stimuli. We found a region specific increase in BOLD reactivity in the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex and not in a posterior control region after ketamine compared with placebo administration. Moreover, a linear regression revealed that the increase in BOLD reactivity was more pronounced for subjects with a low ability to apply distraction during negative experiences. Our results implicate that ketamine attenuates a potentially pathological increased self-focus during negative experiences.

"5048","Repeated intravenous infusions of ketamine: Neurocognition in patients with anxious and nonanxious treatment-resistant depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Recent studies have suggested that neurocognition is changed after repeated infusions of ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The objective of this study was to investigate whether differences existed in the neurocognitive effect of six ketamine infusions in patients with anxious and nonanxious TRD and to determine the association between baseline neurocognition and changes in symptoms after the infusions. METHOD: Patients with anxious (n = 30) and nonanxious TRD (n = 20) received six intravenous infusions of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min) over 12 days. Speed of processing (SOP), working memory (WM), verbal learning and memory (VBM), visual learning and memory (VSM) and the severity of depressive and anxious symptoms were assessed at baseline, one day after the last infusion (day 13) and two weeks after the completion of the serial infusions (day 26). A linear mixed model was used to determine whether the neurocognitive changes differed between the two groups. Pearson correlation analysis was used to determine the relationship between baseline neurocognition and the changes in the symptomatic scores. RESULTS: Patients with anxious TRD had significant increases in SOP on day 13 and day 26 (both p < 0.001), and in VBM on day 13 (p = 0.028). However, no significant increase in any neurocognitive domain was found in patients with nonanxious TRD. Faster SOP at baseline was associated with greater improvement of anxious symptoms in patients with anxious TRD, and better VSM at baseline was associated with greater improvement of depressive symptoms in patients with nonanxious TRD. LIMITATION: The major limitation of this study is the open-label design. CONCLUSION: After six ketamine infusions, neurocognitive improvement was observed in patients with anxious TRD but not in patients with nonanxious TRD.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"5071","Cognitive and subjective acute dose effects of intramuscular ketamine in healthy adults.^\nKetamine is a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist. Given the purported role of the NMDA receptor in long-term potentiation, the primary purpose of the present study was to further understand the dose-related effects of ketamine on memory. The study was also designed to provide information about the relative effects of ketamine on memory versus nonmemory effects and to more fully characterize ketamine's overall pattern and time course of effects. Single intramuscular injections of ketamine (0.2 mg/kg, 0.4 mg/kg) were administered to 18 healthy adult volunteers using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Word lists were used to evaluate episodic memory (free recall, recognition memory, source memory) and metamemory. Working memory, time estimation, psychomotor performance, and subjective effects were assessed repeatedly for 5 hours after drug administration. Ketamine selectively impaired encoding (as measured by free recall) while sparing retrieval, working memory while sparing attention, and digit symbol substitution task speed while sparing accuracy. Ketamine did not significantly impair recognition or source memory, metamemory, or time estimation. There were no hallucinations or increases in mystical experiences with ketamine. Memory measures were less sensitive to ketamine effects than subjective or psychomotor measures. Subjective effects lasted longer than memory and most psychomotor impairments. Ketamine produces selective, transient, dose- and time-related effects. In conjunction with previous studies of drugs with different mechanisms of actions, the observed selectivity of effects enhances the understanding of the pharmacological mechanisms underlying memory, attention, psychomotor performance, and subjective experience.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"5082","Neuropsychological and mood effects of ketamine in electroconvulsive therapy: a randomised controlled trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Preliminary evidence suggests that the use of ketamine during electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be neuroprotective against cognitive impairment and have synergistic antidepressant effects. This study tested whether the addition of ketamine reduced cognitive impairment and enhanced efficacy over a course of ECT, in a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. METHODS: Fifty-one depressed patients treated with ultrabrief pulse-width right unilateral ECT were randomised to receive either ketamine (0.5mg/kg) or placebo (saline) in addition to thiopentone during anaesthesia for ECT. Neuropsychological outcomes (measured before ECT, after six treatments, and after the final ECT treatment) and mood outcomes (measured before ECT, and weekly after every three ECT treatments) were measured by a rater blinded to treatment condition. RESULTS: Neuropsychological outcomes did not differ between groups. The ECT-ketamine group had a slightly greater improvement in depressive symptoms over the first week of treatment and at one-week follow up, though there was no overall difference in efficacy at the end of the ECT course. No psychomimetic effects were detected. LIMITATIONS: The study was conducted in a clinical setting, so not all aspects of ECT treatment were fully controlled. Thiopentone doses differed slightly between groups, in order to accommodate the addition of ketamine to the anaesthetic. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of ketamine did not decrease cognitive impairment in patients having ultrabrief pulse-width right unilateral ECT, but was safe and slightly improved efficacy in the first week of treatment and at one-week follow up.

"5171","The role of adipokines in the rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine.^\nWe previously found that body mass index (BMI) strongly predicted response to ketamine. Adipokines have a key role in metabolism (including BMI). They directly regulate inflammation and neuroplasticity pathways and also influence insulin sensitivity, bone metabolism and sympathetic outflow; all of these have been implicated in mood disorders. Here, we sought to examine the role of three key adipokines-adiponectin, resistin and leptin-as potential predictors of response to ketamine or as possible transducers of its therapeutic effects. Eighty treatment-resistant subjects who met DSM-IV criteria for either major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder I/II and who were currently experiencing a major depressive episode received a single ketamine infusion (0.5 mg kg(-1) for 40 min). Plasma adipokine levels were measured at three time points (pre-infusion baseline, 230 min post infusion and day 1 post infusion). Overall improvement and response were assessed using percent change from baseline on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Lower baseline levels of adiponectin significantly predicted ketamine's antidepressant efficacy, suggesting an adverse metabolic state. Because adiponectin significantly improves insulin sensitivity and has potent anti-inflammatory effects, this finding suggests that specific systemic abnormalities might predict positive response to ketamine. A ketamine-induced decrease in resistin was also observed; because resistin is a potent pro-inflammatory compound, this decrease suggests that ketamine's anti-inflammatory effects may be transduced, in part, by its impact on resistin. Overall, the findings suggest that adipokines may either predict response to ketamine or have a role in its possible therapeutic effects.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"5495","A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of adjunctive ketamine in electroconvulsive therapy: efficacy and tolerability.^\nBACKGROUND: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) remains one of the most effective tools in the psychiatric treatment armamentarium, particularly for refractory depression. Yet, there remains a subset of patients who do not respond to ECT or for whom clinically adequate seizures cannot be elicited, for whom ketamine has emerged as a putative augmentation agent. METHODS: We searched EMBASE, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, and MEDLINE from 1962 to April 2014 to identify randomized controlled trials evaluating ketamine in ECT (PROSPERO #CRD42014009035). Clinical remission, response, and change in depressive symptom scores were extracted by two independent raters. Adverse events were recorded. Drop-outs were assessed as a proxy for acceptability. Meta-analyses employed a random effects model. RESULTS: Data were synthesized from 5 RCTs, representing a total of 182 patients with major depressive episodes (n = 165 Major Depressive Disorder, n = 17 Bipolar Disorder). ECT with ketamine augmentation was not associated with higher rates of clinical remission (Risk Difference (RD) = 0.00; 95%CI = -0.08 to 0.10), response (RD = -0.01; 95%CI = -0.11 to 0.08), or improvements in depressive symptoms (SMD = 0.38; 95%CI = -0.41 to 1.17). Ketamine augmentation was associated with higher rates of confusion/disorientation/prolonged delirium (OR = 6.59, 95%CI: 1.28-33.82, NNH = 3), but not agitation, hypertension or affective switches. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of ketamine augmentation in the ECT setting suggests a lack of clinical efficacy, and an increased likelihood of confusion. Individuals for whom adequate seizures or therapeutic response cannot be obtained have not been studied using randomized controlled designs. Additional research is required to address the role of ketamine in this population.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"5917","Regulation of neural responses to emotion perception by ketamine in individuals with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder.^\nThe glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine has demonstrated antidepressant effects in individuals with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (TRD) within 24 h of a single dose. The current study utilized functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and two separate emotion perception tasks to examine the neural effects of ketamine in patients with TRD. One task used happy and neutral facial expressions; the other used sad and neutral facial expressions. Twenty patients with TRD free of concomitant antidepressant medication underwent fMRI at baseline and 24 h following administration of a single intravenous dose of ketamine (0.5 mg kg(-1)). Adequate data were available for 18 patients for each task. Twenty age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers were scanned at one time point for baseline comparison. Whole-brain, voxel-wise analyses were conducted controlling for a family-wise error rate (FWE) of P<0.05. Compared with healthy volunteers, TRD patients showed reduced neural responses to positive faces within the right caudate. Following ketamine, neural responses to positive faces were selectively increased within a similar region of right caudate. Connectivity analyses showed that greater connectivity of the right caudate during positive emotion perception was associated with improvement in depression severity following ketamine. No main effect of group was observed for the sad faces task. Our results indicate that ketamine specifically enhances neural responses to positive emotion within the right caudate in depressed individuals in a pattern that appears to reverse baseline deficits and that connectivity of this region may be important for the antidepressant effects of ketamine.","[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"6456","An Update on the Efficacy and Tolerability of Oral Ketamine for Major Depression: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.^\nBACKGROUND: Intravenous Ketamine has shown robust antidepressant efficacy although other routes of administration are currently needed. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of oral ketamine for depression. METHODS: A comprehensive search of major electronic databases from inception to April 2020 was performed. Studies of oral ketamine for depression, from case series to randomized clinical trials, were eligible. Randomized controlled trials were included in a meta-analysis, focusing on response, remission, time to effect, and side effects. RESULTS: A total of 917 articles were identified with 890 studies screened, yielding a total of 10 studies included in our systematic review.Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (N = 161, mean age 37.9 ± 9.5 years, 58.6% females) were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled analysis suggested a significant antidepressant effect of oral ketamine (SMD: -0.75; 95% CI: -1.08, -0.43; p<0.0001; I(2) = 0%) although remission rates (RR:2.77; 95% CI:0.96, 8.00; p = 0.06) and response rates (RR:2.58; 95% CI:0.94,7.08; p = 0.07) were marginal compared to placebo at the endpoint. Oral ketamine antidepressant effects seemed to take effect at the 2nd week (SMD: -0.71; 95% CI: -1.08, -0.35; p = 0.001; I(2) = 0%). There were no significant differences in the overall side-effects between oral ketamine and the placebo group (RR 1.28, 95% CI: 0.89-1.83; p = 0.19). CONCLUSION: This focused meta-analysis of oral ketamine suggests a marginal efficacy for major depressive disorder without increased risk of adverse events. Further larger sample studies are needed to confirm these preliminary findings, analyzing differential response/remission rates by affective disorder, optimal dosing strategies, and its long-term effects.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"6713","Ecstacy/MDMA attributed problems reported by novice, moderate and heavy recretional users.^\nThe recreational use of MDMA/Ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) is associated with many psychobiological problems, but there is a paucity of data on how these relate to the level of past use. Objectives: to assess the incidence of Ecstasy-attributed problems as reported by novice, moderate and heavy users. Methods: 763 unpaid volunteers took part in a WWW study of recreational drug use. This report is based on the 282 Ecstasy users from that sample, who comprised 109 novice users (1-9 occasions), 136 moderate users (10-99 occasions), and 36 heavy users (+100 occasions). Yes/no responses were automatically recorded to a series of questions covering psychobiological problems experienced when drug-free, which were attributed by the respondents to their Ecstasy use. Results: Depression, memory problems, anxiety, mood fluctuation, poor concentration, infections, tremors/twitches and weight loss, were all significantly associated with the extent of Ecstasy use. Thus memory problems attributed to Ecstasy were reported by 19% of novice users, 52% of heavy users and 73% of heavy users (chi-square 42.74, df = 2, p < 0.001); many of the other variables showed similar trends. Conclusions. The incidence of problems attributed to Ecstasy use, is directly related to the number of occasions it has been used.

"7268","Effects of dose, sex, and long-term abstention from use on toxic effects of MDMA (ecstasy) on brain serotonin neurons.^\nBackground: 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy) is a popular recreational drug that has been shown to damage brain serotonin neurons in high doses. However, effects of moderate MDMA use on serotonin neurons have not been studied, and sex differences and the long-term effects of MDMA use on serotonin neurons have not been identified. We investigated the effects of moderate and heavy MDMA use, sex differences, and long-term effects of MDMA use on serotonin neurons in different brain regions. Methods: By means of flyers posted in ""rave"" venues in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, we recruited 15 moderate MDMA users, 23 heavy MDMA users, 16 ex-MDMA users who had stopped using MDMA for more than 1 year, and 15 controls who claimed never to have used MDMA. We studied the effects of MDMA on brain serotonin neurons using 123iodine-2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl) tropane ([123I]β-CIT) - a radioligand that binds with high affinity to serotonin transporters. Density of binding (expressed as a ratio of region-of-interest binding over binding in the cerebellum) was calculated by single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT). Findings:CT). Findings: We saw significant effects of group and group by sex (p=0.041 and p=0.022, respectively) on overall [123I]β-CIT binding ratios. In heavy MDMA users, significant decreases in overall binding ratios were seen in women (p<0.01) but not men (p=0.587). In female ex-MDMA users, overall densities of serotonin transporters were significantly higher than in heavy MDMA users (p=0.004), but not higher than in controls (p=0.524). Interpretation: Our results indicate that heavy use of MDMA is associated with neurotoxic effects on serotonin neurons, that women might be more susceptible than men, and that MDMA-induced neurotoxic changes in several brain regions of female ex-MDMA users are reversible.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"8481","Ketamine for Social Anxiety Disorder: A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Crossover Trial.^\nMany patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) experience inadequate symptom relief from available treatments. Ketamine is a potent N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist with a potentially novel mechanism of action for the treatment of anxiety disorders. Therefore, we conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 18 adults with DSM-5 SAD and compared the effects between intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min) and placebo (normal saline) on social phobia symptoms. Ketamine and placebo infusions were administered in a random order with a 28-day washout period between infusions. Ratings of anxiety were assessed 3-h post-infusion and followed for 14 days. We used linear mixed models to assess the impact of ketamine and placebo on anxiety symptoms. Outcomes were blinded ratings on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) and self-reported anxiety on a visual analog scale (VAS-Anxiety). We also used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to compare the proportion of treatment responders. Based on prior studies, we defined response as a greater than 35% LSAS reduction and 50% VAS-Anxiety reduction. We found ketamine resulted in a significantly greater reduction in anxiety relative to placebo on the LSAS (Time × Treatment: F(9,115)=2.6, p=0.01) but not the VAS-Anxiety (Time × Treatment: F(10,141)=0.4, p=0.95). Participants were significantly more likely to exhibit a treatment response after ketamine infusion relative to placebo in the first 2 weeks following infusion measured on the LSAS (33.33% response ketamine vs 0% response placebo, Wilcoxon signed-rank test z=2.24, p=0.025) and VAS (88.89% response ketamine vs 52.94% response placebo, Wilcoxon signed-rank test z=2.12, p=0.034). In conclusion, this proof-of-concept trial provides initial evidence that ketamine may be effective in reducing anxiety.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"8621","High intensity dependence of auditory evoked dipole source activity indicates decreased serotonergic activity in abstinent ecstasy (MDMA) users.^\nNeurotoxic damage of central serotonergic systems has been demonstrated in numerous animal studies after exposure to methylenedioxyamphetamines (ecstasy). A high intensity dependence of auditory evoked potentials and, particularly, of the tangential N1/P2 source activity has been associated with low levels of serotonergic neurotransmission in humans. We performed an auditory evoked potentials study in 28 abstinent recreational ecstasy users and two equally sized groups of cannabis users and nonusers. The ecstasy users exhibited an increase of the amplitude of the tangential N1/P2 source activity with higher stimulus intensities; whereas, both control groups failed to exhibit this feature. These data are in line with the hypothesis that abstinent ecstasy users present with diminished central serotonergic activity. This feature of information processing is probably related to the well-recognized neurotoxic potential of ecstasy. Our data indicate that recreational ecstasy use may cause long-term alterations in the function (and possibly structure) of the human brain.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Recent research indicates that psilocybin may constitute a valid approach to treat depression and anxiety associated to life-threatening diseases. The aim of this work was to perform a systematic review with meta-analysis of clinical trials to assess the therapeutic effects and safety of psilocybin on those medical conditions. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was used to measure the effects in depression and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used to measure the effects in anxiety. For BDI, 11 effect sizes were considered (92 patients) and the intervention group was significantly favored (WMD = -4.589; 95% CI = -4.207 to -0.971; p-value = 0.002). For STAI-Trait, 11 effect sizes were considered (92 patients), being the intervention group significantly favored when compared to the control group (WMD = -5.906; 95% CI = -7.852 to -3.960; p-value ˂ 0.001). For STAI-State, 9 effect sizes were considered (41 patients) and the intervention group was significantly favored (WMD = -6.032; 95% CI = -8.900 to -3.164; p-value ˂ 0.001). The obtained results are promising and emphasize the importance of psilocybin translational research in the management of symptoms of depression and anxiety, since the compound may be effective in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety in conditions that are either resistant to conventional pharmacotherapy or for which pharmacologic treatment is not yet approved.

"9484","Replication of ketamine's antidepressant efficacy in bipolar depression: a randomized controlled add-on trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Currently, no pharmacological treatments for bipolar depression exist that exert rapid (within hours) antidepressant or antisuicidal effects. We previously reported that intravenous administration of the N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist ketamine produced rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant bipolar depression. The present study sought to replicate this finding in an independent sample. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled study, 15 subjects with DSM-IV bipolar I or II depression maintained on therapeutic levels of lithium or valproate received a single intravenous infusion of either ketamine hydrochloride (.5 mg/kg) or placebo on 2 test days 2 weeks apart. The primary outcome measure was the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, which was used to rate overall depressive symptoms at baseline; at 40, 80, 110, and 230 minutes postinfusion; and on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 10, and 14 postinfusion. RESULTS: Within 40 minutes, depressive symptoms, as well as suicidal ideation, significantly improved in subjects receiving ketamine compared with placebo (d = .89, 95% confidence interval = .61-1.16, and .98, 95% confidence interval = .64-1.33, respectively); this improvement remained significant through day 3. Seventy-nine percent of subjects responded to ketamine and 0% responded to placebo at some point during the trial. The most common side effect was dissociative symptoms, which occurred only at the 40-minute time point. CONCLUSIONS: This study replicated our previous finding that patients with bipolar depression who received a single ketamine infusion experienced a rapid and robust antidepressant response.

To the authors knowledge, this this is the first report of an OCD patient being treated with intranasal ketamine, the first treated with multiple ketamine administrations, and the first treated with intensive ERP and repeated ketamine administrations. It is of course impossible, in examination of this single case, to determine whether ketamine and intensive CBT synergized to produce clinical benefit. It is possible that the patient benefited solely from inpatient CBT. Indeed, improvements in OCD symptoms were seen after 2 weeks of CBT and before ketamine was administered. These improvements may have also resulted from the lack of pertinent obsessive-compulsive triggers on the inpatient unit. Nonetheless, there are several reasons to believe that the patient benefited from ketamine: He reported additional symptom reductions following the initiation of ketamine treatments (this may have also been due to continued CBT). Compliance with response prevention drastically improved shortly after beginning ketamine, suggesting that ketamine may augment the process of ERP for OCD, and the patient reported rapid and drastic reductions in suicidal ideation following the first week of ketamine treatments. Further examination of the concurrent use of ketamine and extinction-based ERP for OCD is warranted. Component-controlled trials will be necessary to establish if ketamine and ERP have synergistic effects on OCD symptoms.

"319","Psilocybin-assisted treatment for alcohol use disorder: a clinical perspective.^\nBackground: Hallucinogenic compounds such as psilocybin have reemerged as promising adjunctive treatments for alcohol use disorder. A recent open‐label study of psilocybin with 12 weeks of psychosocial treatment for alcohol use disorder showed a significant acute reduction in the percentage of heavy drinking days, post‐psilocybin administration for 36 weeks (Bogenschutz, 2015). Furthermore, the study showed that psilocybin‐assisted treatment was safe, feasible, and tolerable. The methods and outcomes of that study were foundational in the design of this current investigation which is an ongoing double‐blind active controlled clinical trial of psilocybin‐assisted treatment for alcohol use disorder (target enrollment, n = 180). Methods: Patients with alcohol use disorder were assigned to either receive orally administered psilocybin or diphenhydramine in two or three sessions in addition to Motivational Enhancement and Taking Action (META) therapy and therapy sessions devoted to preparation for and debriefing from the psilocybin sessions. Total treatment course was 42 weeks. Three patients who completed treatment in the trial were selected to represent the variety of experiences and outcomes observed, not as evidence of efficacy. Treatment assignment has not been un‐blinded. Results: All three patients had a reduction in heavy drinking behavior. Two of the three patients were abstinent by the end of the trial. One of the three patients declined medication after his first session. Experiences were intense and memorable in ways that were unique to each patient. Conclusions: Although we do not know if psilocybin played a role in any of the study patients' treatment, the treatment course in its entirety was a memorable experience that appeared to have a positive impact on change in drinking behavior. These outcomes provide us with valuable information about the processes through which patients may or may not benefit from this type of treatment. Summary: This study examined psilocybin as a potential adjunctive therapy for patients with alcohol use disorder. Three patients from our ongoing double‐blind activecontrolled clinical trial were selected to represent the variety of experiences and outcomes observed, not as evidence of efficacy. Although we do not know if psilocybin played a role in any of the study patients' treatment, the treatment course in its entirety was a memorable experience that appeared to have a positive impact on change in drinking behavior. These outcomes provide us with valuable information about the processes through which patients may or may not benefit from this type of treatment. This study has important implications for the future developments of treatment for alcohol use disorder as it may provide another accessible means of therapy for an incredible complex disease process.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"377","Ecstasy (MDMA)-addicted subjects show increased serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, independently from a rise of drug-induced psychotic symptoms.^\nThe recreational drug 'ecstasy' [3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)] exerts a potent action on central serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons. These neurons utilize neurotrophins for their survival and function. In order to explore MDMA effects on neurotrophins, we measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay the serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) in 'ecstasy-addicted', 'ecstasy-addicted with signs of psychosis' and 'healthy' subjects. We found that BDNF serum levels were significantly increased in both groups of 'ecstasy-addicted' as compared with 'healthy subjects', supporting the hypothesis that BDNF is involved in MDMA action. © 2010 Society for the Study of Addiction.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"717","Effects of MDMA on sociability and neural response to social threat and social reward.^\nRATIONALE: +/-3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""ecstasy"") reportedly produces unique subjective effects, including increased sociability, feelings of closeness with others, and reduced interpersonal defensiveness. Despite their apparent importance in recreational and potential psychotherapeutic use of MDMA, the defining characteristics and neurobiological mechanisms of these interpersonal effects are poorly understood. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated acute effects of MDMA on self-reported sociability and neuronal activation in response to socially threatening (angry and fearful faces) and socially rewarding (happy faces) stimuli. Assessment of social threat response focused on amygdala activation, whereas assessment of social reward focused on ventral striatum activation. Healthy volunteers (N = 9) reporting past ecstasy use completed three experimental sessions, receiving MDMA (0.75 and 1.5 mg/kg) and placebo (PBO) under double-blind conditions. During peak drug effects, participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while viewing standardized images depicting emotional facial expressions including angry, fearful, happy, and neutral expressions. They also completed standardized self-report measures of sociability. RESULTS: MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) increased self-reported sociability compared to MDMA (0.75 mg/kg) and PBO. MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) attenuated left amygdala response to angry facial expressions compared to PBO, but MDMA did not affect amygdala reactivity to fearful expressions. MDMA (0.75 mg/kg) enhanced ventral striatum response to happy expressions relative to PBO. CONCLUSIONS: These data present the first evidence that MDMA may increase sociability in humans both by diminishing responses to threatening stimuli and enhancing responses to rewarding social signals.","[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"718","Metamemory in recreational ecstasy polydrug users: What do self-reports of memory failures mean?.^\nPrevious research has found relationships between self-rated memory and ecstasy use, such that heavier users report worse function. These findings have been interpreted in terms of objective memory capacity. However, research on metamemory suggests that self-reported memory may be only weakly related to objective function, with demographics, mood, and memory-related beliefs and feelings also contributing to ratings. This study examined relationships between ecstasy/other drug use and self-reported memory, controlling for effects of demographic factors and mood. Associations between self-reported memory, memory-related beliefs and feelings, and objectively-measured cognitive function were also examined. Forty-five ecstasy polydrug, 48 cannabis polydrug, and 40 legal drug users completed a battery of neuropsychological tests and questionnaire measures of metamemory, including memory-related control beliefs, memory-related anxiety, and self-reported prospective and general/retrospective memory. The combined polydrug groups reported more general/retrospective memory failures. Covariance analysis, however, suggested that this finding was confounded by general anxiety levels. A combination of objective cognitive measures contributed to prediction of self-rated prospective memory, with demographics, mood, and memory-related anxiety also contributing to variability. However, associations between objective and self-reported memory were not strong. Self-report may not be a specific methodology with which to assess objective memory capacities in ecstasy and other drug users. © 2008 British Association for Psychopharmacology.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]"
"791","Low-dose MDMA increases responses to psychosocial stress in healthy human volunteers.^\nBackground: ±3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, “ecstasy”) is a widely used stimulant‐psychedelic hybrid drug that enhances feelings of empathy and social closeness. These prosocial effects are thought to contribute to its widespread use. Recent evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging studies in human volunteers has suggested that MDMA may act to dampen reactivity to negative social stimuli, such as social threat, rejection, and amygdala activation in response to threatening faces. In line with these findings, MDMA has recently been considered as a potential treatment for post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety disorders due to its ability to reduce reactivity to negative emotional events and build trust in the therapeutic relationship. However, the effects of low doses of MDMA on responses to an acute social stressor have not been tested. Here we examined the effects of a relatively low dose of MDMA on subjective and physiological responses to a stressful public speaking task in healthy adult volunteers. Methods: Based on evidence suggesting MDMA dampens responses to social threat, we hypothesized that the drug would reduce responses to the stressful task. Healthy adult volunteers (N = 26) were randomly assigned to receive placebo or 0.5 mg/kg MDMA under double‐blind conditions. They attended two sessions, during which they performed either a stressful public speaking task (Trier Social Stress Test) consisting of a verbal and mental arithmetic portion or a non‐stressful control task. Throughout the sessions, the participants provided subjective reports on the effects of the drug, their mood, and how stressful they found the task. Measures of salivary cortisol, heart rate, and blood pressure were obtained at regular intervals, in addition to measures of autonomic activity (high frequency heart rate variability and impedance cardiography). Results: As expected, the stress task effectively increased heart rate, blood pressure, salivary cortisol, and subjective ratings of stress in both groups. Contrary to our hypothesis, MDMA potentiated the subjective and cortisol responses to stress, and decreased participants' ratings of self‐efficacy before the task. MDMA did not increase any indices of stress on the non‐stressful control session. Conclusions: While the relatively low dose of MDMA administered here appears to reduce responses to negative social stimuli in some contexts, it did not reduce either the subjective or objective responses during this stressful public speaking task. In fact, this low dose of MDMA seems to increase some aspects of responses to acute psychosocial stress. This finding is consistent with anxiogenic effects of some stimulant drugs, but it is at odds with evidence suggesting higher doses of MDMA reduce reactivity to negative social stimuli. It is notable that only higher doses of MDMA have been shown to increase plasma oxytocin, which has been proposed as a mechanism for MDMA's prosocial effects. It remains to be determined whether higher doses of MDMA, including doses that increase oxytocin levels, do dampen stress responses.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"1437","Cognitive function of patients with treatment-resistant depression after a single low dose of ketamine infusion.^\nBACKGROUND: Clinical and animal studies have reported conflicting results regarding the effect of ketamine on cognitive function, although increasing evidence supports a rapid and sustained antidepressant effect of a subanesthetic dose of ketamine infusion for patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). However, the cognitive function before and after ketamine infusion was rarely investigated in patients with TRD. METHODS: A total of 71 adult patients with TRD were enrolled and randomized to 0.5-mg/kg ketamine, 0.2-mg/kg ketamine, or normal saline infusion groups. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale at baseline and at different time points post ketamine infusion. Cognitive function was evaluated using working memory and go/no-go tasks at baseline, Day 3, and Day 14 post ketamine infusion. RESULTS: A single low dose of ketamine infusion did not impair the cognitive function of patients with TRD. The paired t test revealed that patients with TRD receiving 0.5 mg/kg of ketamine infusion exhibited a slight improvement in sustained attention and response control measured using the go/no-go task at Day 14 post ketamine infusion. A significant association was also observed between depressive symptoms and cognitive function changes at Day 3 in the 0.5-mg/kg ketamine infusion group. DISCUSSION: A 0.5 mg/kg dose of ketamine infusion was not harmful, but slightly beneficial, for the cognitive function of patients with TRD. Additional studies are necessary to elucidate the effects of repeated ketamine infusion on cognitive function.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"1806","A Single Ketamine Infusion Combined With Motivational Enhancement Therapy for Alcohol Use Disorder: A Randomized Midazolam-Controlled Pilot Trial.^\nOBJECTIVE: Pharmacotherapy and behavioral treatments for alcohol use disorder are limited in their effectiveness, and new treatments with innovative mechanisms would be valuable. In this pilot study, the authors tested whether a single subanesthetic infusion of ketamine administered to adults with alcohol dependence and engaged in motivational enhancement therapy affects drinking outcomes. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to a 52-minute intravenous administration of ketamine (0.71 mg/kg, N=17) or the active control midazolam (0.025 mg/kg, N=23), provided during the second week of a 5-week outpatient regimen of motivational enhancement therapy. Alcohol use following the infusion was assessed with timeline followback method, with abstinence confirmed by urine ethyl glucuronide testing. A longitudinal logistic mixed-effects model was used to model daily abstinence from alcohol over the 21 days after ketamine infusion. RESULTS: Participants (N=40) were mostly middle-aged (mean age=53 years [SD=9.8]), predominantly white (70.3%), and largely employed (71.8%) and consumed an average of five drinks per day prior to entering the study. Ketamine significantly increased the likelihood of abstinence, delayed the time to relapse, and reduced the likelihood of heavy drinking days compared with midazolam. Infusions were well tolerated, with no participants removed from the study as a result of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: A single ketamine infusion was found to improve measures of drinking in persons with alcohol dependence engaged in motivational enhancement therapy. These preliminary data suggest new directions in integrated pharmacotherapy-behavioral treatments for alcohol use disorder. Further research is needed to replicate these promising results in a larger sample.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"1848","Psychological profile of abstinent recreational Ecstasy (MDMA) users and significance of concomitant cannabis use.^\nThe popular recreational drug Ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, or MDMA, and related congeners) is neurotoxic upon central serotonergic systems in animal studies. So far, the most convincing evidence for neurotoxicity-related functional deficits in humans derives from neurocognitive studies demonstrating dose-related memory problems in Ecstasy users. The aim of the current investigation was to study the relationship between the psychological profile of recreational Ecstasy users and the patterns of their drug use. Twenty-eight abstinent recreational Ecstasy users with concomitant use of cannabis only and two equally sized, matched groups of cannabis users and non-users were administered standardized self-rating scales for the assessment of psychological problems which are thought to be related to central serotonergic function. Ecstasy users had elevated scores on subscales measuring impulsiveness, anxiety, sensation seeking, somatic complaints, obsessive-compulsive behavior and psychoticism. Higher scores were associated with both heavier Ecstasy and heavier cannabis use. After controlling for cannabis use, most group differences in psychometric scores no longer achieved statistical significance. The present data are in line with other reports demonstrating a broad range of psychological problems in Ecstasy users. However, the concomitant use of other drugs, specifically cannabis, seems to be crucial in this respect. Therefore, compared with cognitive deficits, psychological problems appear to be less suitable functional indices of Ecstasy-related neurotoxic damage of central serotonergic systems in humans.

"1850","Neuronal correlates of visual and auditory alertness in the DMT and ketamine model of psychosis.^\nDeficits in attentional functions belong to the core cognitive symptoms in schizophrenic patients. Alertness is a nonselective attention component that refers to a state of general readiness that improves stimulus processing and response initiation. The main goal of the present study was to investigate cerebral correlates of alertness in the human 5HT(2A) agonist and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) antagonist model of psychosis. Fourteen healthy volunteers participated in a randomized double-blind, cross-over event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study with dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and S-ketamine. A target detection task with cued and uncued trials in both the visual and the auditory modality was used. Administration of DMT led to decreased blood oxygenation level-dependent response during performance of an alertness task, particularly in extrastriate regions during visual alerting and in temporal regions during auditory alerting. In general, the effects for the visual modality were more pronounced. In contrast, administration of S-ketamine led to increased cortical activation in the left insula and precentral gyrus in the auditory modality. The results of the present study might deliver more insight into potential differences and overlapping pathomechanisms in schizophrenia. These conclusions must remain preliminary and should be explored by further fMRI studies with schizophrenic patients performing modality-specific alertness tasks.","[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"1948","A prospective cohort study on sustained effects of low-dose ecstasy use on the brain in new ecstasy users.^\nIt is debated whether ecstasy use has neurotoxic effects on the human brain and what the effects are of a low dose of ecstasy use. We prospectively studied sustained effects (>2 weeks abstinence) of a low dose of ecstasy on the brain in ecstasy-naive volunteers using a combination of advanced MR techniques and self-report questionnaires on psychopathology as part of the NeXT (Netherlands XTC Toxicity) study. Outcomes of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI), and questionnaires on depression, impulsivity, and sensation seeking were compared in 30 subjects (12M, 21.8+/-3.1 years) in two sessions before and after first ecstasy use (1.8+/-1.3 tablets). Interval between baseline and follow-up was on average 8.1+/-6.5 months and time between last ecstasy use and follow-up was 7.7+/-4.4 weeks. Using 1H-MRS, no significant changes were observed in metabolite concentrations of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), myo-inositol (mI), and creatine (Cr), nor in ratios of NAA, Cho, and mI relative to Cr. However, ecstasy use was followed by a sustained 0.9% increase in fractional anisotropy (FA) in frontoparietal white matter, a 3.4% decrease in apparent diffusion (ADC) in the thalamus and a sustained decrease in relative regional cerebral blood volume (rrCBV) in the thalamus (-6.2%), dorsolateral frontal cortex (-4.0%), and superior parietal cortex (-3.0%) (all significant at p<0.05, paired t-tests). After correction for multiple comparisons, only the rrCBV decrease in the dorsolateral frontal cortex remained significant. We also observed increased impulsivity (+3.7% on the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale) and decreased depression (-28.0% on the Beck Depression Inventory) in novel ecstasy users, although effect sizes were limited and clinical relevance questionable. As no indications were found for structural neuronal damage with the currently used techniques, our data do not support the concern that incidental ecstasy use leads to extensive axonal damage. However, sustained decreases in rrCBV and ADC values may indicate that even low ecstasy doses can induce prolonged vasoconstriction in some brain areas, although it is not known whether this effect is permanent. Additional studies are needed to replicate these findings.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"1961","Glutamate and the neural basis of the subjective effects of ketamine: a pharmaco-magnetic resonance imaging study.^\nCONTEXT: Ketamine evokes psychosislike symptoms, and its primary action is to impair N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor neurotransmission, but it also induces secondary increases in glutamate release. OBJECTIVES: To identify the sites of action of ketamine in inducing symptoms and to determine the role of increased glutamate release using the glutamate release inhibitor lamotrigine. DESIGN: Two experiments with different participants were performed using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover, counterbalanced-order design. In the first experiment, the effect of intravenous ketamine hydrochloride on regional blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal and correlated symptoms was compared with intravenous saline placebo. In the second experiment, pretreatment with lamotrigine was compared with placebo to identify which effects of ketamine are mediated by increased glutamate release. SETTING: Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility, Manchester, England. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-three healthy, right-handed men were recruited by advertisements. INTERVENTIONS: In experiment 1, participants were given intravenous ketamine (1-minute bolus of 0.26 mg/kg, followed by a maintenance infusion of 0.25 mg/kg/h for the remainder of the session) or placebo (0.9% saline solution). In experiment 2, participants were pretreated with 300 mg of lamotrigine or placebo and then were given the same doses of ketamine as in experiment 1. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Regional BOLD signal changes during ketamine or placebo infusion and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale scores. RESULTS: Ketamine induced a rapid, focal, and unexpected decrease in ventromedial frontal cortex, including orbitofrontal cortex and subgenual cingulate, which strongly predicted its dissociative effects and increased activity in mid-posterior cingulate, thalamus, and temporal cortical regions (r = 0.90). Activations correlated with Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale psychosis scores. Lamotrigine pretreatment prevented many of the BOLD signal changes and the symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: These 2 changes may underpin 2 fundamental processes of psychosis: abnormal perceptual experiences and impaired cognitive-emotional evaluation of their significance. The results are compatible with the theory that the neural and subjective effects of ketamine involve increased glutamate release.","[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

RESULTS: Twenty-two participants were randomised to the ketamine group, and 19 to the control, with 82.5% (n = 33) completing the study. In the ketamine group, a decrease in depressive symptoms was evident at all time points, whereas in the control group a decrease was evident only 40 min post administration. The reduction in MADRS score on day 21 was 12.75 in the ketamine group versus 2.49 points with placebo (P &lt; 0.001). Six participants in the ketamine group (27.3%) achieved remission compared with none of the controls (P &lt; 0.05). The number needed to treat for remission was 3.7.

A logistic regression indicated that lifetime cannabis use disorder, but not MDMA use, was significantly associated with lifetime Major Depressive Disorder. Stratified analyses suggested that for males, neither drug use variable was associated with major depression.

"2539","Efficacy of intravenous ketamine for treatment of chronic posttraumatic stress disorder: a randomized clinical trial.^\nIMPORTANCE: Few pharmacotherapies have demonstrated sufficient efficacy in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a chronic and disabling condition. OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy and safety of a single intravenous subanesthetic dose of ketamine for the treatment of PTSD and associated depressive symptoms in patients with chronic PTSD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Proof-of-concept, randomized, double-blind, crossover trial comparing ketamine with an active placebo control, midazolam, conducted at a single site (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York). Forty-one patients with chronic PTSD related to a range of trauma exposures were recruited via advertisements. INTERVENTIONS: Intravenous infusion of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) and midazolam (0.045 mg/kg). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was change in PTSD symptom severity, measured using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised. Secondary outcome measures included the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, the Clinical Global Impression-Severity and -Improvement scales, and adverse effect measures, including the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, and the Young Mania Rating Scale. RESULTS: Ketamine infusion was associated with significant and rapid reduction in PTSD symptom severity, compared with midazolam, when assessed 24 hours after infusion (mean difference in Impact of Event Scale-Revised score, 12.7 [95% CI, 2.5-22.8]; P = .02). Greater reduction of PTSD symptoms following treatment with ketamine was evident in both crossover and first-period analyses, and remained significant after adjusting for baseline and 24-hour depressive symptom severity. Ketamine was also associated with reduction in comorbid depressive symptoms and with improvement in overall clinical presentation. Ketamine was generally well tolerated without clinically significant persistent dissociative symptoms. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study provides the first evidence for rapid reduction in symptom severity following ketamine infusion in patients with chronic PTSD. If replicated, these findings may lead to novel approaches to the pharmacologic treatment of patients with this disabling condition.

"2627","The Association Between the Negative Effects Attributed to Ecstasy Use and Measures of Cognition and Mood Among Users.^\nIn self reports, abstinent ecstasy/polydrug users claim that they experience certain ongoing affective and psychological changes including elevated anxiety, arousal, and depression. In addition, various aspects of cognition (e.g., everyday memory, reasoning, executive functioning) appear to be affected. The present paper investigated the link between these two psychological sequelae. Ninety-five ecstasy/polydrug users completed tests of reasoning, intelligence, information processing speed, executive functioning, and everyday memory. Affect was measured via a mood adjective checklist. Adverse effects attributed to ecstasy were measured via responses to adjectives reflecting changes in users since they started using the drug. In addition, indicators of sleep quality and daytime sleepiness were obtained. Users attributed a number of adverse effects to ecstasy, namely heightened irritability, depression, paranoia, and deteriorating health. Adverse effects were significantly and negatively correlated with aspects of intelligence, everyday memory, and sleep quality. Length of use of ecstasy use was positively correlated with adverse effects. While many users attribute a number of adverse affects to their use of ecstasy, it remains unclear whether these self-perceptions are a corollary of the psychopharmacological effects of the drug or reflect factors which in fact predate its use. © 2009 American Psychological Association.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]"
"3637","Direct comparison of the acute effects of lysergic acid diethylamide and psilocybin in a double-blind placebo-controlled study in healthy subjects.^\nGrowing interest has been seen in using lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin in psychiatric research and therapy. However, no modern studies have evaluated differences in subjective and autonomic effects of LSD and psilocybin or their similarities and dose equivalence. We used a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design in 28 healthy subjects (14 women, 14 men) who underwent five 25 h sessions and received placebo, LSD (100 and 200 µg), and psilocybin (15 and 30 mg). Test days were separated by at least 10 days. Outcome measures included self-rating scales for subjective effects, autonomic effects, adverse effects, effect durations, plasma levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), prolactin, cortisol, and oxytocin, and pharmacokinetics. The doses of 100 and 200 µg LSD and 30 mg psilocybin produced comparable subjective effects. The 15 mg psilocybin dose produced clearly weaker subjective effects compared with both doses of LSD and 30 mg psilocybin. The 200 µg dose of LSD induced higher ratings of ego-dissolution, impairments in control and cognition, and anxiety than the 100 µg dose. The 200 µg dose of LSD increased only ratings of ineffability significantly more than 30 mg psilocybin. LSD at both doses had clearly longer effect durations than psilocybin. Psilocybin increased blood pressure more than LSD, whereas LSD increased heart rate more than psilocybin. However, both LSD and psilocybin showed comparable cardiostimulant properties, assessed by the rate-pressure product. Both LSD and psilocybin had dose-proportional pharmacokinetics and first-order elimination. Both doses of LSD and the high dose of psilocybin produced qualitatively and quantitatively very similar subjective effects, indicating that alterations of mind that are induced by LSD and psilocybin do not differ beyond the effect duration. Any differences between LSD and psilocybin are dose-dependent rather than substance-dependent. However, LSD and psilocybin differentially increased heart rate and blood pressure. These results may assist with dose finding for future psychedelic research.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03604744.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

All three substances are used recreationally. LSD and MDMA are being investigated as medications to assist psychotherapy, and D-amphetamine is used for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. All three substances induce distinct acute subjective effects. However, differences in acute responses to these prototypical psychoactive substances have not been characterized in a controlled study. We investigated the acute autonomic, subjective, and endocrine effects of single doses of LSD (0.1 mg), MDMA (125 mg), D-amphetamine (40 mg), and placebo in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over study in 28 healthy subjects. All of the substances produced comparable increases in hemodynamic effects, body temperature, and pupil size, indicating equivalent autonomic responses at the doses used. LSD and MDMA increased heart rate more than D-amphetamine, and D-amphetamine increased blood pressure more than LSD and MDMA. LSD induced significantly higher ratings on the 5 Dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness scale and Mystical Experience Questionnaire than MDMA and D-amphetamine. LSD also produced greater subjective drug effects, ego dissolution, introversion, emotional excitation, anxiety, and inactivity than MDMA and D-amphetamine. LSD also induced greater impairments in subjective ratings of concentration, sense of time, and speed of thinking compared with MDMA and D-amphetamine. MDMA produced greater ratings of good drug effects, liking, high, and ego dissolution compared with D-amphetamine. D-Amphetamine increased ratings of activity and concentration compared with LSD. MDMA but not LSD or D-amphetamine increased plasma concentrations of oxytocin. None of the substances altered plasma concentrations of brain-derived neurotrophic factor.

Further tasks explored aspects of long-term memory, planning, attention, and perceptual processing. With respect to working memory/executive function, a highly specific pattern of impairment was observed. Impairments were seen only at the higher dose of ketamine and restricted to a subgroup of the verbal working memory tasks: While visuo-spatial working memory showed no evidence of impairment, and while simple maintenance processes during verbal working memory were also unimpaired, higher dose ketamine produced a significant impairment in the manipulation of information within working memory.

"4094","Race and ethnicity moderate the associations between lifetime psychedelic use (MDMA/ecstasy and psilocybin) and major depressive episodes.^\nBackground: Psychedelics are receiving renewed attention within Western medicine as they represent potential treatments for many difficult-to-treat mental health disorders. However, psychedelic science is limited in its focus and inclusion of racial and ethnic minorities. Hence, this study examines whether race and ethnicity moderate the associations that naturalistic 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)/ecstasy use and psilocybin use share with major depressive episodes (MDEs). Method: Data for this project are from The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2005–2019). Participants were adults aged 18 years and older (unweighted N = 596,187). This study used multivariable logistic regression to test the interaction between race and ethnicity and MDMA/ecstasy use and psilocybin use for predicting lifetime, past year, and past year severe MDEs. Results: Race and ethnicity significantly moderated the associations between MDMA/ecstasy use and psilocybin use and MDEs. For White participants, MDMA/ecstasy use and psilocybin use each were associated with lowered odds of all three MDE outcomes (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) range: 0.82–0.92). For Hispanic participants, MDMA/ecstasy use and psilocybin use each conferred lowered odds of only a past year MDE (MDMA/ecstasy aOR: 0.82; psilocybin aOR: 0.79). For Non-Hispanic Racial Minority participants, MDMA/ecstasy and psilocybin use did not confer lowered odds of any MDE outcomes. Conclusion: Race and ethnicity have an impact on the associations that psychedelics share with mental health outcomes. Future research should explore the impact of identity and discrimination on the effects of psychedelics and should explore whether these substances can serve as effective treatments for minorities when used in culturally informed contexts.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]"

"4961","Acute effects of LSD in healthy subjects and in patients during LSD-assisted psychotherapy.^\nBackground: Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is increasingly used in clinical research. The goal of this study was to characterize and compare the acute effects of LSD in healthy subjects and in patients with psychiatric disorders. Methods: We investigated the acute effects of 0.1 and 0.2 mg LSD in placebo‐controlled, double‐blind, cross‐over studies in 24 and 16 healthy subjects. Additionally, acute effects of LSD (0.1‐0.2 mg) were assessed in 8 patients with various psychiatric diagnoses treated in Swiss psychiatric practices in group settings and in 11 patients with anxiety associated with life‐threatening illness and treated alone within a placebo‐controlled clinical trial. Acute subjective effects of LSD were assessed using visual analog scales (VASs), the 5 Dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness (5D‐ASC) scale and the Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ). Results: In healthy subjects, LSD acutely and dose‐dependently enhanced ratings of feelings of openness, trust and closeness to others on the VASs. On the 5D‐ASC, LSD increased ratings on all scales compared with placebo with higher ratings of blissful state, insightfulness, and changed meaning of percepts after 0.2 mg compared with 0.1 mg. LSD (0.1‐0.2 mg) had similar effects on the 5D‐ASC and induced similar mystical‐type experiences in the MEQ in healthy subjects and patients (alone and in group settings). Conclusions: LSD has acute empathogenic effects that may be beneficial in psychotherapy. Preliminary findings indicate that LSD produced largely comparable acute alterations in consciousness and mystical‐type experiences in healthy subjects in an experimental setting and in psychiatric patients in different treatment settings.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"4968","Effects of MDMA on social cognition.^\nThere is limited data on MDMA's effects on social cognition. We investigated acute effects of MDMA (75 and 125 mg) on aspects of social cognition in healthy subjects. We also tested other psychoactive substances including methylphenidate (40 and 60 mg), LSD (0.1 and 0.2 mg), and alcohol (target blood concentration 0.4 g/L). Outcome measures included visual analog scales (VASs) for subjective effects, a face emotion recognition task (FERT), the multifaceted empathy test (MET), and a sexual arousal task (SAT). Additionally, we measured plasma concentrations of oxytocin, cortisol, and prolactin. In the VASs, MDMA increased ratings for well‐being, happy, open, closeness, trust, and extroversion [1‐3]. LSD produced similar MDMA‐like subjective effects [4]. Alcohol slightly increased ratings for happy, open, and trust while methylphenidate had no such empathogenic effects. In the MET, MDMA enhanced emotional empathy. LSD and alcohol enhanced emotional empathy similar to MDMA but only for positive stimuli. Methylphenidate had no effect. MDMA impaired recognition of sad, angry and fearful faces in the FERT [1]. Similarly, LSD impaired decoding of sad and fearful emotions. In contrast, highdose methylphenidate enhanced recognition of sad and fearful faces, while alcohol facilitated recognition of happy faces. MDMA had no effect on sexual arousal in the SAT, while methylphenidate increased ratings of sexual arousal for explicit sexual stimuli [5]. MDMA and LSD but not the dopaminergic stimulant methylphenidate increased cortisol, prolactin, and oxytocin consistent with their serotonergic action. In conclusion, MDMA and LSD exert emotional and social cognitive effects that may be useful during psychotherapy.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"4988","Use of ketamine and esketamine for depression: an overview of systematic reviews with meta-analyses.^\nPURPOSE: To summarize the evidence of efficacy and safety of the use of ketamine and esketamine for depression. METHODS: A literature search was performed in Medline, the Cochrane Library, LILACS, and CRD until November 2020. We included systematic reviews with meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials on the use of ketamine and esketamine in adult patients with depression. Two authors independently performed the study selection and data extraction. The AMSTAR-2 tool was used to appraise the quality of included reviews. RESULTS: A total of 118 records were identified, and 11 studies fully met the eligibility criteria. Compared to control, ketamine improved the clinical response at 40 min to 1 week and clinical remission at 80 min to 72 h, and esketamine improved both outcomes at 2 h to 4 weeks. Ketamine and esketamine also had a beneficial effect on the depression scales score and suicidality. For adverse events, oral ketamine did not show significant change compared to control, while intranasal esketamine showed difference for any events, such as dissociation, dizziness, hypoesthesia, and vertigo. Most reviews were classified as ""critically low quality,"" and none of them declared the source of funding of the primary studies and assessed the potential impact of risk of bias in primary studies. CONCLUSION: Ketamine and esketamine showed a significant antidepressant action within a few hours or days after administration; however, the long-term efficacy and safety are lacking. In addition, the methodological quality of the reviews was usually critically low, which may indicate the need for higher quality evidence in relation to the theme.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"5025","Does body mass index predict response to intravenous ketamine treatment in adults with major depressive and bipolar disorder? Results from the Canadian Rapid Treatment Center of Excellence.^\nBACKGROUND: Higher body mass index (BMI) has been found to predict greater antidepressant response to intravenous (IV) ketamine treatment. We evaluated the association between BMI and response to repeat-dose IV ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). METHODS: Adults (N = 230) with TRD received four infusions of IV ketamine at a community-based clinic. Changes in symptoms of depression (ie, Quick Inventory for Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report 16; QIDS-SR16), suicidal ideation (SI; ie, QIDS-SR16 SI item), anxiety (ie, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale), anhedonic severity (ie, Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale), and functioning (ie, Sheehan Disability Scale) following infusions were evaluated. Participants were stratified by BMI as normal (18.0-24.9 kg/m2; n = 72), overweight (25-29.9 kg/m2; n = 76), obese I (30-34.9 kg/m2; n = 47), or obese II (≥35.0 kg/m2; n = 35). RESULTS: Similar antidepressant effects with repeat-dose ketamine were reported between BMI groups (P = .261). In addition, categorical partial response (P = .149), response (P = .526), and remission (P = .232) rates were similar between the four BMI groups.

"5080","Ketamine as an antidepressant: investigating new methods of administration.^\nBackground: Ketamine has been shown to have marked, rapid antidepressant effects. Most controlled trials gave ketamine 0.5 mg/kg by IV infusion (40‐60 minutes). Optimal route and dosage have been minimally investigated. Methods: 15 depressed subjects participated in a double‐blind, placebo‐ controlled crossover trial. Ascending doses (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 mg/kg), with random insertion of placebo (midazolam), were given ≥ 1 week apart. Treatments were by IV (n=4), IM (n=5) or SC (n=6) injection. Mood (MADRS) and psychiatric (BPRS, CADSS) outcomes were assessed by a blinded rater: pre‐treatment, 4 hours, 24 hours, 4 days, 7 days after each treatment. A mixed effects repeated measures model (MERM) was used to examine the effects of route and dose on mood scores. Results: 8/15 subjects responded to treatment at ≤ 0.2 mg/kg. Groups did not differ in mean % MADRS change (IV 65%, IM 52%, SC 68%). For all routes, maximal response was at 24 hours. MERM analysis for doses 0.1, 0.2 mg/kg yielded main effects: route (NS), dose (p=0.038), time (linear, p=0.014; quadratic, p=0.005), and time x dose interactions (linear, p=0.057; quadratic, p=0.056). Transient mild elevations in BPRS and CADSS scores (resolving by 4 hours) were seen after ketamine but not placebo in all 3 groups and tended to be dose related. Other side effects (e.g. blood pressure increase) were most marked in the IV group. Conclusions: The SC route resulted in similar efficacy and milder side effects than the IV route.

"5173","Brain-derived neurotrophic factor and initial antidepressant response to an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist.^\nOBJECTIVE: A model has been proposed to explain the pathophysiology of mood disorders based on decreased neurotrophin levels during mood episodes; treatment with antidepressants and mood stabilizers is associated with clinical improvement. This study investigated whether changes in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels are associated with the initial antidepressant effects of ketamine, a high-affinity N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist. METHOD: Twenty-three subjects aged 18 to 65 years with DSM-IV major depressive disorder (treatment resistant) participated in this study, which was conducted between October 2006 and May 2008. The subjects were given an open-label intravenous infusion of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) and rated using various depression scales at baseline and at 40, 80, 120, and 230 minutes postinfusion. The primary outcome measure was the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score. BDNF levels were obtained at the same time points as depression rating scale scores. RESULTS: Despite a significant (P <. 001) improvement in MADRS scores after subjects received ketamine treatment, no changes in BDNF levels were observed in subjects after they received ketamine compared to baseline. Also, no association was found between antidepressant response and BDNF levels. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that ketamine's rapid initial antidepressant effects are not mediated by BDNF. Further studies are necessary to shed light on the neurobiological basis of these effects.

"5618","Predictive value of heart rate in treatment of major depression with ketamine in two controlled trials.^\nOBJECTIVE: Ketamine has been shown to be effective in treatment of episodes of major depressive disorder (MDD). This controlled study aimed to analyse the predictive and discriminative power of heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) for ketamine treatment in MDD. METHODS: In 51 patients, HR and HRV were assessed at baseline before and during ketamine infusion and 24 hours post ketamine infusion. Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was used to assess changes of depressive symptoms. A 30% or 50% reduction of symptoms after 24 hours or within 7 days was defined as response. A linear mixed model was used for analysis. RESULTS: Ketamine infusion increased HR and HRV power during and after infusion. Responders to ketamine showed a higher HR during the whole course of investigation, including at baseline with medium effect sizes (Cohen's d = 0.47-0.67). Furthermore, HR and HRV power discriminated between responders and non-responders, while normalized low and high frequencies did not. CONCLUSION: The findings show a predictive value of HR and HRV power for ketamine treatment. This further underlines the importance of the autonomous nervous system (ANS) and its possible malfunctions in MDD. SIGNIFICANCE: The predictive power of HR and HRV markers should be studied in prospective studies. Neurophysiological markers could improve treatment for MDD via optimizing the choice of treatments.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"5717","Functional MRI study of working memory in MDMA users.^\nRATIONALE: Methylene-dioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is known to cause degeneration of serotonin nerve terminals after acute doses in animals. Similarly, behavioral studies in human MDMA users regularly find abnormalities in memory, mood, and impulse control. However, studies of brain function using brain imaging in MDMA users have been less consistent. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), whether individuals with a self-reported history of MDMA use would differ from non-MDMA using controls on activation while performing a working memory task. METHODS: Fifteen MDMA using subjects and 19 non-MDMA using controls underwent fMRI scanning while performing the immediate and delayed memory task (IMT/DMT). The study was based on a block design in which the delayed memory task (DMT) alternated with the immediate memory task (IMT), which served as a control condition. FMRI scans were acquired on a 1.5 T scanner, using a gradient echo echoplanar pulse sequence. RESULTS: Random effects SPM99 analysis showed significantly greater activation (whole volume corrected cluster P<0.05) during the DMT relative to the IMT in the MDMA subjects compared with the control subjects in the medial superior frontal gyrus, in the thalamus extending into putamen, and in the hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: Although these effects could be due to other drugs used by MDMA users, these results are consistent with behavioral problems that are associated with MDMA use, and with animal studies on the effects of MDMA on brain function.","[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"5926","Broadband cortical desynchronization underlies the human psychedelic state.^\nPsychedelic drugs produce profound changes in consciousness, but the underlying neurobiological mechanisms for this remain unclear. Spontaneous and induced oscillatory activity was recorded in healthy human participants with magnetoencephalography after intravenous infusion of psilocybin-prodrug of the nonselective serotonin 2A receptor agonist and classic psychedelic psilocin. Psilocybin reduced spontaneous cortical oscillatory power from 1 to 50 Hz in posterior association cortices, and from 8 to 100 Hz in frontal association cortices. Large decreases in oscillatory power were seen in areas of the default-mode network. Independent component analysis was used to identify a number of resting-state networks, and activity in these was similarly decreased after psilocybin. Psilocybin had no effect on low-level visually induced and motor-induced gamma-band oscillations, suggesting that some basic elements of oscillatory brain activity are relatively preserved during the psychedelic experience. Dynamic causal modeling revealed that posterior cingulate cortex desynchronization can be explained by increased excitability of deep-layer pyramidal neurons, which are known to be rich in 5-HT2A receptors. These findings suggest that the subjective effects of psychedelics result from a desynchronization of ongoing oscillatory rhythms in the cortex, likely triggered by 5-HT2A receptor-mediated excitation of deep pyramidal cells. © 2013 the authors.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Use of buprenorphine follow standard of care, and the investigators are investigating the additive power of adjunctive psilocybin to enhance opioid abstinence, treatment adherence, quality of life, and mood. The study will consist of a brief (6‐8 day) inpatient phase for standard buprenorphine induction as well as experimental psilocybin administration, an 8‐week outpatient phase involving standard buprenorphine maintenance and experimental follow‐up meetings, and long‐term follow‐up sessions for 4 months after. During the inpatient phase, participants will be inducted onto sublingual (SL) buprenorphine (using a buprenorphine/naloxone combination product) while admitted to the Bayview Clinical Research Unit. During this time, participants will also undergo 2‐3 preparatory sessions, and will undergo an experimental drug administration session under supportive conditions, during which the participants will receive either a very low dose (1 mg) or a single high (30mg) oral dose of psilocybin under double‐blind conditions.

A randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial demonstrated the safety and efficacy of MDMA-assisted therapy (MDMA-AT) for the treatment of severe PTSD. This analysis explores patterns of alcohol and substance use in patients receiving MDMA-AT compared to placebo plus therapy (Placebo+Therapy). METHODS: Adult participants with severe PTSD (n = 90) were randomized to three blinded trauma-focused therapy sessions with either MDMA-AT or Placebo+Therapy. Eligible participants met DSM-5 criteria for severe PTSD and could meet criteria for mild (current) or moderate (early remission) alcohol or cannabis use disorder; other SUDs were excluded. The current analyses examined outcomes on standardized measures of hazardous alcohol (i.e., Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test; AUDIT) and drug (i.e., Drug Use Disorder Identification Test; DUDIT) use at baseline prior to randomization and at study termination. RESULTS: There were no treatment group differences in AUDIT or DUDIT scores at baseline. Compared to Placebo+therapy, MDMA-AT was associated with a significantly greater reduction in mean (SD) AUDIT change scores (Δ = -1.02 (3.52) as compared to placebo (Δ = 0.40 (2.70), F (80, 1) = 4.20, p = 0.0436; Hedge's g= .45). Changes in DUDIT scores were not significantly different between treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: MDMA-AT for severe PTSD may also lead to subclinical improvements in alcohol use.

METHODS: Twenty-six patients with treatment-resistant depression were assessed using the suicidality item of the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-SI) 2 hours before and 24 hours following a single subanesthetic dose of intravenous ketamine. Ten patients also completed IATs assessing implicit suicidal associations at comparable time points. In a second study, nine patients received thrice-weekly ketamine infusions over a 12-day period. RESULTS: Twenty-four hours after a single infusion, MADRS-SI scores were reduced on average by 2.08 points on a 0 to 6 scale (p < .001; d = 1.37), and 81% of patients received a rating of 0 or 1 postinfusion. Implicit suicidal associations were also reduced following ketamine (p = .003; d = 1.36), with reductions correlated across implicit and explicit measures.

"7126","Elevated impulsivity and impaired decision-making cognition in heavy users of MDMA (""Ecstasy"").^\nRationale: In animal studies, the common club drug 3,4- methylendioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""Ecstasy"") consistently caused a prolonged loss of presynaptic serotonergic neurons, and evidence suggests that MDMA consumption may also affect the human serotonergic system. Serotonin (5-HT) has been implicated in the regulation of impulsivity and such executive functions as decision-making cognition. In fact, MDMA users have shown elevated impulsivity in two studies, but little is known about decision making in drug-free MDMA consumers. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the cognitive neurotoxicity of MDMA with regard to behavioral impulsivity and decision-making cognition. Methods: Nineteen male, abstinent, heavy MDMA users; 19 male, abstinent cannabis users; and 19 male, drug-naïve controls were examined with the Matching Familiar Figures Test (MFFT) as well as with a Go/No-Go Task (GNG) for impulsivity and with a Gambling Task (GT) for executive functioning. Results: MDMA users showed significantly elevated impulsivity in the MFFT Impulsivity score (I-score), but not in commission errors of the GNG, compared with controls. Cannabis users did not yield altered impulsivity compared with controls. In the GT, MDMA users performed significantly worse than cannabis consumers and controls, whereas cannabis users exhibited the same decision-making capacity as controls. In addition, the I-score as well as the decision-making performance was correlated with measures of MDMA intake. The I-score and the decision-making performance were also correlated. Conclusions: These results suggest that heavy use of MDMA may elevate behavioral impulsivity and impair decision-making cognition possibly mediated by a selective impairment of the 5-HT system. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Because these regions play a role in verbal memory, we hypothesized that MDMA users would show altered brain activation in these areas during performance of a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task that probed semantic verbal memory. Polysubstance users enriched for MDMA exposure participated in a semantic memory encoding and recognition fMRI task that activated left BA 9, 18, 21/22 and 45. Primary outcomes were percent blood oxygen level-dependent signal change in left BA 9, 18, 21/22 and 45, accuracy and response time. During semantic recognition, lifetime MDMA use was associated with decreased activation in left BA 9, 18 and 21/22 but not 45. This was partly influenced by contributions from cannabis and cocaine use. MDMA exposure was not associated with accuracy or response time during the semantic recognition task. During semantic recognition, MDMA exposure was associated with reduced regional brain activation in regions mediating verbal memory. These findings partially overlap with previous structural evidence for reduced grey matter in MDMA users and may, in part, explain the consistent verbal memory impairments observed in other studies of MDMA users.","[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Little is known about ecstasy effects later in life, when serotonin levels and cognition decrease as a consequence of normal ageing. Objective: This study aimed to assess whether harmful effects of ecstasy only add to or also interact with age-related neuropsychological decline. Methods: Attention, verbal and visual memory, visuospatial ability, self-reported depression, sensation-seeking and impulsivity were assessed in middle-aged moderate to heavy ecstasy/polydrug users (n=17) and compared with none or very mild ecstasy using polydrug users (matched for age, gender, intelligence and other drugs; n=16) and a group of drug-naive controls (n=20). Results: Moderate to heavy ecstasy/polydrug users performed significantly worse on a verbal memory task than none or very mild ecstasy using polydrug users and drug naives. Moderate and heavy ecstasy/polydrug users also differed significantly from drug-naives on measures of depression, sensation-seeking and impulsivity but not from none or very mild ecstasy-using polydrug users. Conclusion: This study in middle-aged ecstasy/polydrug users replicated findings of studies in younger ecstasy users, showing a harmful effect of ecstasy on verbal memory.

An 18-FDG PET study.^\nThe aim of this study was to determine the acute effects of the ""Ecstasy"" analogue MDE (3,4-methylene dioxyethamphetamine) on cerebral glucose metabolism (rMRGlu) of healthy volunteers and to correlate neurometabolism with acute psychopathology. In a randomized double-blind trial, 15 healthy volunteers without a history of drug abuse were examined with fluorine-18-deoxyglucose (18FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) 110-120 min after oral administration of 2 mg/kg MDE (n = 7) or placebo (n = 8). Two minutes prior to radiotracer injection, constant cognitive stimulation was started and maintained for 32 min using a word repetition paradigm to ensure constant and comparable mental conditions during cerebral glucose uptake. Individual brain anatomy was represented using Tl-weighted 3D flash magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), followed by manual regionalization into 108 regions of interest and PET/MRI overlay. After absolute quantification of rMRGlu and normalization to global metabolism, normalized rMRGlu under MDE was compared to placebo using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Acute psychopathology was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and rMRGlu was correlated to PANSS scores according to Spearman. MDE subjects showed significantly decreased rMRGlu in the bilateral frontal cortex: left frontal posterior (-7.1%, P < 0.05) and right prefrontal superior (-4.6%, P < 0.05).

There were positive correlations between rMRGlu in the middle right cingulate and grandiosity (r = 0.87, P < 0.05), both the right amygdala (r = 0.90, P < 0.01) and the left posterior cingulate (r = 0.90, P < 0.01) to difficulties in abstract thinking, and the right frontal inferior (r = 0.85, P < 0.05), right anterior cingulate (r = 0.93, P < 0.01), and left anterior cingulate (r = 0.85, P < 0.05) to attentional deficits. A negative correlation was found between the left frontal operculum (Broca's area) and attentional deficits (r = -0.85, P < 0.05).

"7914","Effects of cannabis use on antidepressant treatment response to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and ketamine.^\nThe present letter presents a retrospective analysis of Veterans treated with these modalities at the VA San Diego Medical Center between 2017 and 2023 and analyzed whether cannabis moderated the antidepressant effects. We found a group difference only in age for the rTMS and ketamine groups (cannabis users were on average younger (p < 0.05)). We next examined whether cannabis use affected changes in PHQ-9 scores during ketamine treatments, revealing a main effect of treatment (F (4, 510) = 21.6, p < 0.0001), with a mean reduction of 4.4 points on the PHQ-9 (CI 2.7–6.1). There was no main effect of cannabis use (F (1, 118) = 0.58, p = 0.45) nor a significant group x time interaction (F (7, 759) = 0.36, p = 0.93). Non-cannabis users showed a 4.5 point reduction (CI 2.539–6.407) while cannabis users showed a 4.3 point reduction (CI 0.7802–7.917). Our study limitations include a modest sample, a unique population of Veterans that may not generalize, and a non-randomized uncontrolled analysis. Our study strengths include results that generalize across two treatments (ketamine and rTMS), and a naturalistic design without obvious bias. Finally, this is currently the largest data on the effects of cannabis on treatment outcomes of ketamine and rTMS.

"8219","Body mass index (BMI) does not predict responses to psilocybin.^\nBackground: Psilocybin is a serotonin type 2A (5-HT2A) receptor agonist and naturally occurring psychedelic. 5-HT2A receptor density is known to be associated with body mass index (BMI), however, the impact of this on psilocybin therapy has not been explored. While body weight-adjusted dosing is widely used, this imposes a practical and financial strain on the scalability of psychedelic therapy. This gap between evidence and practice is caused by the absence of studies clarifying the relationship between BMI, the acute psychedelic experience and long-term psychological outcomes. Method: Data were pooled across three studies using a fixed 25 mg dose of psilocybin delivered in a therapeutic context to assess whether BMI predicts characteristics of the acute experience and changes in well-being 2 weeks later. Supplementing frequentist analysis with Bayes Factors has enabled for conclusions to be drawn regarding the null hypothesis. Results: Results support the null hypothesis that BMI does not predict overall intensity of the altered state, mystical experiences, perceptual changes or emotional breakthroughs during the acute experience. There was weak evidence for greater ‘dread of ego dissolution’ in participants with lower BMI, however, further analysis suggested BMI did not meaningfully add to the combination of the other covariates (age, sex and study). While mystical-type experiences and emotional breakthroughs were strong predictors of improvements in well-being, BMI was not. Conclusions: These findings have important implications for our understanding of pharmacological and extra-pharmacological contributors to psychedelic-assisted therapy and for the standardization of a fixed therapeutic dose in psychedelic-assisted therapy.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"8295","Ketamine-induced disruption of verbal self-monitoring linked to superior temporal activation.^\nINTRODUCTION: Misattribution of distorted self-generated speech in patients with schizophrenia has been associated with increased lateral temporal activation. As a pharmacological model of schizophrenia, we tested whether ketamine would induce the same effects in healthy individuals. METHODS: Participants were 8 healthy male volunteers who were naïve to ketamine (mean age: 28 years). Ketamine (0.23 mg/kg bolus followed by 0.64 mg/kg/h) and placebo infusions were administered in a double-blind, randomised order, during 2 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sessions. Each fMRI session consisted of a verbal self-monitoring task in which auditory feedback was experimentally modified. RESULTS: Ketamine was associated with psychotic and dissociative symptoms. Participants made more misattributions of distorted self-generated speech (P < 0.02) during the ketamine infusion. Ketamine led to reduced activation in the left superior temporal cortex during self-distorted speech, regardless of whether the speech was identified correctly or not, as compared to the placebo infusion. Misidentification of speech that had been distorted was not associated with any increase in brain activation in during the placebo infusion, however ketamine-induced misattributions were associated with a relative increase in left superior temporal cortex activation. DISCUSSION: These data are consistent with the notion that self-monitoring impairments underlie psychotic symptoms and suggest that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor dysfunction may mediate self-monitoring deficits and psychotic phenomena in schizophrenia.","[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"8400","Cancer at the dinner table: Experiences of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of cancer-related distress.^\nRecent randomized controlled trials of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for patients with cancer suggest that this treatment results in large-magnitude reductions in anxiety and depression as well as improvements in attitudes toward disease progression and death, quality of life, and spirituality. To better understand these findings, we sought to identify psychological mechanisms of action using qualitative methods to study patient experiences in psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 13 adult participants with clinically elevated anxiety associated with a cancer diagnosis who received a single dose of psilocybin under close clinical supervision. Transcribed interviews were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis, which resulted in 10 themes, focused specifically on cancer, death and dying, and healing narratives. Participants spoke to the anxiety and trauma related to cancer, and perceived lack of available emotional support. Participants described the immersive and distressing effects of the psilocybin session, which led to reconciliations with death, an acknowledgment of cancer’s place in life, and emotional uncoupling from cancer. Participants made spiritual or religious interpretations of their experience, and the psilocybin therapy helped facilitate a felt reconnection to life, a reclaiming of presence, and greater confidence in the face of cancer recurrence. Implications for theory and clinical treatment are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"8749","Change in patient-centered outcomes of psychological well-being, sleep, and suicidality following treatment with intravenous ketamine for late-life treatment-resistant depression.^\nOBJECTIVE: To examine whether psychological well-being, sleep, and suicidality improved with treatment with intravenous (IV) ketamine for late-life treatment-resistant depression (TRD). METHODS: This is an analysis of secondary outcomes in an open-label late-life TRD study examining the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of IV ketamine infusions. In the acute phase, participants (N = 25) aged 60 years or older received twice-a-week IV ketamine for 4 weeks. Then, participants with Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score <10 or ≥ 30% reduction from baseline proceeded to the continuation phase, an additional four weeks of once-a-week IV ketamine. The secondary outcomes analyzed here are based on the National Institute of Health Toolbox Psychological Well-Being subscales for Positive Affect and General Life Satisfaction, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and the Scale for Suicidal Ideation. RESULTS: Psychological well-being, sleep, and suicidality improved during the acute phase and those improvements were sustained during the continuation phase. Greater improvements in measures of psychological well-being and sleep were seen in participants who had greater improvements in MADRS scores and moved onto the continuation phase. All but one of the few participants with high suicidality at baseline improved; there were no cases of treatment-emergent suicidality. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological well-being, sleep, and suicidality improved in participants with late-life TRD who received IV ketamine for 8 weeks. A future larger and longer controlled trial is needed to confirm and extend these findings. REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04504175.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"8777","Association of intranasal esketamine, a novel 'standard of care' treatment and outcomes in the management of patients with treatment-resistant depression: protocol of a prospective cohort observational study of naturalistic clinical practice.^\nINTRODUCTION: Esketamine is the S-enantiomer of racemic ketamine and has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the management of treatment resistant depression, demonstrating effective and long-lasting benefits. The objective of this observational study is to elucidate the association of intranasal (IN) esketamine with beneficial and negative outcomes in the management of treatment resistant major depressive disorder. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multicentre prospective cohort observational study of naturalistic clinical practice. We expect to recruit 10 patients per research centre (6 centres, total 60 subjects). After approval to receive IN esketamine as part of their standard of care management of moderate to severe treatment resistant depression, patients will be invited to participate in this study. Association of esketamine treatment with outcomes in the management of depression will be assessed by measuring the severity of depression symptoms using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and tolerability by systematically tracking common side effects of ketamine treatment, dissociation using the simplified 6-Item Clinician Administered Dissociative Symptom Scale and potential for abuse using the Likeability and Craving Questionnaire (LCQ). Change in depressive symptoms (MADRS total scores) over time will be evaluated by within-subject repeated measures analysis of variance. We will calculate the relative risk associated with the beneficial (reduction in total scores for depression) outcomes, and the side effect and dropout rates (tolerability) of adding IN esketamine to patients' current pharmacological treatments. Covariate analysis will assess the impact of site and demographic variables on treatment outcomes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Approval to perform this study was obtained through the Health Sciences Research Ethics Board at Queen's University. Findings will be shared among collaborators, through departmental meetings, presented on different academic venues and publishing our manuscript.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"8798","Is ketamine an appropriate alternative to ECT for patients with treatment resistant depression? A systematic review.^\nOBJECTIVE: Ketamine has repeatedly shown to have rapid and robust antidepressant effects in patients with treatment resistant depression (TRD). An important question is whether ketamine is as effective and safe as the current gold standard electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). METHODS: The literature was searched for trials comparing ketamine treatment with ECT for depression in the Pubmed/MEDLINE database and Cochrane Trials Library. RESULTS: A total of 137 manuscripts were identified, 6 articles were included in this review. Overall quality of the included studies was diverse with relevant risk of bias for some of the studies. Results suggest that ketamine treatment might give faster but perhaps less durable antidepressant effects. Side effects differed from ECT, in particular less cognitive impairment was apparent in ketamine treatment. LIMITATIONS: The included studies have limited sample sizes, use different treatment protocols and in most trials, longer term follow up is lacking. Furthermore, allocation bias appears likely in the non-randomized trials. CONCLUSIONS: Current available literature does not yet provide convincing evidence to consider ketamine as an equally effective treatment alternative to ECT in patients with TRD. There are indications for a more favourable short term cognitive side effect profile after ketamine treatment. Methodologically well-designed studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow up duration are warranted.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"8913","5-HT modulation of dopamine release in basal ganglia in psilocybin-induced psychosis in man--a PET study with [11C]raclopride.^\nThe modulating effects of serotonin on dopamine neurotransmission are not well understood, particularly in acute psychotic states. Positron emission tomography was used to examine the effect of psilocybin on the in vivo binding of [11C]raclopride to D2-dopamine receptors in the striatum in healthy volunteers after placebo and a psychotomimetic dose of psilocybin (n = 7). Psilocybin is a potent indoleamine hallucinogen and a mixed 5-HT2A and 5-HT1A receptor agonist. Psilocybin administration (0.25 mg/kg p.o.) produced changes in mood, disturbances in thinking, illusions, elementary and complex visual hallucinations and impaired ego-functioning. Psilocybin significantly decreased [11C]raclopride receptor binding potential (BP) bilaterally in the caudate nucleus (19%) and putamen (20%) consistent with an increase in endogenous dopamine. Changes in [11C]raclopride BP in the ventral striatum correlated with depersonalization associated with euphoria. Together with previous reports of 5-HT receptor involvement in striatal dopamine release, it is concluded that stimulation of both 5-HT2A and 5-HT1A receptors may be important for the modulation of striatal dopamine release in acute psychoses. The present results indirectly support the hypothesis of a serotonin-dopamine dysbalance in schizophrenia and suggest that psilocybin is a valuable tool in the analysis of serotonin-dopamine interactions in acute psychotic states.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"9071","Influence of low-dose esketamine on postoperative depressive symptoms in patients with breast cancer (EASE): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.^\nIntroduction Depressive symptoms have surfaced as the principal mental health concern among patients with breast cancer, with surgical interventions potentially exacerbating these symptoms and adversely influencing clinical outcomes. This study protocol is designed to investigate the efficacy of low‐dose esketamine administered perioperatively on depressive symptoms in patients with breast cancer. It also aims to illuminate the potential neurobiological underpinnings of this effect. Methods and analysis This research represents a single‐centre, prospective, randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study. The trial anticipates enrolling 108 female patients exhibiting mild‐to‐severe depressive symptoms who are slated for radical mastectomy. Through stratified randomisation, eligible patients will be systematically assigned to either the esketamine group (0.25 mg/kg) or placebo group (0.9% saline) in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome is the response rate at the third postoperative day. Secondary outcomes encompass the remission rate, depression‐related scores, depression severity and safety‐related endpoints. Tertiary (exploratory) outcomes involve alterations in brain‐derived neurotrophic factor and resting‐state functional brain connectivity. Ethics and dissemination The Clinical Trial Ethics Committee at The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University has conferred ethical approvals for this trial (approval number: PJ2023‐05‐25). Results from this trial will be disseminated in peer‐reviewed journals and presented at professional symposiums.

"9119","A systematic review of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy for mental health: An evaluation of the current wave of research and suggestions for the future.^\nResearch on psychedelics has seen a recent revival, with many clinical trials focused on their therapeutic potential to treat a range of mental health conditions. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate clinical trials of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy for mental health conditions from the present wave of psychedelic research (1990s to present). A total of 43 studies met criteria and were included. The conditions reviewed were substance use disorders; anxiety and/or depression, often associated with terminal illness; posttraumatic stress disorder; and obsessive–compulsive disorder. Quantitative results indicate that psychedelics can significantly reduce clinical outcomes associated with these mental health conditions. Common themes identified from qualitative reports included increased acceptance and processing of emotions, connectedness to others, forgiveness, self-compassion, insights into the self, peak or mystical experiences, ego dissolution, positive changes in worldview, motivation and commitment to change, changes in the relationship to the substance of abuse for those with substance use disorder, and acceptance of death for those with terminal illness. No serious, long-term adverse events were reported directly attributable to drug ingestion. We discuss the strengths and limitations of the research base, along with suggestions for clinical practice, potential therapeutic mechanisms, and directions for future research. Despite promising results, further work is needed to determine which psychedelic is best suited for diverse mental health conditions, the most appropriate type of psychotherapy to employ, and the psychological and neurobiological mechanisms underlying clinical benefits.

Methods: In 2 long-term, phase 3 studies (NCT02493868, October 1, 2015-February 16, 2018; NCT02497287, September 30, 2015-October 28, 2017), patients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (per DSM-5) and nonresponse to ≥ 2 oral antidepressants received esketamine nasal spray (56 or 84 mg) twice weekly during a 4-week induction phase, weekly for weeks 5-8, and weekly or every 2 weeks thereafter as maintenance treatment, in conjunction with a new oral antidepressant. A post hoc analysis using descriptive statistics evaluated occurrence (incidence, frequency, severity) and recurrence (incidence and severity) of events of specific interest. Results: In patients treated with esketamine nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant (n = 928), spontaneously reported adverse events of dizziness, nausea, sedation, vertigo, and increased blood pressure were more likely to recur after the first week of treatment if they occurred more frequently (twice > once > none) during the first week. The same pattern was observed when these events were assessed by structured instruments. Incidences of dizziness, dissociation, increased blood pressure, nausea, vertigo, and sedation were highest in week 1 of treatment (20.6%, 16.7%, 4.3%, 14.0%, 12.1%, and 3.8%, respectively) and decreased thereafter. Initial occurrences and subsequent recurrences of events were mostly mild or moderate in severity. Conclusions: Adverse events during treatment with esketamine nasal spray plus an oral antidepressant generally become less frequent with ongoing treatment, and the majority are mild or moderate in severity.

However, there is mixed evidence regarding how use of such substances outside of medical settings relates to psychological distress, depression, and suicidality. Methods: We examined data from a US representative sample of noninstitutionalized adults from the 2015–2020 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (N = 241,675). We evaluated whether past-year use of specific hallucinogens (i.e., LSD, DMT/AMT/Foxy, salvia divinorum, ecstasy [MDMA/Molly], ketamine) is associated with reporting past-year serious psychological distress (SPD), major depressive episode (MDE), and suicidality. Generalized linear models using Poisson and log link were used to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs), controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and past-year use of various other illegal drugs. Results: LSD use was associated with an increased likelihood of MDE (aPR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.10–1.37) and suicidal thinking (aPR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.09–1.34). Similar associations were observed between salvia divinorum use and suicidal thinking (aPR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.00–1.97) and between DMT/AMT/Foxy use and suicidal planning (aPR = 1.81 95% CI: 1.17–2.81).

"9381","Intraoperative ketamine for reduction in postpartum depressive symptoms after cesarean delivery: A double-blind, randomized clinical trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common mental disease happens in perinatal period. Ketamine as an anesthesia and analgesia drug has been used for a long time. In recent years, ketamine is proved to have an antidepression effect with a single administration. We hypothesized that intraoperative ketamine can reduce postpartum depressive symptoms after cesarean delivery. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study trail, healthy women scheduled for cesarean delivery were randomly assigned to receive intravenous ketamine (0.25 mg/kg diluted to 5 ml with 0.9% saline) or placebo (5 ml of 0.9% saline) within 5 min following clamping of the neonatal umbilical cord. The primary outcome was the degree of postpartum depressive symptoms, which was evaluated by Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS, a threshold of 9/10 was used) at 1 week, 2 weeks, and 1 month after delivery. The secondary outcome was the numerical rating scale (NRS) score of pain at 2 days postpartum. This trail is registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, number ChiCTR1900022464. RESULTS: Between 26 January 2019 and 15 July 2019, 502 subjects were screened and 330 were randomly allocated: 165 (50%) to the ketamine group and 165 (50%) to the placebo group. There were significant differences in the degree of postpartum depressive symptoms between subjects in the ketamine group and the placebo group at 1 week postpartum (13.1% vs. 22.6%, respectively; p = .029). However, no difference was found between subjects in the two groups at 2 weeks (11.8% vs. 16.8%, respectively; p = .209) and 1 month postpartum (10.5% vs. 14.2%, respectively; p = .319). The NRS score of wound pain (3.0 ± 0.9 vs. 4.0 ± 1.0, respectively; p < .001) and uterine contraction pain (3.0 ± 0.9 vs. 4.1 ± 0.9, respectively; p < .001) was lower in the ketamine group at 2 days postpartum compared with placebo group. The prevalence of headache, hallucination, and dizziness was higher in the ketamine group than the placebo group during the operation. CONCLUSIONS: Operative intravenous ketamine (0.25 mg/kg) can reduce the postpartum depressive symptoms for 1 week.

"9446","Sex differences in 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy)-induced cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibition in humans.^\nBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy) is a ring-substituted amphetamine widely used for recreational purposes. MDMA is predominantly O-demethylenated in humans by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 and is also a potent mechanism-based inhibitor of the enzyme. This study assessed the inhibition and recovery half-life of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 activity in female subjects by administering the probe drug dextromethorphan before and repeatedly after MDMA administration. These data were compared with the data obtained from a previous study in male subjects. STUDY DESIGN: Twelve healthy female subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers participated as outpatients in two experimental sessions. Session 1 was conducted over 2 days and session 2 over 10 days, with a minimum of 3 days between sessions. In session 1, subjects received a single oral dose of dextromethorphan 30 mg. In session 2, a 1.5 mg/kg MDMA dose was given at 0 hours, followed at 4 hours by repeated 30 mg doses of dextromethorphan over the next 10 days. METHODS: Plasma concentration-time profiles and urinary recoveries of dextromethorphan and its metabolites dextrorphan (DOR), 3-methoxymorphinan (MM) and hydroxymorphinan-3-ol (HM) were measured. RESULTS: MDMA given prior to dextromethorphan resulted in a 10-fold increase in the dextromethorphan maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), with corresponding decreases in DOR and HM pharmacokinetic parameters. The mean ± SD C(max) of MDMA was 188.8 ± 16.7 ng/mL, with a time to reach C(max) (t(max)) of 2.0 ± 0.4 hours and an AUC from 0 to 25 hours of 2645.2 ± 170.9 mg · h/mL. The urinary recovery of the dextromethorphan dose as dextromethorphan and its main metabolites was 25.4 ± 8.9% with no MDMA pretreatment versus 6.6 ± 1.1% after 1.5 mg/kg of MDMA (p = 0.0001). The metabolic ratio (MR) increased almost 60-fold from 0.018 ± 0.028 to 0.998 ± 0.932 after MDMA administration, with 100% of the subjects having a value greater than the antimode of 0.3 that signified the poor-metabolizer phenotype. Data analysis of results obtained in the present study compared with those from a previous study in male subjects showed significant differences in the dextromethorphan/DOR MR in the 0- to 8-hour (session 1) and 4- to 12-hour (session 2, post MDMA) collection periods (p = 0.032 and p = 0.01, respectively). CYP2D6 activity recovered after 10 days to 90% of baseline activity, with a recovery half-life of 36.6 ± 22.9 hours. Male subjects showed a shorter recovery half-life (27.6 ± 25.1 hours). The measurement of CYP3A4 activity indicated a non-significant increase in C(max) and AUC values of MM after drug intake, but urinary data reflected significant differences in dextromethorphan/MM MR in both sexes, although the difference was more pronounced in women. Dextromethorphan/MM MR increased almost 3-fold from baseline. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In women the pretreatment with MDMA resulted in a decrease in dextromethorphan clearance. CYP2D6 activity recovered after 10 days to 90% of baseline activity. Regarding CYP3A4 activity, there is an apparent decrease in its activity after MDMA use. In women, MDMA use has been associated with psychiatric symptoms and psychological problems that may require psychopharmacological treatment with antidepressant drugs, some of which are known CYP2D6 substrates. MDMA-induced mechanism-based inhibition of CYP2D6 is of relevance, and physicians should be advised to prescribe medications whose metabolic disposition is not regulated by CYP2D6.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"9496","S -ketamine compared to etomidate during electroconvulsive therapy in major depression.^\nObjective of the study was to compare two commonly used anesthetic drugs, S-ketamine and etomidate, regarding their influence on seizure characteristics, safety aspects, and outcome of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in major depression. Treatment data of 60 patients who underwent a total number of 13 ECTs (median) because of the severe or treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (DSM-IV) were analyzed. Etomidate, mean dosage (SD) = 0.25 (0.04) mg/kg, was used for anesthesia in 29 participants; 31 patients received S-ketamine, mean dosage (SD) = 0.96 (0.26) mg/kg. Right unilateral brief pulse ECTs were performed. The number of ECTs was individually adjusted to clinical needs, mean (SD) = 13.0 (4.3). Seizure characteristics, adverse events, and the clinical global impression (CGI) scores were compared between the both groups during ECT series. In the S-ketamine group, a lower initial seizure threshold (p = 0.014), stimulation charge (p < 0.001), higher postictal suppression (p < 0.001), EEG ictal amplitude (p = 0.04), EEG coherence (p < 0.001) and maximum heart rate (p = 0.015) were measured. Etomidate was associated with more frequent abortive seizures (p = 0.02) and restimulations (p = 0.01). The CGI scores, the number of sessions within an ECT series, and the incidence of adverse events did not differ between groups. Due to its lower initial seizure threshold, S-ketamine might hold a potential to become a clinically favorable anesthetic agent during ECT. However, the current findings should be interpreted with caution, and further prospective randomized clinical trials are required. Also, specific adverse effects profile of S-ketamine, especially with regard to the cardiovascular risk, needs to be taken into account.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"9578","Changes in synaptic markers after administration of ketamine or psychedelics: a systematic scoping review.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine and psychedelics have abuse liability. They can also induce ""transformative experiences"" where individuals experience enhanced states of awareness. This enhanced awareness can lead to changes in preexisting behavioral patterns which could be beneficial in the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs). Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that ketamine and psychedelics may alter markers associated with synaptic density, and that these changes may underlie effects such as sensitization, conditioned place preference, drug self-administration, and verbal memory performance. In this scoping review, we examined studies that measured synaptic markers in animals and humans after exposure to ketamine and/or psychedelics. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted following PRISMA guidelines, through PubMed, EBSCO, Scopus, and Web of Science, based on a published protocol (Open Science Framework, DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/43FQ9). Both in vivo and in vitro studies were included. Studies on the following synaptic markers were included: dendritic structural changes, PSD-95, synapsin-1, synaptophysin-1, synaptotagmin-1, and SV2A. RESULTS: Eighty-four studies were included in the final analyses. Seventy-one studies examined synaptic markers following ketamine treatment, nine examined psychedelics, and four examined both. Psychedelics included psilocybin/psilocin, lysergic acid diethylamide, N,N-dimethyltryptamine, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine, and ibogaine/noribogaine. Mixed findings regarding synaptic changes in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) have been reported when ketamine was administered in a single dose under basal conditions. Similar mixed findings were seen under basal conditions in studies that used repeated administration of ketamine. However, studies that examined animals during stressful conditions found that a single dose of ketamine counteracted stress-related reductions in synaptic markers in the hippocampus and PFC. Repeated administration of ketamine also counteracted stress effects in the hippocampus. Psychedelics generally increased synaptic markers, but results were more consistently positive for certain agents. CONCLUSION: Ketamine and psychedelics can increase synaptic markers under certain conditions. Heterogeneous findings may relate to methodological differences, agents administered (or different formulations of the same agent), sex, and type of markers. Future studies could address seemingly mixed results by using meta-analytical approaches or study designs that more fully consider individual differences.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
