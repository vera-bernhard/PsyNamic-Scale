"3820","Effect of baseline anxious depression on initial and sustained antidepressant response to ketamine.^\nOBJECTIVE: Patients with anxious depression are typically more difficult to treat with monoaminergic antidepressants compared to those with nonanxious depression. Although novel research has shown that the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine has rapidly acting, relatively sustained effects in treating depression, we predicted that, consistent with the existent literature on traditional antidepressants, patients with anxious depression would have a poorer antidepressant response. METHOD: Twenty-six inpatients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD) (DSM-IV criteria) received a single infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes) from January 2006-March 2013 and were followed for 28 days. A post hoc analysis compared treatment response and relapse using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) in patients with anxious versus nonanxious depression. Anxious depression was defined as MDD plus a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale anxiety/somatization factor score ≥ 7. RESULTS: Both anxious and nonanxious depressed patients responded positively to ketamine. A linear mixed model controlling for baseline with the MADRS revealed a significant group main effect (P = .03) and group-by-time interaction (P = .01). Post hoc tests indicated that patients with anxious depression had significantly fewer depression symptoms compared to those with nonanxious depression at days 1 through 5, 9 through 12, 15 through 17, and 25, with no significant group differences in dissociative (P = .62) or psychotic (P = .41) side effects. Regarding responders, patients with anxious depression relapsed significantly later than those with nonanxious depression (median ± SE = 19.0 ± 17.9 vs 1.0 ± 0.0 days to relapse, respectively; χ² = 9.30; P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: Unexpectedly, patients with anxious depression responded better to ketamine than those with nonanxious depression, with longer time to relapse and no side effect differences. This finding gives promise for the role of novel glutamatergic medications for the treatment of those with anxious depression, a traditionally difficult-to-treat subgroup of depressed patients.

"4916","A single intravenous administration of a sub-anesthetic ketamine dose during the perioperative period of cesarean section for preventing postpartum depression: A meta-analysis.^\nThe feasibility of intravenous ketamine administration during the perioperative period of cesarean section to prevent postpartum depression (PPD) has not been determined by meta-analysis. To evaluate the efficacy, safety and dose of prophylactic ketamine in offsetting PPD, we retrieved the following databases in English or Chinese from inception to December 2020: Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, CNKI, VIP and Wanfang. A total of 10 studies (9 RCTs and 1 retrospective study) were included with 2087 cases. Meta-analysis showed that in ketamine group, the score and the prevalence of PPD within 1 week postpartum were significantly reduced, whereas PPD score after 4 weeks postpartum showed no superiority. There was no significant difference in terms of total adverse events rate, although vomiting occurred more frequently in the ketamine group. In addition, we found that ketamine efficacy emerged at 0.5 mg/kg. By meta-regression, we observed that: (1) Age and BMI are negatively associated with mood response to ketamine. (2) An analgesic pump containing ketamine for continuous 48 h postpartum administration was more efficacious than an intravenous injection of ketamine during cesarean section. Current evidence shows ketamine could be efficacious and safe in the prophylactic management of PPD in women having a cesarean section.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"5705","D-serine plasma concentration is a potential biomarker of (R,S)-ketamine antidepressant response in subjects with treatment-resistant depression.^\nRATIONALE: (R,S)-ketamine is a rapid and effective antidepressant drug that produces a response in two thirds of patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The underlying biochemical differences between a (R,S)-ketamine responder (KET-R) and non-responder (KET-NR) have not been definitively identified but may involve serine metabolism. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between baseline plasma concentrations of D-serine and its precursor L-serine and antidepressant response to (R,S)-ketamine in TRD patients. METHODS: Plasma samples were obtained from 21 TRD patients at baseline, 60 min before initiation of the (R,S)-ketamine infusion. Patients were classified as KET-Rs (n = 8) or KET-NRs (n = 13) based upon the difference in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores at baseline and 230 min after infusion, with response defined as a ≥50 % decrease in MADRS score. The plasma concentrations of D-serine and L-serine were determined using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Baseline D-serine plasma concentrations were significantly lower in KET-Rs (3.02 ± 0.21 μM) than in KET-NRs (4.68 ± 0.81 μM), p < 0.001. A significant relationship between baseline D-serine plasma concentrations and percent change in MADRS at 230 min was determined using a Pearson correlation, r = 0.77, p < 0.001, with baseline D-serine explaining 60 % of the variance in (R,S)-ketamine response. The baseline concentrations of L-serine (L-Ser) in KET-Rs were also significantly lower than those measured in KET-NRs (66.2 ± 9.6 μM vs 242.9 ± 5.6 μM, respectively; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that the baseline D-serine plasma concentrations were significantly lower in KET-Rs than in KET-NRs and suggest that this variable can be used to predict an antidepressant response following (R,S)-ketamine administration.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"8606","Anxiolytic effects of acute and maintenance ketamine, as assessed by the Fear Questionnaire subscales and the Spielberger State Anxiety Rating Scale.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine has rapid anxiolytic effects in treatment-resistant obsessive compulsive, post-traumatic stress, generalised anxiety and social anxiety disorders. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess changes following acute and maintenance ketamine therapy on the Fear Questionnaire (FQ) subscales and the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory (SSAI). METHODS: This secondary analysis used data from a mixed open-label and double-blinded placebo-controlled study. A total of 24 patients received short-term ascending subcutaneous doses of ketamine and were then eligible to enter a 3-month maintenance phase of 1 mg/kg ketamine dosed once or twice weekly. FQ and SSAI data were analysed using mixed models to identify between-dose differences and to describe trends during maintenance. RESULTS: Acute ketamine dosing showed a rapid dose-related reduction in all three FQ subscales (agoraphobia, social phobia and blood-injury phobia) and in the SSAI. A progressive decrease in pre-dose rating-scale scores was evident during the 3 months of maintenance therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine demonstrated dose-related improvements in all FQ subscales and in the SSAI. Both scales appear to be suitable tools to assess the anxiolytic effects of ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant anxiety. Furthermore, ketamine appears to have broad, dose-related anti-phobic effects. These findings raise the possibility that ketamine may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of other phobic states, such as specific phobia.","[0, 1, 0, 0]"
"9175","Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to Sustain the Antidepressant Effects of Ketamine in Treatment-Resistant Depression: A Randomized Clinical Trial.^\nINTRODUCTION: Ketamine has emerged as a rapid-acting antidepressant. While ongoing treatment can prevent relapse, concerns exist regarding long-term exposure. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a randomized trial to examine the feasibility and efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) following intravenous ketamine in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). METHODS: Subjects with TRD were recruited and treated with 6 intravenous infusions of ketamine over 3 weeks. Subjects who experienced a clinical response (≥50% improvement in depression severity) were then randomized to receiving CBT or treatment as usual (TAU) for an additional 14 weeks, using a sequential treatment model. RESULTS: Of the 42 patients who signed consent, 28 patients achieved a response and were randomized to CBT or TAU. When measured using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (primary outcome measure), the effect size at the end of the study was moderate (Cohen d = 0.65; 95% CI -0.55 to 1.82), though the group-by-time interaction effect was not significant. There was a significant group-by-time interaction as measured by the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (F = 4.58; p = 0.033), favoring a greater sustained improvement in the CBT group. This corresponded to a moderate-to-large effect size of the Cohen d = 0.71 (95% CI -0.30 to 1.70) at the end of the study (14 weeks following the last ketamine infusion). In a subset of patients (N = 20) who underwent cognitive testing using the emotional N-back assessments before and after ketamine, ketamine responders showed improvement in the accuracy of emotional N-back (t[8] = 2.33; p < 0.05) whereas nonresponders did not (t[10] <1; p ns). CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-concept study provides preliminary data indicating that CBT may sustain the antidepressant effects of ketamine in TRD. Further study and optimization of this treatment approach in well-powered clinical trials is recommended.","[0, 1, 0, 0]"

"2482","Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of low dose lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in healthy older volunteers.^\nResearch has shown that psychedelics, such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), have profound anti-inflammatory properties mediated by 5-HT(2A) receptor signaling, supporting their evaluation as a therapeutic for neuroinflammation associated with neurodegenerative disease. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of orally repeated administration of 5 μg, 10 μg, and 20 μg LSD in older healthy individuals. In the current paper, we present safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic measures that relate to safety, tolerability, and dose response. METHODS: This was a phase 1 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study. Volunteers were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 dose groups (5 μg, 10 μg, 20 μg LSD, and placebo), and received their assigned dose on six occasions (i.e., every 4 days). RESULTS: Forty-eight older healthy volunteers (mean age = 62.9 years) received placebo (n = 12), 5 μg (n = 12), 10 μg (n = 12), or 20 μg (n = 12) LSD. LSD plasma levels were undetectable for the 5 μg group and peak blood plasma levels for the 10 μg and 20 μg groups occurred at 30 min. LSD was well tolerated, and the frequency of adverse events was no higher than for placebo. Assessments of cognition, balance, and proprioception revealed no impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest safety and tolerability of orally administered 5 μg, 10 μg, and 20 μg LSD every fourth day over a 21-day period and support further clinical development of LSD for the treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD).","[0, 1, 0, 0]"
"4151","MDMA use and neurocognition: A meta-analytic review.^\nRationale: To determine the association between MDMA misuse and neurocognition using meta-analysis. Objective: Separate analyses were conducted based on two sets of inclusion/exclusion criteria. A relatively stringent set required that the subjects be matched on important moderator variables, whereas the other did not. The study participants' performance in the following neurocognitive domains was reviewed: attention/concentration, verbal and nonverbal learning and memory, psychomotor speed and executive systems functioning. Results: In the 11 studies meeting the relatively stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria for this review, MDMA use was associated with neurocognitive deficits in each domain. Similarly, in the 23 studies meeting the relatively lenient inclusion/exclusion criteria for this review, MDMA use was associated with neurocognitive deficits in each domain. Small to medium effect sizes were generally observed. A comparison of the effect sizes across the two sets of analyses did not reveal significant differences. Conclusions: The findings from this review reveal that MDMA use is associated with neurocognitive deficits. The implications of these findings are discussed. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.","[0, 0, 0, 1]"
"7368","Evidence of increased activation underlying cognitive control in ecstasy and cannabis users.^\nEvidence suggests that users of ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) have behavioural and cognitive deficits and show increased impulsivity. Impulse control impairments have been shown to be common to a number of addictive behaviours and may constitute a risk factor for drug abuse and dependence. The aim of this study was to investigate brain activation during response inhibition and performance monitoring in current recreational drug users who predominantly used ecstasy. Twenty drug users (ten female) and twenty healthy controls were scanned during performance of a response-inhibition GO/NOGO task using functional magnetic resonance imaging. No performance deficits were evident. However, the drug user group revealed elevated frontal and parietal BOLD response during successful inhibitions, and temporal, frontal, and cingulate hyperactivity during commission errors. In addition, the users showed reduced deactivation in the default-mode network during task performance. Whether contributing to or arising from drug use, these results reveal dysregulation in brain regions subserving cognitive control and default-mode processes in current recreational drug users mirroring effects previously observed for ""harder"" drugs of abuse. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","[0, 1, 0, 0]"
"7554","Ketamine augmentation rapidly improves depression scores in inpatients with treatment-resistant bipolar depression.^\nOBJECTIVE: To study the clinical effect of a single ketamine infusion, 0.5 mg/kg body weight, in bipolar depressive patients receiving mood-stabilising drugs, not improving on antidepressants. Previously, in such patients, we had found a correlation between clinical efficacy, serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor and vitamin B12 levels and a rapid improvement in neurocognitive performance. METHODS: The study included 53 patients (13 men, 40 women), aged 22-81 years, receiving ≥1 mood-stabilising medications of the first and/or second generation. Pre-infusion depression intensity on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) was 23.4 ± 4.6 points and the assumed criterion for response was a reduction of ≥50% in the HDRS score after 7 days. RESULTS: Twenty-seven subjects (51%) met a criterion for response, more frequently males (77%) than females (43%). Responders did not differ from non-responders as to age, illness onset, duration of depressive episode, type of bipolar illness, family history of psychiatric illness, personal/family history of alcoholism or using lithium, quetiapine or a combination of these mood stabilisers. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm a rapid antidepressant effect of ketamine infusion in a considerable proportion of those patients with bipolar depression receiving mood-stabilising drugs. Apart from male gender, no other clinical factors were predictors of response.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"7945","Ketamine Infusion After Suicide Attempt: new Frontiers in Treating Acute Suicidality in a “real world” Medical Setting.^\nBackground/Significance: Suicide is a devastating public health crisis with few available treatments which quickly reduce the intensity of suicidality. In controlled, outpatient research settings, ketamine rapidly reduces suicidal thoughts as early as 2‐24 hours after a single infusion in patients with high suicide risk (Price 2014) ( Murrough 2015). In this IRB approved pilot study, we investigated ketamine’s effects on suicidality in a real‐world sample of recent suicide attempters at imminent risk of suicide on a tertiary‐care Consultation‐Liaison (CL) psychiatry service. Through administration of a “pre‐treatment” prior to psychiatric hospital transfer, we hypothesized ketamine would rapidly impact suicidal ideation in patients who attempted suicide and synergistically confer enduring benefits to behavioral therapies. Methods: In an open‐label design, we recruited 16 transdiagnostic patients,18‐65 years old to receive a single dose of intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) in the acute medical setting, after CL consultation and informed consent. All were psychiatrically hospitalized post‐infusion. Baseline suicidality and depression measures [Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale, Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale, Adult Suicide Ideation Questionnaire, hopelessness (via Cognitive Triad Inventory)] were compared to 24‐hours, 5‐days, 12‐days, and 1‐ and 3‐months post‐infusion using paired t‐tests. Results: Across all measures, rapid, statistically significant decreases (p’s<.001) were observed with large to very large effect sizes (Cohen’s d’s: 1.7‐8.8) at acute timepoints (24‐hour; 5‐day). These large gains were also uniformly maintained during follow‐up, continuously out to 3‐months post‐infusion. Discussion: Ketamine rapidly and robustly reduced suicidal symptoms in an ultra‐high‐risk, heterogeneous, “real world” sample. Combined with standard care, ketamine might also synergistically enhance the durability of benefit observed following discharge, consistent with a growing literature examining ketamine as a pre‐treatment to behavioral therapies ( Dakwar 2020). In forthcoming analyses, we will compare 6‐ and 12‐month rates of suicide re‐attempt and re‐hospitalization in ketamine‐treated patients to a matched case‐control sample of suicide attempters who did not receive ketamine pre‐treatment. Conclusion/Implications: Ketamine infusion is a safe, feasible, and viable method to rapidly reduce suicidality among patients admitted to the medical hospital after suicide attempt, and could also have enduring benefits. By advancing knowledge of novel treatment methods in real‐world clinical services through completion of further studies, ketamine could become an important and novel tool in the treatment of high‐risk CL patients.

"8387","Midazolam attenuates ketamine-induced abnormal perception and thought process but not mood changes.^\nPURPOSE: To determine the effects of midazolam, 30 ngxmL(-1), on altered perception, mood, and cognition induced by ketamine. METHODS: After ketamine was administered to achieve target concentrations of 50, 100, or 150 ngxmL in 11 volunteers, perception, mood, and thought process were assessed by a visual analog scale. Mini-Mental State examination (MMSE) assessed cognition. Boluses of midazolam, 30, 14.5, and 12 microgxkg(-1), were injected every 30 min to maintain the plasma concentration at 30 ngxmL(-1), which was reached 30 min after each injection. RESULTS: Ketamine produced changes in perception about the body (P < 0.01, 0.001, and 0.0001 at 30, 60, and 90 min), surroundings (P < 0.01 and 0.0001 at 60 and 90 min), time (P < 0.002 and 0.0001 at 60 and 90 min), reality (P < 0.001 and 0.0001 at 60 and 90 min), sounds (P < 0.002 at 90 min), and meaning (P < 0.05 at 90 min). Subjects felt less energetic and clearheaded (P < 0.02 and 0.05) during ketamine, midazolam, and their co-administration. Ketamine impaired thought process (P < 0.003 and 0.0001 at 60 and 90 min). Ketamine and midazolam decreased mean total MMSE and recall scores (P < 0.001 for both). Co-administration reduced the number of subjects with perceptual (body, P < 0.01 and 0.001 at 30 and 60 min) and thought process abnormalities. Within the range of observation, co-administration did not affect the changes in mood or recall.

"8457","The subjective effects of MDMA and mCPP in moderate MDMA users.^\nThe present study is part of a research program designed to better understand the neurochemical mechanisms underlying the abuse liability of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in humans. In these studies, MDMA will be compared to prototypical dopamine (D-amphetamine) and serotonin (meta-chlorophenylpiperazine, mCPP) releasing agents on a variety of measures related to dependence. In order to determine an acceptable dose range (safe but active) of MDMA and mCPP for these studies, moderate MDMA users were administered escalating doses of MDMA (75, 110 and 145 mg/70 kg) and mCPP (17.5, 35 and 52.5 mg/70 kg). Each participant received a single dose under controlled laboratory conditions, i.e. this was a six-group design with a separate group for each dose. There were five participants tested in each group. MDMA increased blood pressure and heart rate whereas mCPP had no effect on these physiological measures. MDMA produced increases in subjective effects indicative of both stimulant (increases in POMS Elation, ARCI Amphetamine, VAS High and Stimulated scale scores) and hallucinogenic effects (increases on five of the six scales of the Hallucinogenic Rating Scale). mCPP produced similar stimulant effects (e.g. increases on POMS Elation, VAS High and Stimulated), as well as hallucinogenic effects (four of the six scales of the Hallucinogenic Rating Scale), which has not been observed in previous studies.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"8662","Mismatch negativity predicts psychotic experiences induced by NMDA receptor antagonist in healthy volunteers.^\nBACKGROUND: Previous studies indicate that mismatch negativity (MMN)-a preattentive auditory event-related potential (ERP)-depends on NMDA receptor (NMDAR) functioning. To explore if the strength of MMN generation reflects the functional condition of the NMDAR system in healthy volunteers, we analyzed correlations between MMN recorded before drug administration and subsequent responses to the NMDAR antagonist ketamine or the 5-HT2a agonist psilocybin. METHODS: In two separate studies, MMN was recorded to both frequency and duration deviants prior to administration of ketamine or psilocybin. Behavioral and subjective effects of ketamine and psilocybin were assessed with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and the OAV Scale-a rating scale developed to measure altered states of consciousness. Correlations between ERP amplitudes (MMN, N1, and P2) and drug-induced effects were calculated in each study group and compared between them. RESULTS: Smaller MMN to both pitch and duration deviants was significantly correlated to stronger effects during ketamine, but not psilocybin administration. No significant correlations were observed for N1 and P2. CONCLUSIONS: Smaller MMN indicates a NMDAR system that is more vulnerable to disruption by the NMDAR antagonist ketamine. MMN generation appears to index the functional state of NMDAR-mediated neurotransmission even in subjects who do not demonstrate any psychopathology.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"9339","Effects of Low-Dose and Very Low-Dose Ketamine among Patients with Major Depression: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.^\nBACKGROUND: Several recent trials indicate low-dose ketamine produces rapid antidepressant effects. However, uncertainty remains in several areas: dose response, consistency across patient groups, effects on suicidality, and possible biases arising from crossover trials. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted for relevant randomized trials in Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO databases up to August 2014. The primary endpoints were change in depression scale scores at days 1, 3 and 7, remission, response, suicidality, safety, and tolerability. Data were independently abstracted by 2 reviewers. Where possible, unpublished data were obtained on treatment effects in the first period of crossover trials. RESULTS: Nine trials were identified, including 201 patients (52% female, mean age 46 years). Six trials assessed low-dose ketamine (0.5 mg/kg i.v.) and 3 tested very low-dose ketamine (one trial assessed 50 mg intra-nasal spray, another assessed 0.1-0.4 mg/kg i.v., and another assessed 0.1-0.5 mg/kg i.v., intramuscular, or s.c.). At day 3, the reduction in depression severity score was less marked in the very low-dose trials (P homogeneity <.05) and among bipolar patients. In analyses excluding the second period of crossover trials, response rates at day 7 were increased with ketamine (relative risk 3.4, 95% CI 1.6-7.1, P=.001), as were remission rates (relative risk 2.6, CI 1.2-5.7, P=.02). The absolute benefits were large, with day 7 remission rates of 24% vs 6% (P=.02). Seven trials provided unpublished data on suicidality item scores, which were reduced on days 1 and 3 (both P<.01) but not day 7. CONCLUSION: Low-dose ketamine appears more effective than very low dose. There is substantial heterogeneity in clinical response, with remission among one-fifth of patients at 1 week but most others having benefits that are less durable. Larger, longer term parallel group trials are needed to determine if efficacy can be extended and to further assess safety.","[0, 0, 0, 1]"
"5679","Variation of drugs involved in acute drug toxicity presentations based on age and sex: an epidemiological approach based on European emergency departments.^\nOBJECTIVE: To analyse the relative percentage of acute recreational drug toxicity emergency department (ED) presentations involving the main drug groups according to age and sex and investigate different patterns based on sex and age strata. METHODS: We analysed all patients with acute recreational drug toxicity included by the Euro-DEN Plus dataset (22 EDs in 14 European countries) between October 2013 and December 2016 (39 months). Drugs were grouped as: opioids, cocaine, cannabis, amphetamines, gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), hallucinogens, new psychoactive substances (NPS), benzodiazepines and ketamine. Descriptive data by age and sex are presented and compared among age/sex categories and among drug families. RESULTS: Of 17,371 patients were included during the 39-month period, 17,198 (99.0%) had taken at least one of the investigated drugs (median age: 31 years; 23.9% female; ethanol co-ingestion recorded in 41.5%, unknown in 31.2%; multiple drug use in 37.9%). Opioids (in 31.4% of patients) and amphetamines (23.3%) were the most frequently involved and hallucinogens (1.9%) and ketamine (1.7%) the least. Overall, female patients were younger than males, both in the whole cohort (median age 29 vs. 32 years; p < 0.001) and in all drug groups except benzodiazepines (median age 36 vs. 36 years; p = 0.83). The relative proportion of each drug group was different at every age strata and some patterns could be clearly described: cannabis, NPS and hallucinogens were the most common in patients <20 years; amphetamines, ketamine and cocaine in the 20- to 39-year group; GHB/GBL in the 30- to 39-year group; and opioids and benzodiazepines in patients ≥40 years. Ethanol and other drug co-ingestion was more frequent at middle-ages, and multidrug co-ingestion was more common in females than males. CONCLUSION: Differences in the drugs involved in acute drug toxicity presentations according to age and sex may be relevant for developing drug-prevention and education programs for some particular subgroups of the population based on the increased risk of adverse events in specific sex and/or age strata.","[0, 0, 0, 1]"

This procedure is not in practice in Hungary at present, the aim of our work to reproduce the findigs of international studies in domestic circumstances. Matter - Major depression is a common, chronic and severe mental disorder, with 16.2% lifetime prevalence. Many international randomized, placebo controlled trials found administration of ketamine infusion effective in depressed patients. Methods - Since ketamine is an anesthetic agent, its administration was performed in the post-operative monitoring room of our hospital operating-room, supervised by an anesthesiologist. According to formerly published data, a dose of 0.5 mg/kg of body weight was administered intravenously in 40 minutes by perfusor. The drug was administered in a same manner fifteen days later. Subject - The patient was admitted to our inpatient ward with severe depression. During two months of combined antidepressant therapy her condition has not improved significantly. Approval for off label drug indication was granted with urgency by the National Institute of Quality and Organizational Development in Healthcare and Medicines. Results - During the two treatments the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 21 items rating scale score was reduced to 8 from the baseline 28, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale score was reduced to 6 from 25, Beck Depression Inventory was reduced to 9 from 20. Upon administration of the drug no severe adverse event was detected, the mild dissociative state related to ketamine was ceased in a short period of time. Discussion - With administration of 0.5 mg/kg ketamine the authors managed to achieve rapid improvement in a therapy resistant depressed patient, without permanent side effects.

Our study sought to evaluate longitudinal changes in SI and a more subtle manifestation, desire for hastened death (DHD), after psilocybin intervention in patients with cancer. Methods: This study entailed a secondary analysis of data collected in a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, crossover‐design trial of psilocybin (0.3mg/kg) versus active placebo (niacin 250mg) in conjunction with psychotherapy in participants with cancer (n=29). Of those who endorsed SI at baseline (n = 11), roughly half were randomized to the psilocybin‐first PF (n=6) versus niacin‐first NF (n=5) groups. SI was assessed by summing scores on the suicidality items on the Beck Depression Inventory‐II and the Brief Symptom Inventory. DHD was assessed by combining two items from the Demoralization Scale. Results: After the first medication session, prior to crossover, the NF group exhibited no within‐group change in SI compared to baseline. However, the PF group showed significant within‐group reduction in SI from baseline to all three pre‐crossover time points (p<0.001). Post‐crossover, at 6.5‐month follow‐up, both groups showed significant reductions in SI compared to baseline (p<0.005). We found no between‐group differences in DHD prior to the first medication session. However, the PF group endorsed significantly less DHD after the first medication session prior to crossover (p<0.01). Post‐crossover, the combined groups showed significant reductions in DHD compared to baseline at three time points (p<0.005). Conclusions: Our results support the hypothesis that a single dose of psilocybin may have rapid and persisting anti‐suicidal properties in patients with cancer.

"1687","Occipital cortical proton MRS at 4 Tesla in human moderate MDMA polydrug users.^\nThe recreational drug MDMA (3,4, methylenedioxymethamphetamine; sold under the street name of Ecstasy) is toxic to serotonergic axons in some animal models of MDMA administration. In humans, MDMA use is associated with alterations in markers of brain function that are pronounced in occipital cortex. Among neuroimaging methods, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies of brain metabolites N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and myoinositol (MI) at a field strength of 1.5 Tesla (T) reveal inconsistent results in MDMA users. Because higher field strength proton MRS has theoretical advantages over lower field strengths, we used proton MRS at 4.0 T to study absolute concentrations of occipital cortical NAA and MI in a cohort of moderate MDMA users (n = 9) versus non-MDMA using (n = 7) controls. Mean NAA in non-MDMA users was 10.47 mM (± 2.51), versus 9.83 mM (± 1.94) in MDMA users. Mean MI in non-MDMA users was 7.43 mM (± .68), versus 6.57 mM (± 1.59) in MDMA users. There were no statistical differences in absolute metabolite levels for NAA and MI in occipital cortex of MDMA users and controls. These findings are not supportive of MDMA-induced alterations in NAA or MI levels in this small sample of moderate MDMA users. Limitations to this study suggest caution in the interpretation of these results. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.","[0, 0, 0, 1]"
"1888","Characteristics of ecstasy users in Sãio Paulo, Brazil.^\nThe present study was aimed at identifying patterns of Ecstasy (methylenedioxymethamphetamine-MDMA) use in the city of São Paulo. Ecstasy users were recruited through the snowball technique. Using the same technique, a non-user control group was recruited among individuals that had never tried the drug but shared with users a similar life style. Users (N = 52) and non-users (N = 52) were interviewed in order to obtain data on socio-demographic characteristics and use of psychoactive drugs. In addition, levels of anxiety, depression and impulsiveness were assessed through Spielberger's IDATE Trace Inventory, Beck's Depression Inventory and Barrat Impulsiveness Scale. Both users and non-users revealed similar socio-demographic characteristics: most subjects were middle class young heterosexual single men and women who had a college degree. Multiple drug use was more frequent among users than among non-users. Other features that were significantly more accentuated among users than among non-users were the presence of tattoos and piercings, the frequency of attending raves and the preference for electronic music. Beck Inventory results pointed to significantly lower depression scores among users. No differences were observed between groups regarding anxiety and impulsiveness scores. Although the use of Ecstasy in São Paulo is restricted to a young middle or high social class, their vanguard lifestyle tends to influence youngsters of other social extractions, so that the use of the drug may soon become widespread and thus a legitimate public health concern.","[0, 0, 0, 1]"
"2099","A Single Dose of LSD Does Not Alter Gene Expression of the Serotonin 2A Receptor Gene (HTR2A) or Early Growth Response Genes (EGR1-3) in Healthy Subjects.^\nRationale: Renewed interest has been seen in the use of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in psychiatric research and practice. The repeated use of LSD leads to tolerance that is believed to result from serotonin (5-HT) 5-HT(2A) receptor downregulation. In rats, daily LSD administration for 4 days decreased frontal cortex 5-HT(2A) receptor binding. Additionally, a single dose of LSD acutely increased expression of the early growth response genes EGR1 and EGR2 in rat and mouse brains through 5-HT(2A) receptor stimulation. No human data on the effects of LSD on gene expression has been reported. Therefore, we investigated the effects of single-dose LSD administration on the expression of the 5-HT(2A) receptor gene (HTR2A) and EGR1-3 genes. Methods: mRNA expression levels were analyzed in whole blood as a peripheral biomarker in 15 healthy subjects before and 1.5 and 24 h after the administration of LSD (100 μg) and placebo in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Results: LSD did not alter the expression of the HTR2A or EGR1-3 genes 1.5 and 24 h after administration compared with placebo. Conclusion: No changes were observed in the gene expression of LSD's primary target receptor gene or genes that are implicated in its downstream effects. Remaining unclear is whether chronic LSD administration alters gene expression in humans.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"

LSD is well-known to induce perceptual alterations, but unknown is whether LSD alters emotional processing in ways that can support psychotherapy. We investigated the acute effects of LSD on emotional processing using the Face Emotion Recognition Task (FERT) and Multifaceted Empathy Test (MET). The effects of LSD on social behavior were tested using the Social Value Orientation (SVO) test. Two similar placebo-controlled, double-blind, random-order, crossover studies were conducted using 100 μg LSD in 24 subjects and 200 μg LSD in 16 subjects. All of the subjects were healthy and mostly hallucinogen-naive 25- to 65-year-old volunteers (20 men, 20 women). LSD produced feelings of happiness, trust, closeness to others, enhanced explicit and implicit emotional empathy on the MET, and impaired the recognition of sad and fearful faces on the FERT. LSD enhanced the participants' desire to be with other people and increased their prosocial behavior on the SVO test. These effects of LSD on emotion processing and sociality may be useful for LSD-assisted psychotherapy.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"2227","Acute neuropsychological effects of MDMA and ethanol (co-)administration in healthy volunteers.^\nRATIONALE: In Western societies, a considerable percentage of young people expose themselves to 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ""ecstasy""). Commonly, ecstasy is used in combination with other substances, in particular alcohol (ethanol). MDMA induces both arousing as well as hallucinogenic effects, whereas ethanol is a general central nervous system depressant. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study is to assess the acute effects of single and co-administration of MDMA and ethanol on executive, memory, psychomotor, visuomotor, visuospatial and attention function, as well as on subjective experience. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a four-way, double-blind, randomised, crossover, placebo-controlled study in 16 healthy volunteers (nine male, seven female) between the ages of 18-29. MDMA was given orally (100 mg) and blood alcohol concentration was maintained at 0.6 per thousand by an ethanol infusion regime. RESULTS: Co-administration of MDMA and ethanol was well tolerated and did not show greater impairment of performance compared to the single-drug conditions. Impaired memory function was consistently observed after all drug conditions, whereas impairment of psychomotor function and attention was less consistent across drug conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Co-administration of MDMA and ethanol did not exacerbate the effects of either drug alone. Although the impairment of performance by all drug conditions was relatively moderate, all induced significant impairment of cognitive function.","[0, 0, 0, 1]"

"3592","The rapid anti-suicidal ideation effect of ketamine: A systematic review.^\nIn many countries suicide rates have been trending upwards for close to twenty years-presenting a public health crisis. Most suicide attempts and deaths are associated with psychiatric illness, usually a depressive disorder. Subanesthetic ketamine is the only FDA-approved antidepressant that works in hours not weeks-thus potentially transforming treatment of suicidal patients. We reviewed all randomized controlled trials of the effect of ketamine on suicidal ideation to determine if ketamine rapidly reduces suicidal ideation [SI] in depressed patients and how long the benefit persists after one dose and if the route of administration or dose affects the outcome. A systematic review was conducted as per PRISMA [preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses] criteria. PubMed search inclusive of ""ketamine"" and ""suicide"" yielded 358 results. Papers (N = 354) were then read by at least two authors, identifying 12 meeting eligibility requirements and eleven RCTs examining whether ketamine treatment ameliorated SI. Four of five RCTs examined racemic ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) given intravenously and found an advantage for ketamine over control for rapid reduction in SI in acutely depressed patients. Two studies examined intranasal esketamine in depressed suicidal patients and found no advantage over saline. One study examined outcome six weeks after a single intravenous dose of ketamine and found benefit for SI sustained relative to 24 h post-dose. Further research is warranted into: optimal dosing strategy, including number and frequency; and long-term efficacy and safety. Ultimately, it remains to be shown that ketamine's benefit for SI translates into prevention of suicidal behavior.","[0, 0, 0, 1]"
"4049","Discriminative stimulus effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in humans trained to discriminate among d-amphetamine, meta-chlorophenylpiperazine and placebo.^\nIn animals, two-choice drug discrimination studies have demonstrated that the behavioral effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) are mediated by dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. In order to delineate the relative role of these systems, three-choice paradigms have been used in animals, with findings indicating a more prominent role for serotonin. Human studies assessing the subjective and physiological effects of MDMA have also indicated a mixed action. To parallel animal studies, the participants in the present study were trained to discriminate among a prototypic dopaminergic agonist, d-amphetamine, a prototypic serotonergic agonist, meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) and placebo and then were tested with two doses of MDMA. In addition, subjective and physiological effects were measured. The results demonstrated that humans could be trained to discriminate among 20 mg d-amphetamine, 0.75 mg/kg mCPP and placebo. When tested with 1.0 and 1.5 mg/kg, half the participants reported MDMA to be like amphetamine and half like mCPP. There were no clear differences between these two groups in other dimensions, although there was an indication that the individuals who discriminated MDMA as d-amphetamine were more sensitive to the effects of all the drugs. The subjective effects of all three drugs overlapped, although the effects of MDMA appeared more amphetamine-like.","[0, 1, 0, 0]"
"4096","MDMA/ecstasy use and psilocybin use are associated with lowered odds of psychological distress and suicidal thoughts in a sample of US adults.^\nBackground: Suicide is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and rates within the United States have risen over the past two decades. Hence, there is a critical need for novel tools to treat suicidal ideation and related mental health conditions. 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)/ecstasy and classic psychedelics may be two such tools. Aims: The aim of this study was to assess non-causal associations between MDMA/ecstasy and classic psychedelic use and psychological distress and suicide risk. Methods: In this study, we examined the aforementioned associations among 484,732 adult participants in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2008–2019). Results: Lifetime MDMA/ecstasy use was associated with reduced odds of past year suicidal thinking (10% reduced odds; odds ratio (OR) = 0.90; 95% confidence interval, CI = (0.84–0.97); p < 0.01) and past year suicidal planning (OR = 0.88; 95% CI = (0.78–0.99); p < 0.05). Furthermore, lifetime psilocybin use was associated with reduced odds of past month psychological distress (OR = 0.78; 95% CI = (0.73–0.84); p < 0.001) and past year suicidal thinking (OR = 0.90; 95% CI = (0.83–0.96); p < 0.01). Finally, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) was associated with increased odds of past year suicidal thinking (OR = 1.07; 95% CI = (1.00–1.15); p < 0.05). Conclusion: MDMA/ecstasy and psilocybin use are associated with reduced odds of suicidal thinking and related outcomes—though experimental studies are needed to determine whether these associations are causal. These findings call for more research into the efficacy of MDMA/ecstasy and classic psychedelics for treating psychological distress and suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and for updated drug legislation that allows for further investigation into these substances.","[0, 0, 0, 1]"
"4165","The Tolerability and Safety of Psilocybin in Psychiatric and Substance-Dependence Conditions: A Systematic Review.^\nOBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic review is to determine the tolerability and safety of psilocybin in a variety of psychiatric and substance-dependence conditions. DATA SOURCES: A systematic review was conducted using Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Central, and Web of Science through September 2023 using the following terminology: ""psilocybin"" AND ""mental-disease"" OR ""substance-dependence"" AND ""disease-therapy,"" in addition to other synonymous key words. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Literature reporting acute effects and safety data following the use of psilocybin as the pharmacologic intervention in a clinical trial in adult patients with a psychiatric or substance-dependence condition were included. Following the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 16 studies were ultimately included in this review. DATA SYNTHESIS: The most common treatment-emergent adverse effects reported were transient nausea and headache. Transient anxiety was reported as a frequent psychiatric effect, and 3 participants received a benzodiazepine for refractory anxiety during the psilocybin session. Psilocybin demonstrated modest increases in blood pressure and heart rate, and 1 participant received an antihypertensive for sustained hypertension during the psilocybin session. No cases of psilocybin-induced psychosis or Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder were reported. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE: Treatment resistance remains a concern for psychiatric patients and novel therapies are needed to help alleviate the burden of morbidity and mortality. Psilocybin demonstrates promising acute and long-term safety that may allow for its use in psychiatric or substance-dependence conditions as an alternative to standards of care or in treatment-resistant patients.

"4350","Persisting Effects of Ayahuasca on Empathy, Creative Thinking, Decentering, Personality, and Well-Being.^\nBackground: Naturalistic and placebo-controlled studies have suggested that ayahuasca, a traditional Amazonian beverage, could be helpful in the treatment of psychopathologies like depression and anxiety disorders by changing otherwise disturbed cognitive and emotional processes. To better understand its full therapeutic potential, one way is to study the effects on processes like flexible thinking, empathy, and well-being, which are normally compromised in stress-related psychopathologies. Materials and Methods: Volunteers attending ayahuasca ceremonies were asked to complete a test battery at three separate occasions: baseline, the morning after, and 1 week after the ceremony. We included the constructs of creative thinking (measured by Picture Concept Test), empathy (Multifaceted Empathy Test), satisfaction with life (Satisfaction with Life Scale), decentering (Experiences Questionnaire), and personality (Big Five Inventory) into the test battery. Additionally, the psychedelic experience was quantified with the Persisting Effects Questionnaire, the Ego Dissolution Scale, and Visual Analogue Scales. Results: In total, 43 attendees (males = 22; females = 21) completed parts of the baseline assessment, 20 (males = 12; females = 8) completed assessments in the morning after the ceremony, and 19 (males = 14; females = 5) completed assessments at the 1-week follow-up. At one and 7 days post-ceremony, cognitive empathy, satisfaction with life, and decentering increased, while divergent thinking (Fluency corrected for Originality) decreased, when compared to baseline. Implicit emotional empathy increased at 1-week follow-up, whereas ratings of the trait neuroticism decreased. Conclusion: The study suggests that a single ingestion of ayahuasca in a social setting is associated with enhancement of subjective well-being, an enhanced ability to take an objective and non-judging stance towards the self (decentering), and the ability to correctly recognize emotions in others, compared to baseline, lasting up to 1 week post-ceremony. To understand the therapeutic potential related to these effects, further research with clinical populations is needed in which these effects can be assessed, including its link with therapeutic outcomes. Together, this will increase our understanding of the effectiveness and breadth of future therapeutic options.","[0, 0, 0, 1]"
"4558","Ketamine psychotherapy for heroin addiction: immediate effects and two-year follow-up.^\nSeventy detoxified heroin-addicted patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups receiving ketamine psychotherapy (KPT) involving two different doses of ketamine. The patients of the experimental group received existentially oriented psychotherapy in combination with a hallucinogenic (""psychedelic"") dose of ketamine (2.0 mg/kg im). The patients of the control group received the same psychotherapy combined with a low, non-hallucinogenic (non-psychedelic), dose of ketamine (0.2 mg/kg im). Both the psychotherapist and patient were blind to the dose of ketamine. The therapy included preparation for the ketamine session, the ketamine session itself, and the post session psychotherapy aimed to help patients to integrate insights from their ketamine session into everyday life. The results of this double blind randomized clinical trial of KPT for heroin addiction showed that high dose (2.0 mg/kg) KPT elicits a full psychedelic experience in heroin addicts as assessed quantitatively by the Hallucinogen Rating Scale. On the other hand, low dose KPT (0.2 mg/kg) elicits ""sub-psychedelic"" experiences and functions as ketamine-facilitated guided imagery. High dose KPT produced a significantly greater rate of abstinence in heroin addicts within the first two years of follow-up, a greater and longer-lasting reduction in craving for heroin, as well as greater positive change in nonverbal unconscious emotional attitudes than did low dose KPT.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"

METHODS: We randomized 48 patients with TRD and SI into groups receiving a single infusion of 0.5 mg/kg ketamine or 0.045 mg/kg midazolam. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale were used to assess symptoms. Positron emission tomography (PET)-magnetic resonance imaging was conducted prior to infusion and on Day 3 postinfusion. We performed longitudinal voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis to evaluate the gray matter (GM) volume changes of the DLPFC. The standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr) of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET images was calculated using the SUV of the cerebellum as a reference region. RESULTS: The VBM analysis revealed a small but significant volumetric reduction in the right DLPFC in the ketamine group compared with that in the midazolam group. A greater reduction in depressive symptoms was associated with a smaller decrease in right DLPFC volumes (p = 0.025). However, we found no SUVr changes of the DLPFC between baseline and post-Day 3 ketamine infusion. DISCUSSION: The optimal modulation of the right DLPFC GM volumes may play an essential role in the antidepressant neuromechanisms of low-dose ketamine.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"5001","Baseline cognitive function predicts full remission of suicidal symptoms among patients with treatment-resistant depression and strong suicidal ideation after low-dose ketamine infusion.^\nBACKGROUND: Whether pretreatment working memory and response inhibition function are associated with the rapid and sustained antisuicidal effect of low-dose ketamine among patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and strong suicidal ideation is unclear. METHODS: We enrolled 65 patients with TRD, comprising 33 who received a single infusion of 0.5 mg/kg ketamine and 32 who received a placebo infusion. The participants performed working memory and go/no-go tasks prior to infusion. We assessed suicidal symptoms at baseline and on postinfusion Days 2, 3, 5, and 7. RESULTS: The full remission of suicidal symptoms persisted for 3 days after a single ketamine infusion and the ketamine-related antisuicidal effect persisted for 1 week. Lower cognitive impairment at baseline (indicated by a higher rate of correct responses on a working memory task) was associated with the rapid and sustained antisuicidal effect of low-dose ketamine in patients with TRD and strong suicidal ideation. DISCUSSION: Patients with TRD and strong suicidal ideation but low cognitive impairment may benefit the most from the antisuicidal effect of low-dose ketamine.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"6003","Randomized Placebo-controlled Study of MDMA-assisted Psychotherapy in People With PTSD - Israel.^\nPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) occurs after experiencing a traumatic event or events. PTSD is a public health problem that causes a great deal of suffering. This study will examine whether two six to eight‐hour long sessions of 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)‐assisted psychotherapy scheduled three to five weeks apart are safe, and whether combining a fully therapeutic dose of MDMA with psychotherapy, compared with a low (""active placebo"") dose of MDMA, will reduce PTSD symptoms, with symptoms measured four times, twice during the study, and during two follow‐up assessments six and twelve months after the second experimental session. People who received the active placebo dose of MDMA can then take part in an ""open label"" study continuation, with the participant receiving a fully active dose of MDMA on two more six to eight hour‐long psychotherapy sessions. Open‐label means that the participants and the researchers know that the participant will receive the fully active dose of MDMA. People who receive the full dose of MDMA, and anyone who received low‐dose MDMA and does not undergo the open‐label study continuation will have PTSD symptoms measured six and twelve months after the second fully active or low dose MDMA session. People who take part in the open label study continuation have their PTSD symptoms checked six and 12 months after the second open label MDMA‐assisted session. MDMA is a substance that has unique effects that make it well suited to intensive psychotherapy. MDMA may belong to a new class of drugs, called entactogens, that produce feelings of closeness to others, empathy, well being, and insightfulness. Currently, MDMA is scheduled in the US and Israel, and doctors and therapists cannot give it to people outside of research studies like this one. Anecdotal reports of therapy conducted before MDMA was made illegal suggest that MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy may benefit people with PTSD, and there is an ongoing placebo‐controlled study of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy in people with crime or war‐related PTSD occurring in the US. This study will look at MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy in 12 individuals aged 18 years or older diagnosed with PTSD that arose out of war or terrorism‐related trauma, with PTSD symptoms not improving after trying at least one treatment. Eight of 12 participants will be assigned to receive the full dose of MDMA, and four will be assigned to receive a low or ""active placebo"" dose of MDMA during each of two experimental sessions. People will be assigned to full or low‐dose MDMA ""by chance,"" as by flipping a coin. The fully active dose consists of an initial dose of 125 mg MDMA and a supplemental dose of 62.5 mg given 2 to 2.5 hours later. The active placebo dose consists of an initial dose of 25 mg MDMA and a supplemental dose of 12.5 mg. The study will last approximately four months, and will include two sixty minute long introductory psychotherapy sessions, two active placebo or fully active dose MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy sessions, a sixty to ninety minute long psychotherapy session 24 hours after each experimental session, and one to two hour‐long psychotherapy sessions occurring weekly between the first and second experimental session, and between the second experimental session and the end of the study. PTSD symptoms will be measured at the start of the study and eight weeks (two months) after the second experimental session. PTSD symptoms are assessed six and twelve months after the second experimental session in people who do not take part in the open‐label study continuation. People who take part in the open‐label study continuation will have their PTSD symptoms measured six and twelve months after the second MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy session.","[0, 1, 0, 0]"
"6986","A systematic study of microdosing psychedelics.^\nThe phenomenon of 'microdosing', that is, regular ingestion of very small quantities of psychedelic substances, has seen a rapid explosion of popularity in recent years. Individuals who microdose report minimal acute effects from these substances yet claim a range of long-term general health and wellbeing benefits. There have been no published empirical studies of microdosing and the current legal and bureaucratic climate makes direct empirical investigation of the effects of psychedelics difficult. In Study One we conducted a systematic, observational investigation of individuals who microdose. We tracked the experiences of 98 microdosing participants, who provided daily ratings of psychological functioning over a six week period. 63 of these additionally completed a battery of psychometric measures tapping mood, attention, wellbeing, mystical experiences, personality, creativity, and sense of agency, at baseline and at completion of the study. Analyses of daily ratings revealed a general increase in reported psychological functioning across all measures on dosing days but limited evidence of residual effects on following days. Analyses of pre and post study measures revealed reductions in reported levels of depression and stress; lower levels of distractibility; increased absorption; and increased neuroticism. To better understand these findings, in Study Two we investigated pre-existing beliefs and expectations about the effects of microdosing in a sample of 263 naïve and experienced microdosers, so as to gauge expectancy bias. All participants believed that microdosing would have large and wide-ranging benefits in contrast to the limited outcomes reported by actual microdosers. Notably, the effects believed most likely to change were unrelated to the observed pattern of reported outcomes. The current results suggest that dose controlled empirical research on the impacts of microdosing on mental health and attentional capabilities are needed.","[1, 1, 0, 0]"
"7035","A Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)-Guided Dashboard to Review Psilocybin Target Domains: A Systematic Review.^\nBACKGROUND: Preliminary results from randomized controlled studies as well as identified molecular, cellular, and circuit targets of select psychedelics (e.g., psilocybin) suggest that their effects are transdiagnostic. In this review, we exploit the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) transdiagnostic framework, to synthesize extant literature on psilocybin. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify RDoC-based effects of psilocybin and vistas for future mechanistic and interventional research. METHODS: A systematic search in electronic databases (i.e., PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Web of Science) performed in January and February 2021 identified English articles published between 1990 and 2020 reporting the effects of psilocybin on mental health measures. Data from included articles were retrieved and organized according to the RDoC bio-behavioral matrix and its constituent six main domains, namely: positive valence systems, negative valence systems, cognitive systems, social processes, sensorimotor systems, and arousal and regulatory systems. RESULTS: The preponderance of research with psilocybin has differentially reported beneficial effects on positive valence systems, negative valence system, and social process domains. The data from the included studies support both short-term (23 assessments) and long-term (15 assessments) beneficial effects of psilocybin on the positive valence systems. While 12 of the extracted outcome measures suggest that psilocybin use is associated with increases in the ""fear"" construct of the negative valence systems domain, 19 findings show no significant effects on this construct, and seven parameters show lowered levels of the ""sustained threat"" construct in the long term. Thirty-four outcome measures revealed short-term alterations in the social systems' construct namely, ""perception and understanding of self,"" and ""social communications"" as well as enhancements in ""perception and understanding of others"" and ""affiliation and attachment"". The majority of findings related to the cognitive systems' domain reported dyscognitive effects. There have been relatively few studies reporting outcomes of psilocybin on the remaining RDoC domains. Moreover, seven of the included studies suggest the transdiagnostic effects of psilocybin. The dashboard characterization of RDoC outcomes with psilocybin suggests beneficial effects in the measures of reward, threat, and arousal, as well as general social systems. CONCLUSIONS: Psilocybin possesses a multi-domain effectiveness. The field would benefit from highly rigorous proof-of-mechanism research to assess the effects of psilocybin using the RDoC framework. The combined effect of psilocybin with psychosocial interventions with RDoC-based outcomes is a priority therapeutic vista.","[0, 0, 0, 1]"
"7073","Effects of intravenous ketamine on explicit and implicit suicdal cognition: a randomized controlled trial in treatment-resistant depression.^\nBackground: Preliminary evidence suggests intravenous (IV) ketamine has rapid effects on suicidal cognition, making it a potentially attractive candidate for depressed patients at imminent risk of suicide. In the first randomized controlled trial of ketamine to use a psychoactive control condition, we tested ketamine's acute effects on explicit suicidal cognition as well as on a performancebased index of implicit suicidal cognition (the Implicit Association Test; IAT) previously linked to suicidal behavior. Methods: Symptomatic patients with treatment‐resistant depression, defined as inadequate response to ≥ 3 antidepressants, were assessed using a composite index of explicit suicidal ideation (Beck Suicide Scale, Montgomery‐Asberg Rating Scale suicide item, Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms‐Self Report suicide item) and the IAT to assess implicit suicidal associations. Measures were taken at baseline and 24‐hours following a single subanesthetic dose of IV ketamine (n=37) or a psychoactive control with no known antidepressant properties (midazolam; n=21). Results: 24‐hours post‐infusion, explicit suicidal cognition was significantly reduced in the ketamine but not the midazolam group (group x time: p=.01). 51% of ketamine‐treated patients scored zero on all three explicit suicide measures at 24‐hours, compared with 24% of the midazolam group (Pearson's chi‐square p=.04). Implicit associations between self‐ and escape‐related words were also reduced following ketamine (p=.002; d=.51) but not midazolam (p=.65; d=.13). Conclusions: Intravenous ketamine produces rapid reductions in suicidal cognition over and above active placebo. Further study is warranted to explore whether ketamine's anti‐suicidal properties extend to higher‐risk samples and suicidal behaviors.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"8119","Maintenance ketamine treatment for depression: a systematic review of efficacy, safety, and tolerability.^\nKetamine has rapid yet often transient antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. Different strategies have been proposed to prolong these effects. Maintenance ketamine treatment appears promising, but little is known about its efficacy, safety, and tolerability in depression. We searched Pubmed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library and identified three randomised controlled trials, eight open-label trials, and 30 case series and reports on maintenance ketamine treatment. We found intravenous, intranasal, oral, and possibly intramuscular and subcutaneous maintenance ketamine treatment to be effective in sustaining antidepressant effect in treatment-resistant depression. Tachyphylaxis, cognitive impairment, addiction, and serious renal and urinary problems seem uncommon. Despite the methodological limitations, we conclude that from a clinical view, maintenance ketamine treatment seems to be of therapeutic potential. We recommend both controlled and naturalistic studies with long-term follow-up and sufficient power to determine the position of maintenance ketamine treatment within routine clinical practice.","[0, 0, 0, 1]"

Objective: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, incomplete-crossover study investigated effects of single oral administration of TAK-063 on ketamine-induced changes in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal in healthy males. Methods: Healthy men aged 18 to 45 years with normal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and electroencephalogram measurements at screening were eligible. Each subject was randomized to one of nine treatment schedules: all subjects received placebo and two of three doses of TAK-063 followed by ketamine. The primary endpoint was ketamine-induced brain activity in select regions of the brain during resting state. Secondary endpoints included pharmacokinetic parameters of TAK-063, proportion of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), and percentage of subjects meeting criteria for abnormal safety laboratory tests and vital sign measurements. Results: The study comprised 27 subjects. Prior to ketamine infusion, TAK-063 exerted region-specific effects on resting state functional MRI (fMRI) BOLD signal. After ketamine administration, TAK-063 reduced the Cohen’s effect size for resting-state fMRI BOLD signal in key brain regions examined, and exerted similar effects on BOLD signal during the working memory task across all doses. TAK-063 was safe and well tolerated. Conclusions: Our results are consistent with non-clinical studies of ketamine and TAK-063 and clinical studies of ketamine and risperidone. It is unknown whether these data are predictive of potential antipsychotic efficacy, and further analyses are required. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)","[0, 0, 0, 1]"
"120","Can 'floating' predict treatment response to ketamine? Data from three randomized trials of individuals with treatment-resistant depression.^\nKetamine has rapid-acting antidepressant properties but also potentially concerning transient dissociative side effects (SEs). Recent studies noted a positive correlation between treatment response to ketamine and general dissociative SEs, as well as ""floating"", a depersonalization SE (a subtype of the dissociative SEs). This analysis sought to determine whether floating mediates treatment response to ketamine. Data were pooled from three double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled ketamine clinical trials across which 82 participants with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) (44 with bipolar depression and 38 with major depressive disorder) received placebo and ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) infusions. SEs were actively solicited in a standardized fashion before and after ketamine infusion. The hypothesis that a post-infusion experience of floating would mediate antidepressant response to ketamine was assessed at 230 min post-infusion and at Day 1. Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score was the dependent variable in a linear mixed effects model. Ketamine significantly decreased MADRS scores (p < 0.0001), but no relationship was detected between floating and MADRS score at either 230 min or Day 1 post-infusion. The hypothesized mediation effect of floating was also not detected at either 230 min or Day 1 post-infusion. Taken together, the findings do not support the hypothesis that ketamine's antidepressant effects are mediated by the dissociative depersonalization subtype SE of floating.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"170","Evidence of neurotoxicity of ecstasy: Sustained effects on electroencephalographic activity in polydrug users.^\nObjective: According to previous EEG reports of indicative disturbances in Alpha and Beta activities, a systematic search for distinct EEG abnormalities in a broader population of Ecstasy users may especially corroborate the presumed specific neurotoxicity of Ecstasy in humans. Methods: 105 poly-drug consumers with former Ecstasy use and 41 persons with comparable drug history without Ecstasy use, and 11 drug naives were investigated for EEG features. Conventional EEG derivations of 19 electrodes according to the 10-20-system were conducted. Besides standard EEG bands, quantitative EEG analyses of 1-Hz-subdivided power ranges of Alpha, Theta and Beta bands have been considered. Results: Ecstasy users with medium and high cumulative Ecstasy doses revealed an increase in Theta and lower Alpha activities, significant increases in Beta activities, and a reduction of background activity. Ecstasy users with low cumulative Ecstasy doses showed a significant Alpha activity at 11 Hz. Interestingly, the spectral power of low frequencies in medium and high Ecstasy users was already significantly increased in the early phase of EEG recording. Statistical analyses suggested the main effect of Ecstasy to EEG results. Conclusions: Our data from a major sample of Ecstasy users support previous data revealing alterations of EEG frequency spectrum due rather to neurotoxic effects of Ecstasy on serotonergic systems in more detail. Accordingly, our data may be in line with the observation of attentional and memory impairments in Ecstasy users with moderate to high misuse. Despite the methodological problem of polydrug use also in our approach, our EEG results may be indicative of the neuropathophysiological background of the reported memory and attentional deficits in Ecstasy abusers. Overall, our findings may suggest the usefulness of EEG in diagnostic approaches in assessing neurotoxic sequela of this common drug abuse. © 2010 Adamaszek et al.","[0, 0, 0, 1]"
"558","Improvement in suicidal ideation after ketamine infusion: relationship to reductions in depression and anxiety.^\nOBJECTIVE: Suicide is a psychiatric emergency. Currently, there are no approved pharmacologic treatments for suicidal ideation. Ketamine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that rapidly reduces suicidal ideation as well as depression and anxiety, but the dynamic between these symptoms is not known. The aim of this analysis was to evaluate whether ketamine has an impact on suicidal thoughts, independent of depressive and anxiety symptoms. METHODS: 133 patients with treatment-resistant depression (major depressive disorder or bipolar I/II disorder) received a single subanesthetic infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min). Post-hoc correlations and linear mixed models evaluated the relationship between suicidal ideation and depression and anxiety symptoms using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) focusing on 230 min post-infusion. RESULTS: At 230 min post-infusion, correlations between changes in suicidal ideation and depression ranged from 0.23 to 0.44 (p < .05), accounting for up to 19% in the variance of ideation change. Correlations with anxiety ranged from 0.23 to 0.40 (p < .05), accounting for similar levels of variance. Ketamine infusion was associated with significant reductions in suicidal ideation compared to placebo, when controlling for the effects of ketamine on depression (F1,587 = 10.31, p = .001) and anxiety (F1,567 = 8.54, p = .004). CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in suicidal ideation after ketamine infusion are related to, but not completely driven by, improvements in depression and anxiety.

"764","RESULTS FROM THE PHASE I SMALL PHARMA TRIAL OF SPL026 IN PSYCHEDELIC-NAÏVE HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS.^\nBackground/Objective: Small Pharma is conducting the world's first regulated Phase I/IIa clinical trial of SPL026 (N,Ndimethyltryptamine [DMT] fumarate), a psychedelic compound with a shortacting experience, in combination with psychotherapy, in major depressive disorder (MDD). Design: We have completed the Phase I component, a double‐blind, singleascending dose study, assessing safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of four intravenous (IV) doses of SPL026 with therapy in psychedelic‐naive healthy volunteers (6 active and 2 placebo per cohort). Results: SPL026 was safe and well tolerated, with no serious adverse events and few drug‐related adverse events across all dose cohorts. Detailed PK profiles for DMT were elucidated, and a model was developed to understand and predict the PK profiles of various doses of SPL026. DMT is rapidly metabolized, with a half‐life of about 11 minutes, which underpins the observed short psychedelic experiences of up to 30 minutes. Following PK/PD analysis, a strong exposureresponse relationship for both the intensity and quality of the psychedelic experience was demonstrated. In addition, no correlation between exposure versus age, weight, or body mass index (BMI) of subjects was shown. Conclusion: We have developed a safe and well‐tolerated IV infusion protocol and accompanying psychotherapy model for administration of SPL026 to elicit, in a dose‐predictive way, a significant psychedelic experience with the potential to provide therapeutic efficacy in a number of mental health disorders. Psychedelics, such as DMT, offer the potential of an alternative treatment paradigm to the traditional selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or psychotherapy models currently available to patients.

"1237","A novel study design to evaluate the rapid reduction of the symptoms of major depressive disorder, including suicidal ideation, in subjects assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide.^\nBackground: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with an elevated rate of mortality, primarily due to suicide. The risk of suicide in those with MDD is about 20 times that of the general population, with approximately half of all suicides occurring in depressed individuals. While conventional antidepressants are often effective in treating depressive symptoms including suicidal ideation (SI), their delayed onset of action significantly limits their utility in the treatment of patients with MDD who are at imminent risk of for suicide. Recently, several studies of ketamine and esketamine have demonstrated that these agents can improve symptoms of depression in individuals with MDD within hours of administration. Additionally, preliminary studies of ketamine suggest it may have a similarly rapid effect in significantly reducing SI in subjects with MDD. As such, Janssen R&D is developing intranasal esketamine for the rapid reduction of the symptoms of MDD, including SI, in patients who are assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide. The pursuit of this novel indication has required the development of an innovative study design that allows for the detection of rapid symptom change, and addresses the safety and ethical concerns of studying an acutely suicidal patient population. This poster will discuss the design and implementation of PeRSEVERe (ESKETINSUI2001), an ongoing proof‐of‐concept study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intranasal esketamine in subjects with MDD who are assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide. Methods: PeRSEVERe is an ongoing 12‐week, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, multicenter Phase 2 study of intranasal esketamine in 70 adult subjects with MDD who are assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide. Eligible subjects must have active suicidal ideation and intent, and be in need of psychiatric hospitalization. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of intranasal esketamine 84 mg compared with intranasal placebo in reducing the symptoms of MDD, including SI, in subjects who are assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide, as measured by the change from baseline on the MADRS total score at 4 hours post‐dose on Day 1. Secondary efficacy objectives include the assessment of single and repeated doses of intranasal esketamine compared with intranasal placebo on the clinician's assessment of suicide risk as measured by the Clinical Global Judgment of Suicide Risk from the Suicide Ideation and Behavior Assessment Tool, and the subject's report of the severity in suicidal ideation as measured by the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation, through the end of the double‐blind treatment and follow‐up phases. Additionally, the study evaluates response rates (≥ 50% reduction in MADRS total score from baseline, with onset by Day 1 sustained through the end of the double‐blind treatment phase) across treatment groups. Safety objectives include the assessment of dissociative and psychosis‐like symptoms, sedation, nasal tolerability, vital signs and suicidal thinking and behavior. The study consists of a 24‐48 hour screening evaluation performed prior to the Day 1 intranasal dose, immediately followed by a 25‐day double blind treatment phase, and a 56‐day follow up phase. Given the vulnerability of the patient population, the study is being conducted in the context of standard clinical care, with all subjects receiving standard antidepressant medication and initial in‐patient hospitalization. Results: PeRSEVERe is the first large‐scale, prospective, placebo‐controlled trial of a rapidly acting antidepressant in subjects with MDD who are assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide. The study is being conducted in the United States and is currently ongoing, with over 70% of subjects enrolled. Details and rationale for the study design, outcome measures, and key efficacy times points will be discussed. Additionally, key operational insights and challenges unique to the study of a rapidly acting antidepressant in a suicidal patient population will e highlighted. Conclusions: PeRSERVERe employs innovative clinical trial methodology in a Phase 2 study for a novel indication, in a vulnerable patient population‐i.e. the rapid reduction of symptoms of MDD, including SI, in subjects assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide. Should this approach prove successful in Phase 2, similar methods will be considered in the design of subsequent pivotal trials of esketamine, and possibly other rapidly acting antidepressants.

"1272","The paradoxical psychological effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD).^\nBACKGROUND: Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a potent serotonergic hallucinogen or psychedelic that modulates consciousness in a marked and novel way. This study sought to examine the acute and mid-term psychological effects of LSD in a controlled study. METHOD: A total of 20 healthy volunteers participated in this within-subjects study. Participants received LSD (75 µg, intravenously) on one occasion and placebo (saline, intravenously) on another, in a balanced order, with at least 2 weeks separating sessions. Acute subjective effects were measured using the Altered States of Consciousness questionnaire and the Psychotomimetic States Inventory (PSI). A measure of optimism (the Revised Life Orientation Test), the Revised NEO Personality Inventory, and the Peter's Delusions Inventory were issued at baseline and 2 weeks after each session. RESULTS: LSD produced robust psychological effects; including heightened mood but also high scores on the PSI, an index of psychosis-like symptoms. Increased optimism and trait openness were observed 2 weeks after LSD (and not placebo) and there were no changes in delusional thinking. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings reinforce the view that psychedelics elicit psychosis-like symptoms acutely yet improve psychological wellbeing in the mid to long term. It is proposed that acute alterations in mood are secondary to a more fundamental modulation in the quality of cognition, and that increased cognitive flexibility subsequent to serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) stimulation promotes emotional lability during intoxication and leaves a residue of 'loosened cognition' in the mid to long term that is conducive to improved psychological wellbeing.","[0, 0, 0, 1]"
"1278","Neural correlates of the LSD experience revealed by multimodal neuroimaging.^\nLysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is the prototypical psychedelic drug, but its effects on the human brain have never been studied before with modern neuroimaging. Here, three complementary neuroimaging techniques: arterial spin labeling (ASL), blood oxygen leveldependent (BOLD) measures, and magnetoencephalography (MEG), implemented during resting state conditions, revealed marked changes in brain activity after LSD that correlated strongly with its characteristic psychological effects. Increased visual cortex cerebral blood flow (CBF), decreased visual cortex alpha power, and a greatly expanded primary visual cortex (V1) functional connectivity profile correlated strongly with ratings of visual hallucinations, implying that intrinsic brain activity exerts greater influence on visual processing in the psychedelic state, thereby defining its hallucinatory quality. LSD's marked effects on the visual cortex did not significantly correlate with the drug's other characteristic effects on consciousness, however. Rather, decreased connectivity between the parahippocampus and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) correlated strongly with ratings of ""ego-dissolution"" and ""altered meaning,"" implying the importance of this particular circuit for the maintenance of ""self"" or ""ego"" and its processing of ""meaning."" Strong relationships were also found between the different imaging metrics, enabling firmer inferences to be made about their functional significance. This uniquely comprehensive examination of the LSD state represents an important advance in scientific research with psychedelic drugs at a time of growing interest in their scientific and therapeutic value. The present results contribute important new insights into the characteristic hallucinatory and consciousness- altering properties of psychedelics that inform on how they can model certain pathological states and potentially treat others.","[0, 0, 0, 1]"

DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: A hospital in Hong Kong. PATIENTS: Female ex-ketamine abusers admitted to a local drug rehabilitation centre and age-matched controls attending a general gynaecology clinic between December 2009 and April 2010. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Evaluation of urinary symptoms based on a 3-day bladder diary, and responses to the Urogenital Distress Inventory Short Form (UDI-6) and the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire Short Form (IIQ-7). The study group had repeat measurements 3 months later. RESULTS: Overall, 90% of ex-ketamine abusers had active urinary symptoms. On average, they had increased 24-hour urinary frequency (10.0 vs 5.8; P=0.001) and lower maximum voided volume (253.3 mL vs 401.9 mL; P<0.001) compared to controls. Correspondingly, the median functional bladder capacity was smaller (195.3 mL vs 261.2 mL; P=0.011) and the mean UDI-6 and IIQ-7 scores were higher (P<0.001). Among those who abused ketamine for 2 years or more, the mean UDI-6 and IIQ-7 scores were higher (P=0.03, P=0.02 respectively). When they stopped abusing ketamine for 3 months or more, their mean 24-hour urinary frequency had decreased (P=0.03), the maximum voided volume had increased (P=0.03) and the mean UDI-6 and IIQ-7 scores had decreased (P=0.04, P=0.02 respectively), although they were still higher than in controls. After 3 more months, in the ex-ketamine abusers there had been a further decrease in 24-hour urinary frequency (P=0.01) and a further improvement in quality of life based on mean UDI-6 scores (P=0.04) but nevertheless poorer than the control group (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Female ex-ketamine abusers had significant urinary symptoms affecting their quality of life when studied at a mean of 8 (range, 0.5-48) months after cessation of use. The symptom severity was inversely correlated with the duration of cessation; though they improved with time, some still persisted.","[0, 1, 0, 0]"

The primary outcome will be changed on the Montgomery‐Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) during the course of the trial. The study is in running. Results: This study can potentially yield evidence on the use of IM ketamine in the treatment of depressive disorders as an ultra‐rapid low‐cost therapy associated with less patient discomfort and reduced use of medical resources, and can elucidate long‐term effects on different outcomes, such as neuropsychological aspects. Conclusions: The trial can help promote the introduction of a novel accessible approach for the treatment of complex disease (TRD) and also allow refinement of its long‐term use.

"1787","Low dose ketamine infusion for comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder and chronic pain: A randomized double-blind clinical trial.^\nObjective: To date, treatment options (i.e. psychotherapy, antidepressant medications) for patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), are relatively few, and considering their limited efficacy, novel therapies have gained interest among researchers and treatment providers alike. Among patients with chronic pain (CP) about one third experience comorbid PTSD, which further complicates their already challenging pharmacological regimens. Low dose ketamine infusion has shown promise in PTSD, and in treatment of CP, however they have not been studied in comorbid population and under rigorous control conditions. Methods: We compared the effects of a single dose of either ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or ketorolac (15 mg) over a 40-minute of IV infusion in CP patients with and without PTSD, in double blind, randomized study. Measures were collected before, during, one day and seven days after the infusion. A planned sample size of 40 patients randomly assigned to treatment order was estimated to provide 80% power to detect a hypothesized treatment difference after the infusion. Main Outcome and Measures: The primary outcome measures were change in PTSD symptom severity assessed with the Impact of Event Scale–Revised (IES-R) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain administered by a study clinician 24 hours post infusion. Secondary outcome measures included Impact of Event Scale–Revised (IES-R), VAS and Brief Pain Inventory (Short Form) for pain 1 week after the infusion. Results: Both treatments offered comparable improvement of PTSD and CP symptoms that persisted for 7 days after the infusion. Patients with comorbid PTSD and CP experienced less dissociative side effects compared to the CP group. Surprisingly, ketorolac infusion resulted in dissociative symptoms in CP patients only. Conclusions: This first prospective study comparing effects of subanesthetic ketamine versus ketorolac infusions for comorbid PTSD and CP, suggests that both ketamine and ketorolac might offer meaningful and durable response for both PTSD and CP symptoms.

"1806","A Single Ketamine Infusion Combined With Motivational Enhancement Therapy for Alcohol Use Disorder: A Randomized Midazolam-Controlled Pilot Trial.^\nOBJECTIVE: Pharmacotherapy and behavioral treatments for alcohol use disorder are limited in their effectiveness, and new treatments with innovative mechanisms would be valuable. In this pilot study, the authors tested whether a single subanesthetic infusion of ketamine administered to adults with alcohol dependence and engaged in motivational enhancement therapy affects drinking outcomes. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to a 52-minute intravenous administration of ketamine (0.71 mg/kg, N=17) or the active control midazolam (0.025 mg/kg, N=23), provided during the second week of a 5-week outpatient regimen of motivational enhancement therapy. Alcohol use following the infusion was assessed with timeline followback method, with abstinence confirmed by urine ethyl glucuronide testing. A longitudinal logistic mixed-effects model was used to model daily abstinence from alcohol over the 21 days after ketamine infusion. RESULTS: Participants (N=40) were mostly middle-aged (mean age=53 years [SD=9.8]), predominantly white (70.3%), and largely employed (71.8%) and consumed an average of five drinks per day prior to entering the study. Ketamine significantly increased the likelihood of abstinence, delayed the time to relapse, and reduced the likelihood of heavy drinking days compared with midazolam. Infusions were well tolerated, with no participants removed from the study as a result of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: A single ketamine infusion was found to improve measures of drinking in persons with alcohol dependence engaged in motivational enhancement therapy. These preliminary data suggest new directions in integrated pharmacotherapy-behavioral treatments for alcohol use disorder. Further research is needed to replicate these promising results in a larger sample.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"1871","Study protocol of an open-label proof-of-concept trial examining the safety and clinical efficacy of psilocybin-assisted therapy for veterans with PTSD.^\nINTRODUCTION: Psilocybin-assisted therapy has shown significant promise in treating the cluster of mood and anxiety symptoms that comprise post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) but has yet to be tested specifically in this condition. Furthermore, current pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments for PTSD are difficult to tolerate and limited in efficacy, especially in the US Military Veteran (USMV) population. This open-label pilot study will examine the safety and efficacy of two psilocybin administration sessions (15 mg and 25 mg), combined with psychotherapy, among USMVs with severe, treatment resistant PTSD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will recruit 15 USMVs with severe, treatment resistant PTSD. Participants will receive one low dose (15 mg) and one moderate/high dose (25 mg) of psilocybin in conjunction with preparatory and post-psilocybin therapy sessions. The primary safety outcome will be the type, severity and frequency of adverse events and suicidal ideation/behaviour, as measured by the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. The primary outcome measure for PTSD will be the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale-5. The primary endpoint will be 1 month following the second psilocybin administration session, and the total follow-up time will be 6 months. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: All participants will be required to provide written informed consent.

"1950","Sustained effects of ecstasy on the human brain: A prospective neuroimaging study in novel users.^\nPrevious studies have suggested toxic effects of recreational ecstasy use on the serotonin system of the brain. However, it cannot be excluded that observed differences between users and non-users are the cause rather than the consequence of ecstasy use. As part of the Netherlands XTC Toxicity (NeXT) study, we prospectively assessed sustained effects of ecstasy use on the brain in novel ecstasy users using repeated measurements with a combination of different neuroimaging parameters of neurotoxicity. At baseline, 188 ecstasy-naive volunteers with high probability of first ecstasy use were examined. After a mean period of 17 months follow-up, neuroimaging was repeated in 59 incident ecstasy users and 56 matched persistent ecstasy-naives and their outcomes were compared. Neuroimaging included [123I]β- carbomethoxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl)tropane (CIT) SPECT to measure serotonin transporter densities as indicators of serotonergic function; 1H-MR spectroscopy (1H-MRS) to measure brain metabolites as indicators of neuronal damage; diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to measure the apparent diffusion coefficient and fractional anisotropy (FA) of the diffusional motion of water molecules in the brain as indicators of axonal integrity; and perfusion weighted imaging (PWI) to measure regional relative cerebral blood volume (rrCBV) which indicates brain perfusion. With this approach, both structural (1H-MRS and DTI) and functional ([123I]β-CIT SPECT and PWI) aspects of neurotoxicity were combined. Compared to persistent ecstasy-naives, novel low-dose ecstasy users (mean 6.0, median 2.0 tablets) showed decreased rrCBV in the globus pallidus and putamen; decreased FA in thalamus and frontoparietal white matter; increased FA in globus pallidus; and increased apparent diffusion coefficient in the thalamus. No changes in serotonin transporter densities and brain metabolites were observed. These findings suggest sustained effects of ecstasy on brain microvasculature, white matter maturation and possibly axonal damage due to low dosages of ecstasy. Although we do not know yet whether these effects are reversible or not, we cannot exclude that ecstasy even in low doses is neurotoxic to the brain. © The Author (2008).

METHOD: In a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept trial, 41 participants received either 1 mg/kg oral ketamine or placebo thrice weekly for 21 days (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02037503). Evaluation was performed at baseline, 40 and 240 min post administration and on days 3, 7, 14 and 21. The main outcome measure was change in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). RESULTS: Twenty-two participants were randomised to the ketamine group, and 19 to the control, with 82.5% (n = 33) completing the study. In the ketamine group, a decrease in depressive symptoms was evident at all time points, whereas in the control group a decrease was evident only 40 min post administration. The reduction in MADRS score on day 21 was 12.75 in the ketamine group versus 2.49 points with placebo (P &lt; 0.001). Six participants in the ketamine group (27.3%) achieved remission compared with none of the controls (P &lt; 0.05). The number needed to treat for remission was 3.7.

"2176","Reduced memory skills and increased hair cortisol levels in recent Ecstasy/MDMA users: Significant but independent neurocognitive and neurohormonal deficits.^\nObjectives The goals of this study were to measure the neurocognitive performance of recent users of recreational Ecstasy and investigate whether it was associated with the stress hormone cortisol. Methods The 101 participants included 27 recent light users of Ecstasy (one to four times in the last 3 months), 23 recent heavier Ecstasy users (five or more times) and 51 non-users. Rivermead paragraph recall provided an objective measure for immediate and delayed recall. The prospective and retrospective memory questionnaire provided a subjective index of memory deficits. Cortisol levels were taken from near-scalp 3-month hair samples. Results Cortisol was significantly raised in recent heavy Ecstasy users compared with controls, whereas hair cortisol in light Ecstasy users was not raised. Both Ecstasy groups were significantly impaired on the Rivermead delayed word recall, and both groups reported significantly more retrospective and prospective memory problems. Stepwise regression confirmed that lifetime Ecstasy predicted the extent of these memory deficits. Conclusions Recreational Ecstasy is associated with increased levels of the bio-energetic stress hormone cortisol and significant memory impairments. No significant relationship between cortisol and the cognitive deficits was observed. Ecstasy users did display evidence of a metacognitive deficit, with the strength of the correlations between objective and subjective memory performances being significantly lower in the Ecstasy users.","[0, 1, 1, 0]"
"2244","Major depression: The relative contribution of gender, MDMA, and cannabis use.^\nPrevious research has suggested that 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy) users have elevated depressive symptomatology, although it is not clear whether this is due to MDMA or other drug use. This study aimed to investigate the contributions of MDMA and cannabis use to Major Depressive Disorder in MDMA users. A total of 226 MDMA users were studied. Participants (65% male) reported an average number of 35.8 uses of MDMA (SD = 45.6, range = 2-400). Participants were administered a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Twenty-six individuals (11.5%) met lifetime criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. High rates of lifetime Cannabis Abuse (30.1%) and Cannabis Dependence (12.4%) were reported. No association was found between number of uses of MDMA and Major Depressive Disorder. Those with lifetime major depression were found, however, to have higher rates of lifetime cannabis use disorder (adjusted OR = 2.40). A logistic regression indicated that lifetime cannabis use disorder, but not MDMA use, was significantly associated with lifetime Major Depressive Disorder. Stratified analyses suggested that for males, neither drug use variable was associated with major depression. For females, a lifetime cannabis use disorder (adjusted OR = 4.99), but not MDMA use, was associated with lifetime Major Depressive Disorder. Results of this study suggest that although MDMA use was not found to be significantly associated with major depression for either gender, a lifetime cannabis use disorder was significantly associated with lifetime major depression for female, but not male, users of MDMA.","[0, 1, 0, 0]"
"3189","Psilocybin treatment for anxiety in patients with advanced-stage cancer.^\nBackground: From the late 1950s to the early 1970s clinical research was conducted exploring the use of hallucinogens to treat the existential anxiety, despair and isolation often associated with advanced‐stage cancer. These reports described critically ill individuals undergoing psycho spiritual epiphanies, frequently with sustained improvement in anxiety, mood and quality of life. While these promising investigations were halted because of political and cultural pressures, after a thirty year hiatus the development of hallucinogen treatment research for patients with anxiety reactive to advanced‐stage cancer has resumed. Methods: This presentation examines the rationale, methodology and results of a pilot investigation using psilocybin to treat the existential anxiety associated with advanced‐stage cancer. Psilocybin, the active alkaloid in hallucinogenic mushrooms and a 5‐HT2A and 5‐HT2C agonist, was administered to 12 screened subjects diagnosed with advanced‐stage cancer and anxiety. A double‐blind, placebo‐controlled methodology was employed, utilizing a moderate dosage of psilocybin, 0.2 mg/kg. Treatment sessions were conducted on the Clinical Research Unit at Harbor‐UCLA Medical Center. Results: Safe physiological and psychological responses were documented during treatment sessions. There were no clinically significant adverse events with psilocybin. The State‐Trait Anxiety Inventory trait anxiety subscale demonstrated a significant reduction in anxiety at 1 and 3 months after treatment. The Beck Depression Inventory revealed an improvement of mood that reached significance at 6 months; the Profile of Mood States identified mood improvement after treatment with psilocybin that approached but did not reach significance. Conclusions: This study establishes the feasibility and safety of administering moderate doses of psilocybin to patients with advanced‐stage cancer and anxiety. Some of the data revealed a positive trend toward improved mood and anxiety. These results support the need for more research in this long‐neglected field. To that end, two new studies using psilocybin to treat cancer anxiety, at Johns Hopkins and New York University, are currently on‐going. Both of these investigations are evaluating higher doses than used in the Harbor‐UCLA study, allowing for greater exploration of the role of psycho‐spiritual or transcendent states of consciousness in facilitating therapeutic outcomes.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"3238","19.3 Psilocybin-Assisted Therapy for MDD: current Evidence and Clinical Considerations.^\nObjectives: Psilocybin‐assisted therapy is currently being investigated for its therapeutic potential in the treatment of MDD in adults. This talk will review the typical therapeutic approach, along with some of the major findings in this area to date, with a focus on the results from a prospective long‐term follow‐up study of patients with moderate to severe depression who received 2 doses of psilocybin in a supported setting. Methods: This randomized, waiting‐list controlled study enrolled 27 patients aged 21 to 75 years with moderate to severe unipolar depression (GRID‐HAMD ≥17). Participants were randomized to an immediate or delayed (8 weeks) treatment condition in which they received 2 doses of psilocybin with supportive psychotherapy. Twenty‐four participants completed both psilocybin sessions and were followed through 12 months following their second dose. Results: All 24 participants attended all follow‐up visits through the 12‐month timepoint. Large decreases from baseline in GRID Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (GRID‐HAMD) scores were observed at 1‐, 3‐, 6‐, and 12‐month follow‐up (Cohen d = 2.3, 2.0, 2.6, and 2.4, respectively). Treatment response (≥50% reduction in GRID‐HAMD score from baseline) and remission were 75% and 58%, respectively, at 12 months. There were no serious adverse events judged to be related to psilocybin in the long‐term follow‐up period, and no participants reported psilocybin use outside of the context of the study. Participant ratings of personal meaning, spiritual experience, and mystical experience after the sessions predicted increased well‐being at 12 months but did not predict improvement in depression. One‐third of the participants began treatment with an antidepressant medication during the follow‐up period. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that the substantial antidepressant effects of psilocybin‐assisted therapy may be durable at least through 12 months following acute intervention in some patients. Contextual factors and psychotherapy likely play a substantial role in the safety and efficacy of the treatment and will require careful consideration if this intervention is studied in younger patient populations.

"4634","MDMA, oxytocin and empathy: preliminary results from a placebo controlled study.^\nObjective: Background. The neurobiological mechanism underlying MDMA‐induced prosocial behaviour (PSB) is yet not known. Two potential mediators of these effects are oxytocin and the serotonin (5‐HT) 1a‐receptor as they seem to play a role in facilitation of positive mood, empathy and social interaction. Moreover, MDMA is known to increase blood oxytocin levels and the 5‐HT1a‐receptor is a mediator of the effects of MDMA and oxytocin. The study aim is to investigate the roles of oxytocin and the 5‐HT1a‐receptor in the MDMA‐induced PSB effects. Methods: Twenty participants will participate in this 4 waycrossover study (currently N=5). Treatments are MDMA (75 mg, oral) alone, and in combination with a 5‐HT1a antagonist (pindolol, 20mg, oral), Oxytocin (48 IU, intranasal), and placebo. Empathy and mood are assessed by means of two computer tasks (Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test and the Multifaceted Empathy test) and a questionnaire (Profile of Mood States). It is hypothesized that oxytocin will mimic MDMA‐induced prosocial effects and that the 5‐HT1Areceptor is an important mediator of these effects. Results: Preliminary analyses of both empathy tests did not reveal statistically significant main effects of treatment. Analyses of the POMS revealed a main effect of treatment on the 'vigor' scale (Figure presented) (p=0.032) and a trend on the 'arousal' and ' elation' scale. These 'stimulant' effects were caused by the combined treatment and oxytocin. Closer inspection of the data however leads to the suggestion that an increase in power will lead to significant effects (also of MDMA) on more scales. Conclusion: The data of the POMS questionnaire suggest that the three active treatments have 'stimulant ' effects on different mood states. Inclusion of more subjects will provide more clarity on the role of oxytocin and the 5‐HT1a‐receptor in MDMA‐induced PSB.","[0, 0, 0, 1]"
"4640","Ayahuasca enhances creative divergent thinking while decreasing conventional convergent thinking.^\nINTRODUCTION: Ayahuasca is a South American psychotropic plant tea traditionally used in Amazonian shamanism. The tea contains the psychedelic 5-HT2A receptor agonist N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), plus β-carboline alkaloids with monoamine oxidase-inhibiting properties. Increasing evidence from anecdotal reports and open-label studies indicates that ayahuasca may have therapeutic effects in treatment of substance use disorders and depression. A recent study on the psychological effects of ayahuasca found that the tea reduces judgmental processing and inner reactivity, classic goals of mindfulness psychotherapy. Another psychological facet that could potentially be targeted by ayahuasca is creative divergent thinking. This mode of thinking can enhance and strengthen psychological flexibility by allowing individuals to generate new and effective cognitive, emotional, and behavioral strategies. The present study aimed to assess the potential effects of ayahuasca on creative thinking. METHODS: We visited two spiritual ayahuasca workshops and invited participants to conduct creativity tests before and during the acute effects of ayahuasca. In total, 26 participants consented. Creativity tests included the ""pattern/line meanings test"" (PLMT) and the ""picture concept test"" (PCT), both assessing divergent thinking and the latter also assessing convergent thinking. RESULTS: While no significant effects were found for the PLMT, ayahuasca intake significantly modified divergent and convergent thinking as measured by the PCT. While convergent thinking decreased after intake, divergent thinking increased. CONCLUSIONS: The present data indicate that ayahuasca enhances creative divergent thinking. They suggest that ayahuasca increases psychological flexibility, which may facilitate psychotherapeutic interventions and support clinical trial initiatives.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"4645","Acute effects of nocturnal doses of MDMA on measures of impulsivity and psychomotor performance throughout the night.^\nINTRODUCTION: Previous studies on the acute effects of MDMA on psychomotor performance and impulsivity showed that MDMA acts as a stimulant. These studies assessed performance during daytime, whereas in real life, dance-attendees leaving a party use the drug during the night. OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to assess the effects of nocturnal doses of MDMA on psychomotor performance and impulsivity during the night and after a night of sleep deprivation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen healthy subjects participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-way within-subject study. The treatment was MDMA (75 and 50 mg) divided over the evening or double placebo. Psychomotor and impulsivity tasks were conducted four times throughout the evening and night. A vigilance test was conducted once, at 5 A.M.,: and a sleepiness scale was presented to the subjects ten times throughout the evening and night. RESULTS: MDMA impaired tracking performance in a simple tracking task. Divided attention task performance was also impaired as indicated by a decrease in secondary task performance under the influence of MDMA compared with placebo. MDMA did not affect impulsivity measures. Vigilance performance decreased as a function of time on task, but this decrement was less during MDMA treatment compared to placebo. After the administration of MDMA, the sleepiness scale scores were lower during the night when compared with placebo. This difference between MDMA and placebo disappeared in the morning. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that nocturnal doses of MDMA may produce impairments of tracking performance and divided attention throughout the night that are additive to performance impairment produced by sleep loss.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"4678","Classic Psychedelic Use and Mechanisms of Mental Health: Exploring the Mediating Roles of Spirituality and Emotion Processing on Symptoms of Anxiety, Depressed Mood, and Disordered Eating in a Community Sample.^\nA resurgence of research has begun to systematically examine the relationship between psychedelic use and mental health and well-being. Although preliminary findings examining the therapeutic value of these substances show promise, the mechanisms through which psychedelic use may predict reduced mental distress remain poorly understood. To this end, we surveyed a community sample of individuals (n = 159) who endorsed lifetime psychedelic use to examine relationships among psychedelic use and self-reported spirituality, difficulties in emotion regulation, and symptoms of mental health issues. Results revealed a pathway through which classic psychedelic use predicted greater spirituality, which in turn predicted better emotion regulation, ultimately predicting lower levels of anxiety, depressed mood, and disordered eating. These results contribute to our understanding of potential mechanisms of change with respect to psychedelics and mental health. They also add to the growing body of literature pointing to the healing effects of the cultivation of spirituality and emotion regulation as separate and related constructs.","[0, 0, 0, 1]"
"4785","LSD-induced entropic brain activity predicts subsequent personality change.^\nPersonality is known to be relatively stable throughout adulthood. Nevertheless, it has been shown that major life events with high personal significance, including experiences engendered by psychedelic drugs, can have an enduring impact on some core facets of personality. In the present, balanced-order, placebo-controlled study, we investigated biological predictors of post-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) changes in personality. Nineteen healthy adults underwent resting state functional MRI scans under LSD (75µg, I.V.) and placebo (saline I.V.). The Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R) was completed at screening and 2 weeks after LSD/placebo. Scanning sessions consisted of three 7.5-min eyes-closed resting-state scans, one of which involved music listening. A standardized preprocessing pipeline was used to extract measures of sample entropy, which characterizes the predictability of an fMRI time-series. Mixed-effects models were used to evaluate drug-induced shifts in brain entropy and their relationship with the observed increases in the personality trait openness at the 2-week follow-up. Overall, LSD had a pronounced global effect on brain entropy, increasing it in both sensory and hierarchically higher networks across multiple time scales. These shifts predicted enduring increases in trait openness. Moreover, the predictive power of the entropy increases was greatest for the music-listening scans and when ""ego-dissolution"" was reported during the acute experience. These results shed new light on how LSD-induced shifts in brain dynamics and concomitant subjective experience can be predictive of lasting changes in personality.

"4888","Pilot study suggests DNA methylation of the glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1) is associated with MDMA-assisted therapy treatment response for severe PTSD.^\nBACKGROUND: Previous research has demonstrated that epigenetic changes in specific hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) genes may predict successful psychotherapy in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A recent Phase 3 clinical trial reported high efficacy of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted therapy for treating patients with severe PTSD compared to a therapy with placebo group (NCT03537014). This raises important questions regarding potential mechanisms of MDMA-assisted therapy. In the present study, we examined epigenetic changes in three key HPA axis genes before and after MDMA and placebo with therapy. As a pilot sub-study to the parent clinical trial, we assessed potential HPA epigenetic predictors for treatment response with genomic DNA derived from saliva (MDMA, n = 16; placebo, n = 7). Methylation levels at all 259 CpG sites annotated to three HPA genes (CRHR1, FKBP5, and NR3C1) were assessed in relation to treatment response as measured by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5; Total Severity Score). Second, group (MDMA vs. placebo) differences in methylation change were assessed for sites that predicted treatment response. RESULTS: Methylation change across groups significantly predicted symptom reduction on 37 of 259 CpG sites tested, with two sites surviving false discovery rate (FDR) correction. Further, the MDMA-treatment group showed more methylation change compared to placebo on one site of the NR3C1 gene. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that therapy-related PTSD symptom improvements may be related to DNA methylation changes in HPA genes and such changes may be greater in those receiving MDMA-assisted therapy. These findings can be used to generate hypothesis driven analyses for future studies with larger cohorts.","[0, 0, 0, 1]"
"4905","The potential role of lysergic acid diethylamide for psychological assisted therapy: A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials in healthy volunteers.^\nOBJECTIVE: In recent years, interest in using lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in psychiatric research and corresponding therapy has increased rapidly. In this meta-analysis, we explored the effects of LSD on healthy subjects with respect to subjective drug effects, blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature and side effects. METHOD: PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched from January 2010 to December 2020 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of LSD in healthy people. Subsequently, 5 RCTs with 132 healthy people which focused on the effects of LSD were enrolled in our study. RESULT: We found that taking 50, 100 and 200 mcg LSD doses were associated with a significant increase in the maximal difference from the baseline compared to the placebo group among the outcomes of AMRS (Adjective Mood Rating Scale) score. Significant differences existed between the LSD and placebo groups when taking 100 and 200 mcg LSD in acute adverse effects (100 mcg: SMD = .97, 95% confidence interval [CI], .50, 1.44, Z = 4.04, p < .001; 200 mcg: SMD = 1.18, 95% CI, 0.65, 1.72, Z = 4.32, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analysis of the subjective effects of LSD in healthy people revealed moderate significant effect sizes in favor of LSD with no significant adverse effects. A 100 mcg dose of LSD has potential for use in psychological-assisted therapy and may improve the mental fitness of patients with disease-related psychiatric distress. Additional clinical trials are necessary to explore the efficacy and safety of LSD as a psychological-assisted therapy.","[0, 0, 0, 1]"

The present article provides an overview on the current evidence on substance-assisted psychotherapy with these substances. Method A selective search was carried out in the PubMed and Cochrane Library including studies investigating the clinical use of serotonergic psychoactive substances since 2000. Results Studies were found investigating the following indications: alcohol (LSD and psilocybin) and tobacco addiction (psilocybin), anxiety and depression in patients suffering from life-threatening somatic illness (LSD and psilocybin), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (psilocybin), treatment-resistant major depression (psilocybin), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (MDMA). Discussion Substance use disorders, PTSD and anxiety and depression in patients suffering from life-threatening somatic illness belong to the indications with the best evidence for substance-assisted psychotherapy with serotonergic psychoactive agents. To date, studies indicate efficacy and relatively good tolerability. Further studies are needed to determine whether these substances may represent suitable and effective treatment options for some treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders in the future.","[0, 0, 0, 1]"

Participants were 16-22 years old. They identified themselves to be primary users of cocaine hydrochloride, crack cocaine, or ecstasy and were subsequently assigned to these primary stimulant groups for analysis. No participant had been in treatment during the previous 12 months and none had a treatment history for opiate dependence or injecting. Trial participants were recruited in 11 sites in Greater London and Kent using detached outreach, specific advertising campaigns, and by participant-driven snowball-sampling methods. Six-month follow-up interviews were successfully conducted with 299 participants. The participant recruitment methodology used in the trial was successful, showing that longitudinal, experimental studies with young out-of-treatment drug users are quite feasible.

"5460","The effect of catecholamine depletion by alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine on measures of cognitive performance and sleep in abstinent MDMA users.^\n(±) 3, 4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a popular recreational drug of abuse and a brain serotonin (5-HT) neurotoxin in animals. Growing evidence suggests that humans who use MDMA recreationally can also develop 5-HT neurotoxic injury, although functional consequences have been difficult to identify. Twenty-five abstinent MDMA users and 23 non-MDMA using controls were studied to determine whether pharmacologic depletion of brain catecholamines by alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine (AMPT) would differentially effect MDMA users on measures of cognition and sleep, two processes dually modulated by brain serotonergic and catecholaminergic neurons. During a 5-day in-patient study, all subjects underwent formal neuropsychiatric testing, repeated computerized cognitive testing, and all-night sleep studies. At baseline, MDMA users had performance deficits on tasks of verbal and visuospatial working memory and displayed increased behavioral impulsivity on several computerized tasks, reflecting a tendency to perform quickly at the expense of accuracy. Baseline sleep architecture was also altered in abstinent MDMA users compared to controls. AMPT produced differential effects in MDMA users compared to controls on several cognitive and sleep measures. Differences in cognitive performance, impulsivity, and sleep were significantly correlated with MDMA use. These data extend findings from earlier studies demonstrating cognitive deficits, behavioral impulsivity, and sleep alterations in abstinent MDMA users, and suggest that lasting effects of MDMA lead to alterations in the ability to modulate behaviors reciprocally influenced by 5-HT and catecholamines. More research is needed to determine potential relationships between sleep abnormalities, cognitive deficits and impulsive behavior in abstinent MDMA users. © 2007 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.","[0, 0, 0, 1]"
"5556","Individual differences in distress, impulsivity, and coping motives for use as predictors of problematic ecstasy use.^\nBackground: Ecstasy users who report problematic use of ecstasy experience adverse social, psychological, and health-related consequences not reported by non-problem users. Relatively little is known about the risk factors for the development of problematic ecstasy use. Such information would be valuable for targeted intervention, prevention, and education Aims: The current study aimed to fill this gap by investigating several hypothesised risk factors for problematic use and the relationships between them. Methods: Self-reported impulsivity, psychological distress, sex, and coping motives for ecstasy use were investigated as predictors of problematic ecstasy use in a cross-sectional online survey. Results: The sample consisted of 483 individuals (60.5% male, 38.3% female, 1.2% other) aged 18–62 years, reporting ecstasy use on an average of 59.7 occasions (SD = 167.8). Both higher self-reported impulsivity and psychological distress predicted problem ecstasy use, and both these relationships were partially mediated by coping motives. When these variables were examined in a combined mediation model accounting for their covariance, psychological distress still predicted problematic use partially via an effect on coping motives, while impulsivity showed only a direct effect on problem use. No sex differences in problem ecstasy use were observed. Conclusions: Increased trait impulsivity and psychological distress appear to confer greater risk of problematic ecstasy use. Targeting these factors, as well as coping motives for ecstasy use, may be useful in efforts to prevent and reduce problematic ecstasy use among those who use the drug.","[0, 1, 0, 0]"
"5723","Effect of local wound infiltration with ketamine versus dexmedetomidine on postoperative pain and stress after abdominal hysterectomy, a randomized trial.^\nBackground and Objectives: Postoperative pain and stress elicit hormonal changes. We aimed at comparing the effects of wound infiltration with ketamine versus dexmedetomidine on postoperative pain and stress response. Methods: This double‐blinded study included ninety patients scheduled for total abdominal hysterectomy and were randomly assigned into three groups to receive local wound infiltration with 40 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine (group C), plus 2 mg/kg ketamine (group K) or 2 μg/kg dexmedetomidine (group D). Primary outcome was postoperative morphine consumption; secondary outcomes included first request of analgesia, VAS scores at rest and movement (VAS–R/M) and side effects. Serum cortisol, prolactin and glucose levels at baseline, pre‐infiltration, 6 and 24 h postoperatively were measured. Results: Rescue analgesia was less in K (6.80 ± 3.19 mg) and D (8.39 ± 3.86 mg) compared to C (13.33 ± 4.01 mg) (p < 0.05). First request of analgesia was delayed in K (7.60 ± 4.16 h) and D (6.00 ± 3.73 h) compared to C (4.20 ± 1.13 h) (p < 0.05). Both VAS and R/M were significantly lower in K (all over 24 h) and D (for 8 and 4 h, respectively) compared to C. Stress markers were significantly lower in K and D compared to C at 6 and 24 h, and in K compared to D at 24 h (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Local wound infiltration with ketamine or dexmedetomidine added to bupivacaine had an opioid‐sparing effect, delayed first request of rescue analgesia, and attenuated postoperative stress response, especially with ketamine in patients underwent total abdominal hysterectomy.

"5906","Residual effects of ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) on low level visual processes.^\n'Ecstasy' (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) induces impaired functioning in the serotonergic system, including the occipital lobe. This study employed the 'tilt aftereffect' paradigm to operationalise the function of orientation-selective neurons among ecstasy consumers and controls as a means of investigating the role of reduced serotonin on visual orientation processing. The magnitude of the tilt aftereffect reflects the extent of lateral inhibition between orientation-selective neurons and is elicited to both 'real' contours, processed in visual cortex area V1, and illusory contours, processed in V2. The magnitude of tilt aftereffect to both contour types was examined among 19 ecstasy users (6 ecstasy only; 13 ecstasy-plus-cannabis users) and 23 matched controls (9 cannabis-only users; 14 drug-naive). Ecstasy users had a significantly greater tilt magnitude than non-users for real contours (Hedge's g=0.63) but not for illusory contours (g=0.20). These findings provide support for literature suggesting that residual effects of ecstasy (and reduced serotonin) impairs lateral inhibition between orientation-selective neurons in V1, which however suggests that ecstasy may not substantially affect this process in V2. Multiple studies have now demonstrated ecstasy-related deficits on basic visual functions, including orientation and motion processing. Such low-level effects may contribute to the impact of ecstasy use on neuropsychological tests of visuospatial function. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","[0, 0, 0, 1]"

Specifically, LSD has been reported to abort attacks, to decrease frequency and intensity of attacks, and to induce remission in patients suffering from cluster headache (CH). Objective: To investigate the effects of an oral LSD pulse regimen (3 x 100 µg LSD in three weeks) in patients suffering from CH compared with placebo. Design: Double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled two‐phase cross‐over study design. Participants: 30 patients aged ≥ 25 and ≤ 75 years with chronic or episodic CH with predictable periods lasting approximately 2 months and attacks responding to oxygen. Main outcome measures: Changes in frequency and intensity of CH attacks assessed with a standardized headache diary Significance: CH is often rated as the most painful of all primary headaches, which not only causes significant disability, but is also associated with enormous personal, economic, and psychiatric burden. At the moment, there is no specific treatment available for CH, but serotonergic compounds represent an important drug class, especially in the abortive management of cluster attacks. However, there is a need for new treatment approaches, as CH is also often insufficiently managed with available medication.

"6189","LSD Base and LSD Tartrate Bioequivalence and Bioavailability in Healthy Subjects.^\nLSD is widely used for recreational and spiritual purposes. Additionally LSD is currently reused in experimental studies with healthy subjects and in studies investigating its effects on patients suffering from anxiety, depression, addiction personality disorders, cluster headache, migraine, and other pathological conditions. When LSD is used recreationally, it is administered mostly in the form of LSD tartrate on filter paper (blotter) or as a liquid. In experimental research over the past years, LSD has mostly been used in the form of LSD base, which is lipophilic and therefore has typically been administered as a solution in ethanol. However, some researchers have also use LSD tartrate orally or LSD base intravenously. Currently, it is not clear how these different forms of LSD compare regarding their bioequivalence and effects. The present study therefore compares four different formulations of LSD and placebo: (1) An oral drinking solution of LSD base currently used in many research studies (100 μg LSD in 96% ethanol), (2) A solid orodispersible film containing LSD base (100 μg LSD), (3) LSD tartrate used in research and recreationally (100 μg LSD equivalent of LSD tartrate in water), (4) an intravenous administration of LSD tartrate (100 μg LSD equivalent of LSD tartrate in water), and (5) placebo for all formulations (quadruple‐dummy).

"6197","Acute Effects of 2C-B Compared With MDMA and Psilocybin in Healthy Subjects.^\n2C‐B is a phenethylamine and belongs to the so‐called 2C drugs, a group of novel psychoactive substances (NPS) with some structural similarity to the classic psychedelic mescaline. 2C‐B is relatively widely used as recreational substance often replacing or mimicking classic substances such as LSD or MDMA. 2C‐B also ranks high among the substances found as substitutes or adulterants of tablets sold as MDMA or Ecstasy. Users report that 2C‐B has similar acute effects to MDMA when used at low (5‐10 mg) and medium doses (10‐25 mg) and more psychedelic effects when used at a high doses (25‐40 mg). Additionally, in two open labeled studies the effects have been defined by the researchers as entactogenic (MDMA‐like) with psychedelic/hallucinogenic properties when administering 20 mg and on the other hand as psychedelic‐psychostimulant like when administering a mean dose of 16 mg (4 used 10 mg, 5 used 15 mg and 7 used 20 mg). Subjective effects peaked at 1‐2h and lasted 5h. The 2C drugs act mainly as agonists on the 5‐HT2A receptor very similar to classic psychedelics like LSD or psilocybin. Furthermore, 2C‐B may interact with monoaminergic systems more similar to MDMA and may share some empathogenic or even stimulant‐type actions. 2C‐B also inhibits the SERT similar to MDMA, however, only at low potency in vitro. Thus, taken together, the pharmacology of 2C‐B in vitro is somewhat inconclusive but would be consistent with both MDMA‐ and psychedelic‐type actions in vivo in humans. Increases in blood pressure and heart rate are moderate and regarded as lower than those of MDMA. No severe cases were observed. The safety profile of 2C‐B is considered to be similar to MDMA. Psilocybin is a classic serotonergic psychedelic. Psilocybin is a prodrug which is activated to psilocin within the body. The psychoactive action of psilocin primarily involves an interaction with the serotonin 5‐HT2A receptor. Currently, psilocybin is the most investigated psychedelic substance among the classic psychedelics. In particular, there are high hopes of using psilocybin in patients with treatment resistant major depression and pharmaceutical companies are currently conducting phase III studies. MDMA is an amphetamine derivative which, unlike prototypical amphetamines, predominantly enhances serotonergic neurotransmission via release of 5‐HT through the SERT and it less potently also releases dopamine and norepinephrine through the dopamine transporter (DAT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET), respectively. Furthermore, MDMA is known to trigger oxytocin release which may contribute to its effects to increase trust, prosociality, and enhanced empathy and is therefore referred to as an ""entactogen"" or ""empathogen"". Being granted as a ""breakthrough therapy"" by the FDA, MDMA is currently investigated in substance‐assisted psychotherapy for treatment of PTSD. By using a placebo‐controlled double‐blind cross‐over design the study will provide insight into the effects profiles of recreationally used psychoactive substances relevant for psychiatric research. Therefore the study will compare the acute subjective, physiological and endocrine effects of low (10 mg), medium (20 mg) and high (30 mg) doses of 2C‐B with standard doses of MDMA (125 mg) and psilocybin (25 mg) in healthy subjects. Finally, the study will also allow to newly directly compare MDMA and psilocybin effects at representative doses and within the same subjects which will provide for a better characterization of these substances increasingly used in psychiatric research.","[0, 0, 0, 1]"
"6228","LSD Treatment for Persons With Alcohol Use Disorder.^\nAlcohol use causes more overall harm than any other drug and is the seventh leading risk factor for both deaths and disability‐adjusted life years. Alcohol use disorders (AUD) are among the most common and undertreated mental disorders in developed countries. Pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments only show limited efficacy and around 60% of the patients relapse in short‐term after withdrawal. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) was extensively investigated in the 1950s and 1960s and became one of the best‐studied psychoactive substances with several thousands of early scientific reports. Specifically, the use of LSD in the treatment of AUD was investigated extensively. A pooled analysis of six historical clinical trials demonstrated, that a single dose of LSD significantly reduced alcohol use at three and six months after LSD administration and the improvements surpassed treatment with established psychopharmacological interventions. However, these historical studies do not meet today's methodological standards which limits the validity of these findings. Well‐designed studies are needed to further investigate this promising treatment approach. Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate safety and efficacy of LSD for the treatment of AUD. The trial has a double‐blind, active placebo‐controlled, randomized, parallel design and will be conducted in three specialized treatment centers for addictive disorders in Switzerland. The study will include 128 patients after withdrawal treatment and will primarily assess the efficacy of LSD for relapse prevention after standard detoxification. Patients will be treated using a 1:1 allocation. In the first session, patients in the treatment group will receive a dose of 150 µg LSD, followed by another 150 µg or 250 µg LSD in the second session, which will take place approximately 4 weeks after the first session. The primary outcome is the mean of percent heavy drinking days after administration of two doses of LSD at 3 months' follow‐up. Additionally, other alcohol associated parameters and associated common comorbidities as well as potential predictors and mediators for treatment response will be assessed.","[0, 1, 0, 0]"

Use of buprenorphine follow standard of care, and the investigators are investigating the additive power of adjunctive psilocybin to enhance opioid abstinence, treatment adherence, quality of life, and mood. The study will consist of a brief (6‐8 day) inpatient phase for standard buprenorphine induction as well as experimental psilocybin administration, an 8‐week outpatient phase involving standard buprenorphine maintenance and experimental follow‐up meetings, and long‐term follow‐up sessions for 4 months after. During the inpatient phase, participants will be inducted onto sublingual (SL) buprenorphine (using a buprenorphine/naloxone combination product) while admitted to the Bayview Clinical Research Unit. During this time, participants will also undergo 2‐3 preparatory sessions, and will undergo an experimental drug administration session under supportive conditions, during which the participants will receive either a very low dose (1 mg) or a single high (30mg) oral dose of psilocybin under double‐blind conditions. At the end of the inpatient phase, participants will be discharged to complete the 8‐week outpatient phase, during which participants will undergo visits at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 weeks post‐dosing session for monitoring of adverse events, clinical status, treatment adherence, and to receive a weekly supply of buprenorphine.

Ten in-patients with neuropathic pain participated in this single-blind, placebo-controlled study after giving written informed consent. Following intravenous injections of a saline solution (placebo), three bolus injections of 5 mg ketamine HCl were administered at 5 min intervals. Changes in pain perception were assessed using a numerical rating scale for pain. Behavioral changes, including psychotomimetic effects, were assessed using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Electroencephalograms (EEG) and electrooculograms (EOG) were recorded continuously throughout the testing period. One minute EEG and closed-eye eye movements were quantified. The effects of ketamine were evaluated by comparing the neurophysiological and behavioral parameters obtained from the placebo and ketamine trials. Pain reduction was significantly correlated with ketamine-induced changes in hallucinatory behavior and excitement as measured by the BPRS. Ketamine injections caused a significant decrease in the EEGalpha amplitude without an accompanying reduction in EEG frequency. The EEGalpha amplitude reduction at the right central electrode was significantly related to subjective pain relief. Subanesthetic doses of ketamine significantly decreased rapid eye movements, but did not initiate slow eye movements. In conclusion, the present EEG-EOG/behavioral results indicate that ketamine-induced failure of neural integration between cortical-subcortical regions induces psychotic symptoms and alters pain perception on neuropathic pain.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"

MDMA produced a time-dependent decrease in the CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio due to a decrease in the number of CD4 T-helper cells, a decrease in the functional responsiveness of lymphocytes to mitogenic stimulation, and a simultaneous increase in natural killer cells. In case of two 100 mg MDMA doses given 4 hour apart, immune alterations produced by the first dose were strengthened by the second one. At 24 hours after treatment, statistically significant residual effects were observed for all the altered immune parameters after the administration of two MDMA doses if compared to single dose and placebo. In the second clinical trial, the second 100 mg MDMA dose given 24 hours after the first dose produced immunological changes significantly greater than those induced by the initial drug administration and which seemed to show a delayed onset. Significant residual effects were observed for all the immune parameters as late as 48 hours after the second dose. These results show that repeated administration of MDMA with both a short and a long time interval between doses extends the critical period following MDMA administration, already observed after a single dose, in which immunocompetence is severely compromised.","[0, 1, 0, 0]"
"7126","Elevated impulsivity and impaired decision-making cognition in heavy users of MDMA (""Ecstasy"").^\nRationale: In animal studies, the common club drug 3,4- methylendioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""Ecstasy"") consistently caused a prolonged loss of presynaptic serotonergic neurons, and evidence suggests that MDMA consumption may also affect the human serotonergic system. Serotonin (5-HT) has been implicated in the regulation of impulsivity and such executive functions as decision-making cognition. In fact, MDMA users have shown elevated impulsivity in two studies, but little is known about decision making in drug-free MDMA consumers. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the cognitive neurotoxicity of MDMA with regard to behavioral impulsivity and decision-making cognition. Methods: Nineteen male, abstinent, heavy MDMA users; 19 male, abstinent cannabis users; and 19 male, drug-naïve controls were examined with the Matching Familiar Figures Test (MFFT) as well as with a Go/No-Go Task (GNG) for impulsivity and with a Gambling Task (GT) for executive functioning. Results: MDMA users showed significantly elevated impulsivity in the MFFT Impulsivity score (I-score), but not in commission errors of the GNG, compared with controls. Cannabis users did not yield altered impulsivity compared with controls. In the GT, MDMA users performed significantly worse than cannabis consumers and controls, whereas cannabis users exhibited the same decision-making capacity as controls. In addition, the I-score as well as the decision-making performance was correlated with measures of MDMA intake. The I-score and the decision-making performance were also correlated. Conclusions: These results suggest that heavy use of MDMA may elevate behavioral impulsivity and impair decision-making cognition possibly mediated by a selective impairment of the 5-HT system. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.","[0, 1, 0, 0]"
"7278","Reduced N-acetylaspartate levels in the frontal cortex of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy) users: Preliminary results.^\nBACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The perceived safety of the recreational drug methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), or Ecstasy, conflicts with animal evidence indicating that MDMA damages cortical serotonin (5-HT) neurons at doses similar to those used by humans. Few data are available about the effects of MDMA on the human brain. This study was designed to evaluate MDMA-related alterations in metabolite ratios with single-voxel proton (1H) MR spectroscopy. METHODS: Fifteen male MDMA users (mean lifetime exposure, 723 tablets; mean time since last tablet, 12.0 weeks) and 12 age-matched control subjects underwent single-voxel 1H MR spectroscopy. N-Acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr), NAA/Choline (Cho), and myoinositol (MI)/Cr ratios were measured in midfrontal gray matter, midoccipital gray matter, and right parietal white matter. Data were analyzed with linear model-based multivariate analysis of variance. RESULTS: NAA/Cr (P = .04) and NAA/Cho (P = .03) ratios, markers associated with neuronal loss or dysfunction, were reduced in the frontal cortex of MDMA users. Neither NAA/Cr (P = .72) nor NAA/Cho (P = .12) ratios were different between both groups in occipital gray matter and parietal white matter (P = .18). Extent of previous MDMA use and frontal cortical NAA/Cr (ρ = -.50, P = .012) or NAA/Cho (ρ = -.550, P < .01) ratios were significantly associated. CONCLUSION: Reduced NAA/Cr and NAA/Cho ratios at 1H MR spectroscopy provide evidence for neuronal abnormality in the frontal cortex of MDMA users; these are correlated with the degree of MDMA exposure. These data suggest that MDMA may be a neurotoxin in humans, as it is in animals.","[0, 1, 0, 0]"
"7379","Serotonergic hallucinogens and recognition of facial emotion expressions: a systematic review of the literature.^\nBACKGROUND: Recognition of emotions in facial expressions (REFE) is a key aspect of social cognition. Anxiety and mood disorders are associated with deficits in REFE, and anxiolytics and antidepressants reverse these deficits. Recent studies have shown that serotonergic hallucinogens (i.e. ayahuasca, dimethyltryptamine, psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide [LSD], and mescaline) have anxiolytic and antidepressant properties, but their effects on REFE are not well understood. The purpose of the study was to conduct a systematic review analyzing the effects of serotonergic hallucinogens on REFE in humans. METHODS: Studies published in the PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases until 19 October 2018 which analyzed the effects of serotonergic hallucinogens on REFE in humans were included. RESULTS: Of the 62 studies identified, 8 studies were included. Included studies involved the administration of a single or a few doses of LSD or psilocybin, and most trials were randomized and controlled with placebo. LSD and psilocybin reduced the recognition of negative emotions in most studies and modulated amygdala activity to these stimuli, which was correlated with antidepressive effects in patients. Both drugs were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Serotonergic hallucinogens reduced the recognition of negative emotions by modulating amygdala activity. Despite the small sample sizes, results suggest that serotonergic hallucinogens show promising beneficial effects on deficits in REFE.","[0, 1, 1, 0]"

One hundred and fifty consecutive patients, presenting to the Padova (Italy) Addiction Treatment Unit and who had taken ecstasy on at least one occasion, were examined and studied using a semi-structured interview. Ninety-five percent of the patients had experimented with another drug of abuse at least once in their lifetime. Ecstasy was mainly self-administered at disco clubs, and reported acute psychoactive effects confirmed previous reports. Fifty-three percent of the total sample were found to be affected by one or more psychopathological problems; the most frequent were depression, psychotic disorders, cognitive disturbances, bulimic episodes, impulse control disorders, panic disorders, social phobia. Those who were free from any psychopathological problem, compared to the others, had taken a smaller number of MDMA tablets in their lifetime, for a shorter duration and with a lower frequency. Again, they were less likely to have used alcohol together with ecstasy but more likely to have used opiates. Longer-term, larger dosage (acute or cumulative) MDMA consumers were found to be at high risk of developing psychopathological disturbances. The results are discussed, taking into account both the ecstasy suggested serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) neurotoxicity and the various methodological issues pertaining to this kind of large-scale clinical study describing people for whom MDMA is far from being the only drug of abuse.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"7752","Comparative Effects of Methylphenidate, Modafinil, and MDMA on Response Inhibition Neural Networks in Healthy Subjects.^\nBACKGROUND: Psychostimulants such as methylphenidate and modafinil are increasingly used by healthy people for cognitive enhancement purposes, whereas the acute effect of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy) on cognitive functioning in healthy subjects remains unclear. This study directly compared the acute effects of methylphenidate, modafinil, and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine on the neural mechanisms underlying response inhibition in healthy subjects. METHODS: Using a double-blind, within-subject, placebo-controlled, cross-over design, methylphenidate, modafinil, and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine were administrated to 21 healthy subjects while performing a go/no-go event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging task to assess brain activation during motor response inhibition. RESULTS: Relative to placebo, methylphenidate and modafinil but not 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine improved inhibitory performance. Methylphenidate significantly increased activation in the right middle frontal gyrus, middle/superior temporal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, presupplementary motor area, and anterior cingulate cortex compared with placebo. Methylphenidate also induced significantly higher activation in the anterior cingulate cortex and presupplementary motor area and relative to modafinil. Relative to placebo, modafinil significantly increased activation in the right middle frontal gyrus and superior/inferior parietal lobule, while 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine significantly increased activation in the right middle/inferior frontal gyrus and superior parietal lobule. CONCLUSIONS: Direct comparison of methylphenidate, modafinil, and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine revealed broad recruitment of fronto-parietal regions but specific effects of methylphenidate on middle/superior temporal gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex, and presupplementary motor area activation, suggesting dissociable modulations of response inhibition networks and potentially the superiority of methylphenidate in the enhancement of cognitive performance in healthy subjects.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"7904","Modulatory effects of ketamine, risperidone and lamotrigine on resting brain perfusion in healthy human subjects.^\nRationale: Resting brain perfusion, measured using the MRI-based arterial spin labelling (ASL) technique, is sensitive to detect central effects of single, clinically effective, doses of pharmacological compounds. However, pharmacological interaction experiments, such as the modulation of one drug response in the presence of another, have not been widely investigated using a task-free ASL approach. Objectives: We assessed the effects of three psychoactive compounds (ketamine, risperidone and lamotrigine), and their interaction, on resting brain perfusion in healthy human volunteers. Methods: A multivariate Gaussian process classification (GPC) and more conventional univariate analyses were applied. The four pre-infusion conditions for each subject comprised risperidone, lamotrigine and two placebo sessions. The two placebo conditions enabled us to evaluate the classification performance in a test-retest setting, in addition to its performance in distinguishing the active oral drugs from placebo (direct effect on brain perfusion). The post ketamine- or saline-infusion scans allowed the effect of ketamine, and its interaction with risperidone and lamotrigine, on brain perfusion to be characterised. Results: The pseudo-continuous ASL measurements of perfusion were sensitive to the effects of ketamine infusion and risperidone. The GPC captured consistent changes in perfusion across the group and contextualised the univariate changes with a larger pattern of regions contributing to accurate discrimination of ketamine from placebo. Conclusions: The findings argue against perfusion changes confounding in the previously described evoked BOLD response to ketamine and emphasise the blockade of the NMDA receptor over neuronal glutamate release in determining the perfusion changes induced by ketamine.

"7942","Neurocognitive performance of repeated versus single intravenous subanesthetic ketamine in treatment resistant depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine demonstrated rapid antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). However, evaluation of ketamine's neurocognitive effect in TRD is unclear. We aim to (1) characterize baseline neurocognitive performance as a predictor of the change in severity of depressive symptoms over time, and (2) investigate the association of six versus single intravenous (IV) ketamine and neurocognitive changes from baseline to the end of treatment. METHODS: Subjects with TRD were randomized to receive either five IV midazolam followed by a single IV ketamine or six IV ketamine during a 12-day period. Depression symptom assessments occurred prior and 24 h after infusion days using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale. Neurocognitive tasks were designed to test attention, memory, speed of processing, and set shifting using the CogState battery at baseline and at the end of treatment. RESULTS: Better complex working memory at baseline predicted improvement in MADRS scores of ketamine (vs midazolam) after 5 infusions. Most, but not all, neurocognitive functions remained stable or improved after repeated or single ketamine. There was a greater differential effect of treatment on speed of processing, set shifting, and spatial working memory that favors subjects in the six ketamine group. These cognitive improvements from baseline to the end of treatment were robust when controlling for age and changes in depression severity. CONCLUSION: The study suggests that six IV ketamine compared to single IV ketamine has a mood independent procognitive effect among TRD patients. Large scale studies are needed to confirm whether ketamine enhances cognitive function in TRD.","[0, 1, 0, 0]"
"8029","Association between Lifetime Classic Psychedelic Use and Hypertension in the Past Year.^\nUsing data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2005-2014), weighted to be representative of the US adult population, the present study investigated the association between lifetime classic psychedelic use and hypertension in the past year among adults in the United States. The results showed that respondents who reported having used a classic psychedelic at least once in their lifetime had significantly lower odds of hypertension in the past year after adjusting for several potential confounders (adjusted odds ratio, 0.86 [0.81-0.91]; P<0.0001). Notably, when analyzing the associations between hypertension in the past year and lifetime use of the main classes of classic psychedelics, namely tryptamines (N,N-dimethyltryptamine, ayahuasca, and psilocybin), lysergic acid diethylamide (a lysergamide), and phenethylamines (mescaline, peyote, and San Pedro), only the association with lifetime tryptamine use was significant (adjusted odds ratio, 0.80 [0.73-0.89]; P=0.0001). Though these associations are novel, rigorous randomized controlled trials are warranted to investigate potential causal pathways of classic psychedelics on blood pressure.","[0, 0, 0, 1]"
"8749","Change in patient-centered outcomes of psychological well-being, sleep, and suicidality following treatment with intravenous ketamine for late-life treatment-resistant depression.^\nOBJECTIVE: To examine whether psychological well-being, sleep, and suicidality improved with treatment with intravenous (IV) ketamine for late-life treatment-resistant depression (TRD). METHODS: This is an analysis of secondary outcomes in an open-label late-life TRD study examining the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of IV ketamine infusions. In the acute phase, participants (N = 25) aged 60 years or older received twice-a-week IV ketamine for 4 weeks. Then, participants with Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score <10 or ≥ 30% reduction from baseline proceeded to the continuation phase, an additional four weeks of once-a-week IV ketamine. The secondary outcomes analyzed here are based on the National Institute of Health Toolbox Psychological Well-Being subscales for Positive Affect and General Life Satisfaction, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and the Scale for Suicidal Ideation. RESULTS: Psychological well-being, sleep, and suicidality improved during the acute phase and those improvements were sustained during the continuation phase. Greater improvements in measures of psychological well-being and sleep were seen in participants who had greater improvements in MADRS scores and moved onto the continuation phase. All but one of the few participants with high suicidality at baseline improved; there were no cases of treatment-emergent suicidality. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological well-being, sleep, and suicidality improved in participants with late-life TRD who received IV ketamine for 8 weeks. A future larger and longer controlled trial is needed to confirm and extend these findings. REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04504175.","[0, 1, 0, 0]"
"8810","Quitting ecstasy: An investigation of why people stop taking the drug and their subsequent mental health.^\nThe regular use of ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA) has been associated with depressed mood, anxiety and hostility, but it is not known whether such effects persist after people stop using the drug. Furthermore, little is known about what factors might influence the decision to quit using MDMA. The aim of the present study was to examine the reasons why ex-users had stopped using this drug and to assess their current levels of depression, anxiety, anger and aggression. Telephone interviews were conducted with people who used to take MDMA on a regular basis but who no longer used the drug. The participants comprised sixty-six ex-users who used to take MDMA regularly (at least once every 2 months over a period of at least 1 year), but who had not taken MDMA for at least 1 year (average 3 years). Participants were asked about why they had quit MDMA. They also completed questionnaires to assess trait mood. Ex-users could be divided into two groups based on their reason for quitting: (i) those who had quit for mental health reasons and (ii) those who had quit for circumstantial reasons. Approximately half of those in the mental health group scored in the range for clinical depression. In that group, current levels of depression and anxiety correlated significantly with the cumulative amount of MDMA that they had taken several years previously. These findings suggest that some users may either be more vulnerable to the adverse effects of MDMA or have pre-existing mental health problems for which they self-medicate by using ecstasy. The present study shows that some ex-users experience an impairment to mental health that persists for years after they stop using this drug.","[0, 1, 0, 0]"
"8836","Efficacy and Safety of a Rapid Intravenous Injection of Ketamine 0.5 mg/kg in Treatment-Resistant Major Depression: An Open 4-Week Longitudinal Study.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine has been documented for its rapid antidepressant effects. However, optimal dose and delivery route have not yet been thoroughly investigated. The objectives of this study were to document the safety and test the antidepressant and antisuicidal effects of a single rapid 1-minute injection of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). METHODS: Ten patients with TRD were included in an open, noncontrolled 4-week study and received a rapid intravenous dose of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg. Main outcome measure was the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale and suicidality was assessed using the Scale for Suicide Ideation. RESULTS: Rapid injection of ketamine elicited transient increase of blood pressure and altered states of consciousness in all patients and mild psychotomimetic effects in 4 patients, which all resolved without any intervention. Decrease of depression severity was observed from 40-minute postinjection until day 15. Eight patients became responders within 1 day and all were nonresponders after 4 weeks. The decrease of suicidal ideation was significant until day 7. Analysis indicated that higher severity of depression and anxiety at baseline predicted a larger Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale decrease after 4 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that in well-controlled medical settings with adequate monitoring, a single rapid 1-minute injection of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg can be well tolerated and is efficacious in rapidly reducing depression symptoms and suicidal thoughts in outpatients with TRD. These findings are relevant to the practice of general clinical psychiatry and emergency departments were ketamine can have a place in acute management of TRD. Larger studies are necessary to confirm these results.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"8972","Use of plant-based hallucinogens and dissociative agents: U.S. Time Trends, 2002–2019.^\nAims: Information on time trends in use of different plant-based hallucinogens is lacking. The current study used nationally representative U.S. data to assess overall and age-specific time trends in the prevalence of lifetime and 12-month use of plant-based hallucinogens and dissociative agents. Methods: Participants were respondents aged ≥ 12 years (N = 1,006,051) from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2002–2019. Predictors were continuous years. Outcomes included illicit use of peyote, mescaline, psilocybin, ketamine, salvia, and tryptamine. Sociodemographic variables (gender; age; race/ethnicity; educational level; family income) were modeled as covariates. Trends were estimated overall and by age (12–17, 18–25, 26+). Prevalence differences [PDs] were obtained for each category, along with 95 % confidence intervals [CI]. Results: Increases in lifetime use were observed for psilocybin (2002–2019 PD=+1.61), tryptamine (2006–2014 PD=+0.55; 2015–2019 PD=+0.44), and ketamine (2006–2014 PD=+0.27; 2015–2019 PD=+0.21). Mescaline use decreased (PD = −0.89). While overall lifetime salvia use increased between 2006 and 2014 (PD=+1.81), prevalence did not change between 2015 and 2019. Twelve-month use of tryptamine and ketamine increased between 2006 and 2014 (PD=+0.14; +0.03, respectively). Twelve-month ketamine use also increased from 2015 to 2019 (PD=+0.03). By age, participants aged 12–17 and 18–25 showed decreases in use of most types of hallucinogens, but those age 26+ generally showed increases. Conclusions: While use of plant-based hallucinogens and dissociative agents remains rare, lifetime use of ketamine, tryptamine, and psilocybin is increasing in adults. Considering these increases alongside concerns about unsupervised use of illicit products whose dose and composition is uncertain, clinicians and policymakers should remain mindful of the rising rates of illicit use in the general population.","[0, 0, 0, 1]"
"9057","The use of the psychological flexibility model to support psychedelic assisted therapy.^\nPsychedelic assisted therapy comprises three stages: Preparation, Psychedelic Session, and Integration. Preparation is key for maximising the potential of a beneficial psychedelic experience and integration is important for prolonging improvements. The psychological flexibility model (PFM) appears to be a promising one to guide psychedelic preparation and integration. This paper proposes a model that utilises the PFM as informed by a previously published qualitative study of patient accounts of change processes in psilocybin therapy that identified themes of acceptance and connection as associated with positive outcomes. This new model, the ACE (Accept, Connect, Embody) model presents the six psychological flexibility processes, renamed and rearranged in an acceptance triad (defusion, present moment focus, willingness) and a connection triad (self as context, values, committed action). This paper describes the ACE model and how it is being used in an ongoing trial of psilocybin treatment for major depression. It also describes qualitative evidence supportive of the idea that psychological flexibility may be key to characterizing the processes of change involved in psilocybin assisted therapy for depression. These and other results suggest that psilocybin may be specifically increasing psychological flexibility and point to the possibility that psychotherapy approaches incorporating the PFM may serve as a means to deepen and extend the benefits of psilocybin treatment, thus bridging the experiential gap between a potent inner experience and an outer life better lived.","[0, 0, 0, 1]"
"9151","LSD, afterglow and hangover: Increased episodic memory and verbal fluency, decreased cognitive flexibility.^\nPsychedelics acutely impair cognitive functions, but these impairments decline with growing experiences with psychedelics and microdoses may even exert opposing effects. Given the recent evidence that psychedelics induce neuroplasticity, this explorative study aimed at investigating the potential of psychedelics to sub-acutely change cognition. For this, we applied a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study with 24 healthy volunteers receiving 50 μg lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) or an inactive placebo. Sub-acute changes in cognition were measured 24 h after dosing, including memory (Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure, ROCF; 2D Object-Location Memory Task, OLMT; Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test, RAVLT), verbal fluency (phonological; semantic; switch), design fluency (basic; filter; switch), cognitive flexibility (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, WCST), sustained and switching attention (Trail Making Test, TMT), inhibitory control (Stroop Task) and perceptual reasoning (Block Design Test, BDT). The results show that when compared to placebo and corrected for Body Mass Index (BMI) and abstinence period from psychedelics, LSD sub-acutely improved visuospatial memory (ROCF immediate recall points and percentage, OLMT consolidation percentage) and phonological verbal fluency and impaired cognitive flexibility (WCST: fewer categories achieved; more perseveration, errors and conceptual level responses). In conclusion, the low dose of LSD moderately induced both ""afterglow"" and ""hangover"". The improvements in visuospatial memory and phonological fluency suggest that LSD-assisted therapy should be explored as a novel treatment perspective in conditions involving memory and language declines such as brain injury, stroke or dementia.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
