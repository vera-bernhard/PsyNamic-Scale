"3371","The effects of sub-anaesthetic doses of ketamine on memory, cognitive performance and subjective experience in healthy volunteers.^\nExamined cognitive and subjective effects of subanesthetic doses of ketamine on 12 healthy volunteers. Ss received 25 mg ketamine, 10 mg ketamine and saline placebo, intramuscular/ly (im) in a double-blind, Latin square design. A cognitive, perceptual and self-report test battery was administered over 45 min. The order of tests was rotated to control for timing effects. Ketamine (25 mg) significantly affected verbal learning and memory, parallel visual search, some measures of psychomotor performance, measures of arousal, subjective mood ratings and visual perception. Measures of attention and frontal lobe functioning were relatively unaffected. Thus, low doses of ketamine had selective, dose-related effects on memory, perceptual and psychomotor functions. The disruption of memory and perceptual processes may help to explain the unique subjective state induced by ketamine. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"4916","A single intravenous administration of a sub-anesthetic ketamine dose during the perioperative period of cesarean section for preventing postpartum depression: A meta-analysis.^\nThe feasibility of intravenous ketamine administration during the perioperative period of cesarean section to prevent postpartum depression (PPD) has not been determined by meta-analysis. To evaluate the efficacy, safety and dose of prophylactic ketamine in offsetting PPD, we retrieved the following databases in English or Chinese from inception to December 2020: Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, CNKI, VIP and Wanfang. A total of 10 studies (9 RCTs and 1 retrospective study) were included with 2087 cases. Meta-analysis showed that in ketamine group, the score and the prevalence of PPD within 1 week postpartum were significantly reduced, whereas PPD score after 4 weeks postpartum showed no superiority. There was no significant difference in terms of total adverse events rate, although vomiting occurred more frequently in the ketamine group. In addition, we found that ketamine efficacy emerged at 0.5 mg/kg. By meta-regression, we observed that: (1) Age and BMI are negatively associated with mood response to ketamine. (2) An analgesic pump containing ketamine for continuous 48 h postpartum administration was more efficacious than an intravenous injection of ketamine during cesarean section. Current evidence shows ketamine could be efficacious and safe in the prophylactic management of PPD in women having a cesarean section.","[0, 0, 0, 1]"
"6103","A Multi-Site Study of MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy for PTSD.^\nPTSD is a serious debilitating disorder that negatively impacts a person's daily life. PTSD is a stress‐related psychiatric condition that may occur following a traumatic event such as war, disaster, sexual abuse, violence, terrorism, and accidents. PTSD negatively impacts a person's daily life, resulting in relationship difficulties, difficulty in finding and maintaining a job, reduced cognitive and psychosocial functioning, substance abuse, high‐cost healthcare use, and increased depression and suicide risk. Available PTSD treatments, including medications and therapy, effectively treat only a fraction of people who try them for adequate dose and duration. People with PTSD can be treated with psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies. In the past decade, there has been a growing amount of research into medications and other methods that may augment the effectiveness of psychotherapy for PTSD 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a drug that releases serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain and indirectly increases levels of the neurohormones oxytocin, arginine vasopressin and cortisol. The combined neurobiological effects of MDMA increase compassion, reduce defenses and fear of emotional injury, and enhance communication and introspection. MDMA produces anxiolytic and prosocial effects, which counteract avoidance and hyperarousal in the context of therapy. A combined treatment of MDMA and psychotherapy may be especially useful for treating PTSD. This multi‐site, double‐blind, randomized Phase 3 study assesses the efficacy and safety of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy versus psychotherapy with placebo control in participants diagnosed with at least severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The study will be conducted in N ≈ 100 participants. Participants will be enrolled in one of two groups at a 1:1 ratio. A flexible dose of MDMA or placebo, followed by a supplemental half‐dose unless contraindicated, is administered during the Treatment Period with manualized psychotherapy in three monthly Experimental Sessions. This 12‐week Treatment Period is preceded by three Preparatory Sessions. During the Treatment Period, each Experimental Session is followed by three Integrative Sessions of non‐drug psychotherapy. The Primary Outcome measure is change in Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM 5 (CAPS‐5) from Baseline. Exploratory measures will address specific symptoms, or behavior that is sometimes related to PTSD. Drug safety will be assessed by measuring blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature during experimental sessions, collecting adverse events and measuring suicidal thoughts or behaviors with the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS). This study will compare the effects of three manualized Experimental Sessions of psychotherapy supported by assisted by flexible doses of MDMA versus placebo. Initial doses per Experimental Session include 80 mg or 120 mg of MDMA compounded with mannitol and magnesium stearate or placebo alone (mannitol and magnesium stearate), followed 1.5 to 2 hours later by a supplemental half‐dose (40 or 60 mg).

"8606","Anxiolytic effects of acute and maintenance ketamine, as assessed by the Fear Questionnaire subscales and the Spielberger State Anxiety Rating Scale.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine has rapid anxiolytic effects in treatment-resistant obsessive compulsive, post-traumatic stress, generalised anxiety and social anxiety disorders. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess changes following acute and maintenance ketamine therapy on the Fear Questionnaire (FQ) subscales and the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory (SSAI). METHODS: This secondary analysis used data from a mixed open-label and double-blinded placebo-controlled study. A total of 24 patients received short-term ascending subcutaneous doses of ketamine and were then eligible to enter a 3-month maintenance phase of 1 mg/kg ketamine dosed once or twice weekly. FQ and SSAI data were analysed using mixed models to identify between-dose differences and to describe trends during maintenance. RESULTS: Acute ketamine dosing showed a rapid dose-related reduction in all three FQ subscales (agoraphobia, social phobia and blood-injury phobia) and in the SSAI. A progressive decrease in pre-dose rating-scale scores was evident during the 3 months of maintenance therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine demonstrated dose-related improvements in all FQ subscales and in the SSAI. Both scales appear to be suitable tools to assess the anxiolytic effects of ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant anxiety. Furthermore, ketamine appears to have broad, dose-related anti-phobic effects. These findings raise the possibility that ketamine may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of other phobic states, such as specific phobia.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"254","Efficacy and safety of ketamine in bipolar depression: A systematic review.^\nThe depression is the most prevalent state throughout the life of the bipolar patient. Ketamine has been shown to be an effective and rapid treatment for depression. The objective of the present work is to perform a systematic review on the efficacy and safety of ketamine as treatment of bipolar depression, as well as its different patterns of administration. The search found 10 relevant manuscripts that met the inclusion criteria: one clinical trial, 5 cohort studies, and 4 case reports. Intravenous infusion was used in 60% of the studies. According to data, ketamine seems to be an effective and safe treatment for bipolar depression, although the length of its effect is short. Adverse effects observed generally occurred at the time of infusion, and tended to completely disappear within 1-2h. Therefore, more studies are necessary to explore new patterns of administration, as well as on its safety and adverse effects.","[0, 0, 0, 1]"
"748","Assessing the risk-benefit profile of classical psychedelics: a clinical review of second-wave psychedelic research.^\nRATIONALE: A broad reassessment of the potential benefits of psychedelic drugs has led to the initiation of multiple major clinical trials in an effort to advance their status to become FDA-approved medications, as well as local legislative efforts to legalize or decriminalize their use. OBJECTIVES: To use recently published data to assess potential risks and benefits of psychedelic drugs as therapeutics, as well as to synthesize what is currently known in order to generate fruitful future research directions. METHODS: A review of studies conducted since 1991 identified 14 clinical trials of classical psychedelics, including 11 of psilocybin (N = 257 participants), 1 of lysergic acid diethylamide (N = 12 participants), and 2 of ayahuasca (N = 46 participants). Other published studies (e.g., of healthy volunteers, survey studies, case reports, neuroimaging) were also considered for review. RESULTS: Published studies since 1991 largely support the hypothesis that small numbers of treatments with psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy can offer significant and sustained alleviation to symptoms of multiple psychiatric conditions. No serious adverse events attributed to psychedelic therapy have been reported. Existing studies have several limitations, including small sample sizes, inherent difficulty in blinding, relatively limited follow-up, and highly screened treatment populations. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial data have been gathered in the past 30 years suggesting that psychedelics are a potent treatment for a variety of common psychiatric conditions, though the ideal means of employing these substances to minimize adverse events and maximize therapeutic effects remains controversial. Unique factors related to study design are vital for clinical researchers in the field to address.","[0, 0, 0, 1]"
"1825","Selective augmentation of striatal functional connectivity following NMDA receptor antagonism: Implications for psychosis.^\nThe psychotomimetic effect of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist ketamine is thought to arise from a functional modulation of the brain's fronto-striato-thalamic (FST) circuits. Animal models suggest a pronounced effect on ventral 'limbic' FST systems, although recent work in patients with psychosis and high-risk individuals suggests specific alterations of dorsal 'associative' FST circuits. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the effects of a subanesthetic dose of ketamine on measures of functional connectivity as indexed by the temporal coherence of spontaneous neural activity in both dorsal and ventral FST circuits, as well as their symptom correlates. We adopted a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, repeated-measures design in which 19 healthy participants received either an intravenous saline infusion or a racemic mixture of ketamine (100 ng/ml) separated by at least I week Compared with placebo, ketamine increased functional connectivity between the dorsal caudate and both the thalamus and midbrain bilaterally. Ketamine additionally increased functional connectivity of the ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Both connectivity increases significantly correlated with the psychosis-like and dissociative symptoms under ketamine. Importantly, dorsal caudate connectivity with the ventrolateral thalamus and subthalamic nucleus showed inverse correlation with ketamine-induced symptomatology, pointing to a possible resilience role to disturbances in FST circuits. Although consistent with the role of FST in mediating psychosis, these findings contrast with previous research in clinical samples by suggesting that acute NMDAR antagonism may lead to psychosis-like experiences via a mechanism that is distinct from that implicated in frank psychotic illness.

"1829","Reduction in social anxiety after MDMA-assisted psychotherapy with autistic adults: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study.^\nRATIONALE: Standard therapeutic approaches to reduce social anxiety in autistic adults have limited effectiveness. Since 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy shows promise as a treatment for other anxiety disorders, a blinded, placebo-controlled pilot study was conducted. OBJECTIVES: To explore feasibility and safety of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for reduction of social fear and avoidance that are common in the autistic population. METHODS: Autistic adults with marked to very severe social anxiety were randomized to receive MDMA (75 to 125 mg, n = 8) or inactive placebo (0 mg, n = 4) during two 8-h psychotherapy sessions (experimental sessions) in a controlled clinical setting. Double-blinded experimental sessions were spaced approximately 1 month apart with 3 non-drug psychotherapy sessions following each. The primary outcome was change in Leibowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) Total scores from Baseline to one month after the second experimental session. Outcomes were measured again six months after the last experimental session. RESULTS: Improvement in LSAS scores from baseline to the primary endpoint was significantly greater for MDMA group compared to the placebo group (P = 0.037), and placebo-subtracted Cohen's d effect size was very large (d = 1.4, CI - 0.074, 2.874). Change in LSAS scores from baseline to 6-month follow-up showed similar positive results (P = 0.036), with a Cohen's d effect size of 1.1 (CI - 0.307, 2.527). Social anxiety remained the same or continued to improve slightly for most participants in the MDMA group after completing the active treatment phase. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot trial demonstrated rapid and durable improvement in social anxiety symptoms in autistic adults following MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. Initial safety and efficacy outcomes support expansion of research into larger samples to further investigate this novel treatment for social anxiety.

METHODS: Post hoc analysis of endocannabinoid plasma levels (baseline, 90 and 240 min after drug intake) from two parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled trials. In Study 1, 20 healthy volunteers ingested ayahuasca (average 1.58 mg/ml dimethyltryptamine (DMT)) or placebo, and in Study 2, 17 volunteers with SAD received ayahuasca (average 0.680 mg/ml DMT) or placebo. RESULTS: A significant difference was observed in AEA concentrations in Study 2 after ayahuasca intake (Χ(2) (2) = 6.5, p = 0.03, Friedman test), and near significant differences (increases) were observed between baseline and 90 (Z = 0, p = 0.06, Wilcoxon test) and 240 (Z = 10, p = 0.06) minutes after ayahuasca intake. CONCLUSIONS: Although our findings suggest that ayahuasca could modulate AEA levels in SAD patients, the high interindividual variability in both trials and the small samples preclude definitive conclusions. More research with larger samples is needed to better understand the effects of ayahuasca and other hallucinogens in the endocannabinoid system.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"3631","Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Oral Psilocybin Administration in Healthy Participants.^\nPsilocybin is being investigated as a potential treatment for psychiatric and neurological disorders. Only a few studies have evaluated the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of psilocybin and have used body weight-adjusted dosing. Data on PKs and the PK-pharmacodynamic (PD) relationship of fixed doses that are commonly used are unavailable. The present study characterized the PKs and PK-PD relationship of 15, 25, and 30 mg of orally administered psilocybin in 28, 23, and 28 healthy subjects, respectively. Plasma levels of unconjugated psilocin (the psychoactive metabolite of psilocybin) and corresponding subjective effects were repeatedly assessed up to 24 hours. PK parameters were determined using compartmental modeling. Concentration-subjective effect relationships were described using PK-PD modeling. Mean (95% confidence interval) maximal psilocin concentrations were 11 ng/mL (10-13), 17 ng/mL (16-19), and 21 ng/mL (19-24) after the administration of 15, 25, and 30 mg psilocybin, respectively. Maximal concentrations were reached after an average of 2 hours. Elimination half-lives were 1.8 hours (1.7-2.0), 1.4 hours (1.2-1.7), and 1.8 hours (1.6-1.9) for 15, 25, and 30 mg psilocybin, respectively. Mean (± SD) durations of subjective effects were 5.6 ± 2.2 hours, 5.5 ± 1.6 hours, and 6.4 ± 2.2 hours, and maximal effects (""any drug"" effects) were 58% ± 25%, 73% ± 27%, and 80% ± 18% after 15, 25, and 30 mg psilocybin, respectively. Psilocin exhibited dose-proportional PKs. The duration and intensity of subjective effects were dose-dependent. Body weight did not influence pharmacokinetics or the response to psilocybin.

"4969","The serotonin uptake inhibitor citalopram reduces acute cardiovascular and vegetative effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine ('Ecstasy') in healthy volunteers.^\nMDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) or 'Ecstasy' is a widely used recreational drug that produces a state of heightened mood but also cardiovascular and vegetative side-effects. In animals, MDMA releases serotonin and, to a lesser extent, dopamine and norepinephrine. The release of serotonin can be blocked by serotonin uptake inhibitors such as citalopram. It is unknown to what extent this mechanism is also responsible for the physiological side-effects of MDMA seen in humans. We investigated the effect of citalopram pretreatment (40 mg i.v.) on vegetative and cardiovascular effects of MDMA (1.5 mg/kg p.o.) in a double-blind placebo-controlled study in 16 healthy volunteers. MDMA moderately increased blood pressure and heart rate, slightly elevated body temperature and produced a broad range of acute and short-term side-effects. Citalopram reduced all these MDMA-induced physiological changes except for body temperature. These findings suggest that physiological effects of MDMA in humans are partially due to an interaction of MDMA with the serotonin carrier and a subsequent release of serotonin.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"6954","Adjunct Ketamine Use in the Management of Severe Ethanol Withdrawal.^\nOBJECTIVES: Ketamine offers a plausible mechanism with favorable kinetics in treatment of severe ethanol withdrawal. The purpose of this study is to determine if a treatment guideline using an adjunctive ketamine infusion improves outcomes in patients suffering from severe ethanol withdrawal. DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study. SETTING: Academic tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS: Patients admitted to the ICU and diagnosed with delirium tremens by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders V criteria. INTERVENTIONS: Pre and post guideline, all patients were treated in a symptom-triggered fashion with benzodiazepines and/or phenobarbital. Postguideline, standard symptom-triggered dosing continued as preguideline, plus, the patient was initiated on an IV ketamine infusion at 0.15-0.3 mg/kg/hr continuously until delirium resolved. Based upon withdrawal severity and degree of agitation, a ketamine bolus (0.3 mg/kg) was provided prior to continuous infusion in some patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 63 patients were included (29 preguideline; 34 postguideline). Patients treated with ketamine were less likely to be intubated (odds ratio, 0.14; p < 0.01; 95% CI, 0.04-0.49) and had a decreased ICU stay by 2.83 days (95% CI, -5.58 to -0.089; p = 0.043). For ICU days outcome, correlation coefficients were significant for alcohol level and total benzodiazepine dosing. For hospital days outcome, correlation coefficients were significant for patient age, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase level. Regression revealed the use of ketamine was associated with a nonsignificant decrease in hospital stay by 3.66 days (95% CI, -8.40 to 1.08; p = 0.13). CONCLUSIONS: Mechanistically, adjunctive therapy with ketamine may attenuate the demonstrated neuroexcitatory contribution of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor stimulation in severe ethanol withdrawal, reduce the need for excessive gamma-aminobutyric acid agonist mediated-sedation, and limit associated morbidity. A ketamine infusion in patients with delirium tremens was associated with reduced gamma-aminobutyric acid agonist requirements, shorter ICU length of stay, lower likelihood of intubation, and a trend toward a shorter hospitalization.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"8611","Cytokine- and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-Related Gene-Based Genome-Wide Association Study of Low-Dose Ketamine Infusion in Patients with Treatment-Resistant Depression.^\nBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Ketamine may work as an anti-inflammatory agent, and it increases the levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in patients with treatment-resistant depression. However, whether genes related to pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and VEGF may predict the treatment response to ketamine remains unknown.Therefore the aim of this study was to analyze whether specific genes related to inflammatory processes and VEGF were associated with treatment response to low-dose ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant depression. METHODS: Based on the genome data from our clinical trial, this study was a secondary analysis of candidate genes correlated with different timepoints of depressive symptoms. In total, 65 patients with treatment-resistant depression (n = 21 for ketamine 0.5 mg/kg, 20 for ketamine 0.2 mg/kg, and 24 for normal saline) were genotyped for 684,616 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Genes associated with 80 cytokines (i.e., interleukin [IL]-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and adiponectin) and VEGF (i.e., VEGF and VEGF receptors) were selected for the gene-based genome-wide association study on the antidepressant effect of a ketamine infusion. RESULTS: Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms, including rs2540315 and rs75746675 in IL1R1 and rs79568085 in VEGFC, were related to the rapid (within 240 min) antidepressant effect of a ketamine infusion; specific single nucleotide polymorphisms, such as Affx-20131665 in PIGF and rs8179353, rs8179353, and rs8179353 in TNFRSF8, were associated with the sustained (up to 2 weeks) antidepressant effect of low-dose (combined 0.5 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg) ketamine. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings further revealed that genes related to both anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, C-reactive protein, and adiponectin) and VEGF-FLK signaling predicted the treatment response to a ketamine infusion in patients with treatment-resistant depression.

"8706","The effects of low dose ketamine on sensory gating, neuroendocrine secretion and behavior in healthy human subjects.^\nRecently, much interest has been given to the role of glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDA) in sensory gating, such as prepulse inhibition (PPI) and reduction of the P50 evoked response potential (ERP). Currently, mainly animal data are available describing the role of NMDA receptors in these stimulus evaluation processes. Human data are virtually lacking and are potentially important, for instance for the understanding of sensory gating deficits observed in schizophrenia. Therefore, the effects of the NMDA antagonist ketamine, in a dose of 0.3 mg/kg i.v., on concurrent assessment of PPI and P50 reduction was studied in 18 healthy male volunteers. Ketamine was administered in a pseudo-steady state model with a subacute loading dose. In addition, the effects of ketamine on behavior, vital signs, homovanillic acid (HVA) plasma levels and secretion of cortisol and luteinizing hormone (LH) were also determined. Ketamine did not significantly alter PPI or the reduction of the P50 ERP. A small but significant increase in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total scores and BPRS composite scores ""thinking disorder"" and ""withdrawal/retardation"" was observed. Several subjects experienced visual perceptional alterations, but complex hallucinations did not occur. Ketamine induced mild analgesia and coordination problems. In addition, ketamine induced a marked rise in cortisol secretion, while LH secretion was not affected. Finally, systolic and diastolic, blood pressure and heart rate increased during ketamine infusion. Although in humans NMDA receptors may not be involved in the regulation of PPI and P50 reduction, the most likely explanation for the lack of effect of ketamine on these sensory gating paradigms is the dose used in this experiment. However, using a higher dose is hampered by the aspecificity of racemic ketamine. Future studies should use the enantiomer S-ketamine, which is more specific to NMDA receptors, to evaluate the involvement of NMDA receptors in these neurophysiological processes further.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"9572","Rapid and longer-term antidepressant effects of repeated-dose intravenous ketamine for patients with unipolar and bipolar depression.^\nObjective: Single-dose intravenous (IV) injection of ketamine has shown rapid but transient antidepressant effects. The strategy of repeated-dose ketamine infusions to maintain antidepressant effects has received little systematic study. This study was conducted to examine the efficacy and tolerability of six ketamine infusions in Chinese patients with unipolar and bipolar depression. Methods: Ninety seven patients with unipolar (n = 77) and bipolar (n = 20) depression received repeated ketamine infusions (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min) with continuous vital sign monitoring. Depressive symptoms were measured by the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Suicidal ideation was assessed using the Scale for Suicidal Ideations (SSI)-part 1. Anxiety symptoms were evaluated with the 14-item Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA). Adverse psychopathological and dissociative effects were assessed using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)-positive symptoms and Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS), respectively. Patients were assessed at baseline, 4 and 24 h, and 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 26 days. Results: After six ketamine infusions, the response and remission rates were 68.0% and 50.5%, respectively. There were significant decreases in MADRS, SSI-part 1, and HAMA scores within four hours following the first ketamine infusion, and the decreases were sustained over the subsequent infusion period. The nonresponder subgroup manifested rapid significant improvement in suicidal ideations throughout the course of treatment. After the six ketamine infusions, the response was positively associated with the response at 24 h after the first infusion (OR = 8.94), personal income ≥4000 yuan/month (OR = 3.04), and no history of psychiatric hospitalization (OR = 3.41). Only CADSS scores had a mild but marginally significant increase after the first infusion but with a significant BPRS score decrease.

However, there are only a few data with controversial results in the paediatric population. The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the use of low doses of intravenous ketamine on postoperative pain in children after surgery on the lower part of the body. METHODS: Thirty-seven children with ASA 1 or 2 from 6 to 60 months of age, undergoing scheduled surgery, were prospectively enrolled in a double blind sequential trial using a triangular test, with analysis every 10 patients treated. The children were randomly assigned to intravenously receive saline or 0.15 mg kg(-1) ketamine before surgery, followed by a continuous infusion of 1.4 microg kg(-1) min(-1) over 24 h. After sevoflurane induction and tracheal intubation, a caudal anaesthesia was performed in all children (1 ml kg(-1) of bupivacaine 0.25% with epinephrine). The postoperative analgesic technique was standardized with intravenous paracetamol 15 mg kg(-1) 6 h(-1), rectal morniflumate (20 mg kg(-1) 12 h(-1)) and intravenous nalbuphine infusion 1.2 mg kg(-1) 24 h(-1) for 24 h.

RESULTS: There was no difference in terms of additional bolus of nalbuphine as well as CHEOPS score area under the curve between groups, that is, 76 +/- 10 in the ketamine group versus 74 +/- 7 in the control group. No psychomimetic side effects were noted. CONCLUSION: The study failed to show any evidence of benefit of ketamine to improve analgesia in children when given in addition to a multimodal analgesic therapy with paracetamol, a NSAID and an opiate.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"6952","Stereochemical analysis of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine and its main metabolites in human samples including the catechol-type metabolite (3,4-dihydroxymethamphetamine).^\n3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ""ecstasy"") is a designer drug commonly misused in large segments of young populations. MDMA is usually formulated in tablets of its racemate (1:1 mixture of its enantiomers) in doses ranging from 50 to 200 mg. MDMA has an enantioselective metabolism, the (S)-enantiomer being metabolized faster than the (R)-enantiomer. Different pharmacologic properties have been attributed to each enantiomer. The carbon responsible for MDMA chirality is preserved along its metabolic disposition. An analytical method has been developed to determine MDMA enantiomers and those from its major metabolites, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 3,4-dihydroxymeth-amphetamine (HHMA), and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphet-amine (HMMA). It has been applied to the analysis of plasma and urine samples from healthy recreational users of MDMA who participated voluntarily in a clinical trial and received 100 mg (R,S)-MDMA. HCl orally. (R)/(S) ratios both in plasma (0-48 h) and urine (0-72 h) for MDMA and MDA were >1 and <1, respectively. Ratios corresponding to HHMA and HMMA, close to unity, deviate from theoretical expectations and are most likely explained by the ability of MDMA to autoinhibit its own metabolism. The short elimination half-life of (S)-MDMA (4.8 h) is consistent with the subjective effects and psychomotor performance reported in subjects exposed to MDMA, whereas the much longer half-life of the (R)-enantiomer (14.8 h) correlates with mood and cognitive effects experienced on the next days after MDMA use.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"

"221","Effects of ketamine anesthesia on efficacy, tolerability, seizure response, and neurocognitive outcomes in electroconvulsive therapy: A comprehensive meta-analysis of double-blind randomized controlled trials.^\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) remains the most effective treatment for major depressive disorder. Ketamine is an anesthetic gaining attention for its rapid antidepressant effect. Numerous randomized controlled trials have investigated the effect of ketamine anesthesia in ECT on various clinical outcomes. Previous systematic reviews have not found benefit for overall depression response, although some have found evidence of benefit early in the ECT course. Clear quantitative conclusions have not been established regarding other outcomes, particularly while only using data from high-quality studies. We aimed to examine all data from double-blind randomized controlled trials comparing ketamine to other anesthetics via meta-analysis, to make recommendations regarding ECT practice and future research. Data were extracted for depressive symptoms, seizure duration and electrical dose, neuropsychological performance, and adverse effects. Effect sizes were calculated using Hedge's g and odds ratios. Eighteen studies (n = 915) were included in the meta-analysis. Ketamine was not found to enhance improvement of depressive symptoms, either early in ECT course or at end of study. Ketamine had a large effect on increasing seizure duration both overall (Hedge's g = 0.71, P = 0.038) and in the subgroup receiving ketamine in combination with another anesthetic (Hedge's g = 0.78, P < 0.01), and on decreasing electrical dose (Hedge's g = 1.98, P = 0.039). There was no significant effect of ketamine on any individual neuropsychological domain. Ketamine was not associated with increased adverse effects, except for hypertension in patients receiving ketamine monotherapy. Significant heterogeneity was present for many outcomes, and sensitivity analyses suggested a relation to methodological variation in most cases. This study supports the finding that ketamine does not enhance ECT's antidepressant effect, including on early improvement, but provides substantial evidence for enhancing seizure duration and reducing electrical dose. No significant benefit was found on neurocognitive outcomes, but analysis was limited by small sample sizes and high heterogeneity. Ketamine is generally safe in ECT, particularly as a coanesthetic. Our findings provide meta-analytic support to the recommendations in ECT clinical guidelines for use of coadjuvant ketamine in ECT where seizures are suboptimal. Further studies targeting neurocognitive outcomes are encouraged. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","[0, 0, 0, 1]"
"692","Relationships between reduction in symptoms and restoration of function and wellbeing: Outcomes of the Oral Ketamine Trial on Suicidality (OKTOS).^\nRecovery of functioning is integral to successful treatment outcomes in depressive illness. Optimal antidepressant treatment results in both symptomatic remission and functional recovery. Oral ketamine rapidly reduces suicidality and depression; however, reports of functional and wellbeing outcomes are lacking. This study examines participants' social and occupational functioning and wellbeing outcomes in the Oral Ketamine Trial on Suicidality (OKTOS). Thirty adults with chronic suicidality participated in the trial over 10 weeks. Functional recovery and wellbeing were assessed using the Social and Occupational Functioning Scale (SOFAS) and World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5). Suicidality and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Beck Scale for Suicidal ideation (BSS) and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Relationships between the four treatment outcomes were analysed. Forty-three percent of participants achieved healthy function (SOFAS ≥ 80) and 27% reported healthy wellbeing (WHO-5 > 60%) at the four-week post-treatment follow-up. Wellbeing was revealed as the data-derived treatment endpoint for the sample. Effect sizes for functioning and wellbeing outcomes were smaller than for suicidality and depression outcomes. Results suggest that reduction in depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation may be necessary but not sufficient for full restoration of function and wellbeing in antisuicidal and antidepressant therapy, including clinical trials.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"1037","Alcohol use and risk taking among regular ecstasy users.^\nWe examine alcohol use in conjunction with ecstasy use and risk-taking behaviors among regular ecstasy users in every capital city in Australia. Data on drug use and risks were collected in 2004 from a national sample of 852 regular ecstasy users (persons who had used ecstasy at least monthly in the preceding 6 months). Users were grouped according to their typical alcohol use when using ecstasy: no use, consumption of between one and five standard drinks, and consumption of more than five drinks (""binge"" alcohol use). The sample was young, well educated, and mainly working or studying. Approximately two thirds (65%) of the regular ecstasy users reported drinking alcohol when taking ecstasy. Of these, 69% reported usually consuming more than five standard drinks. Those who did not drink alcohol were more disadvantaged, with greater levels of unemployment, less education, higher rates of drug user treatment, and prison history. They were also more likely than those who drank alcohol when using ecstasy to be drug injectors and to be hepatitis C positive. Excluding alcohol, drug use patterns were similar between groups, although the no alcohol group used cannabis and methamphetamine more frequently. Binge drinkers were more likely to report having had three or more sexual partners in the past 6 months and were less likely to report having safe sex with casual partners while under the influence of drugs. Despite some evidence that the no alcohol group were more entrenched drug users, those who typically drank alcohol when taking ecstasy were as likely to report risks and problems associated with their drug use. It appears that regular ecstasy users who binge drink are placing themselves at increased sexual risk when under the influence of drugs. Safe sex messages should address the sexual risk associated with substance use and should be tailored to reducing alcohol consumption, particularly targeting ""heavy"" alcohol users. The study's limitations are noted. Copyright © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","[0, 1, 0, 0]"
"2033","Ketamine monotherapy versus adjunctive ketamine in adults with treatment-resistant depression: Results from the Canadian Rapid Treatment Centre of Excellence.^\nA proportion of individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) do not receive adequate therapeutic benefit from conventional monoaminergic antidepressant drugs, leading to treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Ketamine has been shown to provide rapid and significant efficacy in treating patients with TRD. The majority of published studies have investigated the adjunctive efficacy of ketamine with one or more monoaminergic antidepressants. There remains a clinical need to ascertain the relative effectiveness of ketamine monotherapy versus adjunctive ketamine treatment in adults with TRD. In this retrospective study, we investigate multidimensional, self-reported outcomes (i.e., antidepressant, anti-suicidality, antianxiety, and anti-functional impairment) of 220 patients to compare monotherapy (n = 39) and adjunctive (n = 181) ketamine treatment for TRD at a community-based clinic. Both groups had clinically and statistically significant antidepressant effects (p < 0.05). Individuals receiving ketamine monotherapy exhibited a significantly greater reduction on the suicidal ideation (SI) item of the Quick Inventory for Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report 16-Item (QIDS-SR(16)) than the adjunctive group, with a small effect size [F (1, 265) = 4.73; p = 0.03*; partial η(2) = 0.02], and a significantly higher proportion of partial responders at post-infusion 4 (p = 0.034*). No other between-group differences were significant. Limitations include the small sample, single-centred, open-label, non-randomized, uncontrolled, retrospective nature of this study and indication bias. Our real-world evidence suggests that ketamine may be effective as monotherapy or adjunct to monoamine-based treatments. A priority research and clinical vista is to identify subsets of individuals with TRD who are most likely to have a desired therapeutic outcome with monotherapy versus adjunctive ketamine treatment.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"2035","Ketamine infusions for treatment resistant depression: a series of 28 patients treated weekly or twice weekly in an ECT clinic.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine has a rapid antidepressant effect in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The effects on cognitive function of multiple ketamine infusions and of concurrent antidepressant medication on response rate and duration are not known. METHOD: Twenty-eight patients with uni- or bipolar TRD were treated over three weeks with either three or six ketamine infusions (0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes) in the recovery room of a routine ECT clinic. Post-treatment memory assessments were conducted on day 21 (4-7 days after the final infusion). Patients were followed up for six months where possible, with severity of depression and side effects monitored throughout. RESULTS: Eight (29%) patients responded of whom four remitted. Only three (11%) patients had responded within six hours after a single infusion, but in all responders, the response had developed before the third infusion. The duration of response from the final infusion was variable (median 70, range 25-168 days). Discontinuations included two (7%) because of acute adverse reactions during the infusion and five (18%) because of failure to benefit and increasing anxiety. Ketamine was not associated with memory impairment. The ECT clinic was rated suitable by patients and offered appropriate levels of monitoring. CONCLUSION: This small, open label naturalistic study shows that up to six low dose ketamine infusions can safely be given within an existing NHS clinical structure to patients who continue their antidepressants. The response rate was comparable to that found in RCTs of single doses of ketamine in antidepressant-free patients but took slightly longer to develop.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"

METHOD: We administered a self-report questionnaire to 210 respondents. For various licit and illicit substances, participants reported their age of first use, number of lifetime uses, and usage in the previous 30 days. RESULTS: We found a significant rank order for the sequence of first use: 1) alcohol, 2) nicotine, 3) cannabis, 4) LSD, 5) psilocybin, 6) amphetamine, 7) cocaine, 8) MDMA, 9) gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), 10) ephedrine, 11) ketamine. Alcohol and cannabis were the most commonly used substances, both in cumulative number of lifetime uses and in usage in the preceding 30 days. MDMA and amphetamine were also notable as the next 2 most popular drugs for use in the preceding 30 days and in terms of those who had tried the drugs at least once. We identified a progressive rank order of experimentation, with early alcohol or cannabis use (or both) associated with the early use of all other drugs tried by more than 25% of the sample.

"3956","Preliminary evidence of hippocampal dysfunction in adolescent MDMA (""ecstasy"") users: Possible relationship to neurotoxic effects.^\nRationale: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy) is a potent and selective serotonin neurotoxin whose use is growing among adolescents. Although cognitive deficits among adult MDMA users are well documented, little is known of the cognitive and brain functional sequelae of MDMA use during adolescence. Objective: We tested for evidence of cognitive deficits and changes in brain function in a pilot sample of adolescent MDMA users, who were compared with adolescent non-users of MDMA. Methods: Selective and divided attention and verbal working memory were examined in six adolescent MDMA users and six non- users of MDMA who were similar in age, gender, IQ, and other substance use. Brain function was assessed during performance of the working memory task using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Results: MDMA users had significantly prolonged reaction times during tests of selective and divided attention, and failed to deactivate the left hippocampus normally during high verbal working memory load. Conclusions: MDMA use in adolescence may be associated with cognitive impairments and dysfunction of inhibitory circuits within the hippocampus.

"4096","MDMA/ecstasy use and psilocybin use are associated with lowered odds of psychological distress and suicidal thoughts in a sample of US adults.^\nBackground: Suicide is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and rates within the United States have risen over the past two decades. Hence, there is a critical need for novel tools to treat suicidal ideation and related mental health conditions. 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)/ecstasy and classic psychedelics may be two such tools. Aims: The aim of this study was to assess non-causal associations between MDMA/ecstasy and classic psychedelic use and psychological distress and suicide risk. Methods: In this study, we examined the aforementioned associations among 484,732 adult participants in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2008–2019). Results: Lifetime MDMA/ecstasy use was associated with reduced odds of past year suicidal thinking (10% reduced odds; odds ratio (OR) = 0.90; 95% confidence interval, CI = (0.84–0.97); p < 0.01) and past year suicidal planning (OR = 0.88; 95% CI = (0.78–0.99); p < 0.05). Furthermore, lifetime psilocybin use was associated with reduced odds of past month psychological distress (OR = 0.78; 95% CI = (0.73–0.84); p < 0.001) and past year suicidal thinking (OR = 0.90; 95% CI = (0.83–0.96); p < 0.01). Finally, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) was associated with increased odds of past year suicidal thinking (OR = 1.07; 95% CI = (1.00–1.15); p < 0.05). Conclusion: MDMA/ecstasy and psilocybin use are associated with reduced odds of suicidal thinking and related outcomes—though experimental studies are needed to determine whether these associations are causal. These findings call for more research into the efficacy of MDMA/ecstasy and classic psychedelics for treating psychological distress and suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and for updated drug legislation that allows for further investigation into these substances.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"4356","MDMA: a social drug in a social context.^\nRATIONALE: The drug ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""ecstasy,"" ""molly"") is thought to produce prosocial effects and enhance social interaction. However, in most laboratory studies to date, the participants have been tested under nonsocial conditions, which may not simulate the effects the drug produces in more naturalistic social settings. METHODS: Healthy experienced MDMA users participated in three laboratory sessions in which they received MDMA (0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg or placebo, double blind). They were randomly assigned to one of three social conditions, in which they were tested alone (solitary (SOL); N = 10), in the presence of a research assistant (research assistant present (RAP); N = 11) or in the presence of another participant who also received the drug (other participant present (OPP); N = 11). RESULTS: As expected, MDMA increased heart rate and blood pressure and produced positive subjective effects in all the three groups. It also increased ratings of attractiveness of another person and increased social interaction in RAP and OPP. The social context affected certain responses to the drug. The effects of MDMA were greater in the OPP condition, compared to the SOL or RAP conditions, on measures of ""feel drug,"" ""dizzy,"" and on cardiovascular. But responses to the drug on other measures, including social behavior, did not differ across the conditions. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide some support for the idea that drugs produce greater effects when they are used in the presence of other drug users. However, the influence of the social context was modest, and it remains to be determined whether other variables related to social context would substantially alter the effects of MDMA or other drugs.","[0, 1, 0, 0]"
"4428","Cognitive performance after repeated administration of the NMDA positive allosteric modulator SAGE-718 in healthy volunteers.^\nBackground: NMDA receptor hypoactivity has been linked to a range of clinical phenomena, including cognitive dysfunction and alterations in social behavior. Potential treatments for conditions characterized by NMDA hypofunction may involve enhancement of NMDA receptor‐related neurotransmission. In a recent suite of target‐engagement studies, SAGE‐718, an investigational positive allosteric modulator of the NMDA receptor, demonstrated effects on electrophysiological and functional imaging biomarkers in healthy volunteers after a low dose ketamine challenge. These findings are consistent with CNS penetrance and functional engagement of the NMDA receptor. Here, the effects of 10‐day repeated exposure of SAGE‐718 on a core cognitive battery were investigated in healthy volunteers. Methods: Forty subjects were randomized (1:1) to either multiple oral doses of SAGE‐718 (n = 19) plus ketamine or placebo (n = 21) plus ketamine, which was delivered in a double‐blinded manner [SAGE‐718: n = 19, mean (SD) age 42.7 (12.00) years, 15.8% female; Placebo: n = 21, mean (SD) age 42.6 (11.56) years, 15.4% female]. SAGE‐718 oral solution or matching placebo solution was administered as a 1.0‐mg dose in a fasted condition once daily (between 7 and 10 AM) over the course of 10 days. Blood samples were taken and processed for pharmacokinetic analysis of concentrations of SAGE‐718. Plasma samples were used to calculate Cmax as well as other PK parameters. Computerized testing was used to measure performance on key cognitive domains, including attention, working memory, processing speed, executive function, and motor reaction time. Assessments included computerized versions of the International Shopping List Test (verbal learning), International Shopping List Test‐Delayed Recall (memory), Groton Maze Learning Test (executive function), Social Emotional Cognition Test (emotional cognition), Detection Test (psychomotor function), Identification Test (attention), One Back Test (working memory), Two Back Test (higher‐order working memory), Stop Signal Reaction Test (inhibition), and the Continuous Paired Associate Learning Test (paired associated learning). A mixed‐effect regression model analysis (MMRM) was applied, with change from baseline in each cognitive test score as the response variable, and treatment, visit, and visit‐by‐treatment interaction as fixed effects, baseline as a covariate, and measurements within the same subject as repeated measure. Unstructured covariance structure was applied for the repeated measure. Safety was assessed by adverse event reporting, standard clinical assessments, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, the Clinician Administered Dissociate State Scale, the Observers Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale, and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Results: As compared to placebo, statistically significant improvements were observed in the Two‐Back Test at days 2, 4 and 8 of testing (p < 0.05). Compared to placebo, statistically significant improvement was observed on the Groton Maze Test at day 6 of testing (p < 0.05). A dose‐response relationship was observed for the Two‐Back Test, with Cmax positively correlated with an increase in change from baseline performance on the Two‐Back Test (p = 0.02). A similar trend was observed for the Groton Maze Test (Cmax vs change from baseline, p = 0.06). SAGE‐718 was generally well tolerated with no serious adverse events or deaths observed in the trial subjects. The most frequent treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported after SAGE‐718 administration were mild and numerically similar to those seen with placebo (TEAE: SAGE‐718, n = 6 (31.6%); placebo, n = 7 (33.3%)). No TEAEs resulted in discontinuation or dose reduction of SAGE‐718. No significant changes in clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, or ECGS were observed. Conclusions: Healthy volunteers dosed with SAGE‐718 exhibited greater improvement on tests of higher‐order working memory (Two‐Back Test) and complex problem solving (Groton Maze Test), which at times reached the threshold for statistical significance as compared to subjects receiving placebo. SAGE‐718 was generally well tolerated by the trial subjects over 10 days of exposure. Improvements in executive performance, as reflected by significant improvements on the Two‐Back and Groton Maze Tests, suggest that further investigation of SAGE‐718 is warranted for the treatment of conditions characterized by states of relative NMDA hypofunction, particularly those manifesting with executive deficits.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"4639","Acute dose of MDMA (75 mg) impairs spatial memory for location but leaves contextual processing of visuospatial information unaffected.^\nRATIONALE: Research concerning spatial memory in 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) users has presented conflicting results showing either the presence or absence of spatial memory deficits. Two factors may have confounded results in abstinent users: memory task characteristics and polydrug use. OBJECTIVES: The present study aims to assess whether a single dose of MDMA affects spatial memory performance during intoxication and withdrawal phase and whether spatial memory performance after MDMA is task dependent. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen recreational MDMA users participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-way crossover design. They were treated with placebo, MDMA 75 mg, and methylphenidate 20 mg. Memory tests were conducted between 1.5 and 2 h (intoxication phase) and between 25.5 and 26 h (withdrawal phase) post-dosing. Two spatial memory tasks of varying complexity were used that required either storage of stimulus location alone (spatial memory task) or memory for location as well as processing of content or contextual information (change blindness task). RESULTS: After a single dose of MDMA, the subjects made larger localization errors and responded faster compared to placebo in the simple spatial memory task during intoxication phase. Inaccuracy was not due to increased response speed, as determined by regression analysis. Performance in the change blindness task was not affected by MDMA. Methylphenidate did not affect performance on any of the tasks. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that a single dose of MDMA impairs spatial memory for location but leaves processing of contextual information intact.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"5628","An encounter with the self: A thematic and content analysis of the DMT experience from a naturalistic field study.^\nINTRODUCTION: N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is an endogenous serotonergic psychedelic capable of producing radical shifts in an experience that have significant implications for consciousness and its neural correlates, especially given the ""disconnected consciousness"" suggested by the ""breakthrough"" DMT state. Its increasing usage and clinical trial indicate the growing importance of a thorough elucidation of the experience's qualitative content, over and above the phenomenological structure. This is particularly in light of the intensely pervasive effects of DMT occasions in all dimensions of the self, which are often ontologically challenging yet potentially transformative. METHODS: This is the second report on the first naturalistic field study of DMT use exploring its qualitative analysis. Screened, healthy, anonymized, and experienced DMT users were observed during their non-clinical use of the drug at home (40-75-mg inhaled). In-depth semi-structured interviews, inspired by the micro-phenomenological technique, were employed immediately after their experience. This study reports on the thematic and content analysis of one major domain of the breakthrough experiences elicited, the ""self""; where analyses of the ""other"" were previously reported. A total of 36 post-DMT experience interviews with mostly Caucasian (83%) men (eight women) of a mean of 37 years were predominantly inductively coded. RESULTS: Invariably, profound and highly intense experiences occurred. The first overarching category comprised the onset of effects, encompassing super-ordinate themes including sensory, emotion and body, and space-time shifts; the second category comprised bodily effects, encompassing themes including pleasurable, neutral/both, and uncomfortable; the third category comprised the sensorial effects, encompassing open-eye, visual, and cross-modal and other; the fourth comprised the psychological effects, encompassing memory and language, awareness and sense of self, and time distortions; and the fifth comprised the emotional effects, encompassing positive, neither/both, and challenging experiences. Many further subthemes also illuminate the rich content of the DMT experience. DISCUSSION: The present study provides a systematic and nuanced analysis of the content of the breakthrough DMT state pertaining to one's personal and self-referential experiences of the body, senses, psychology, and emotions. The resonances both with previous DMT studies and other types of extraordinary experiences, such as the alien abduction, shamanic and near-death experiences, are also elaborated upon. Putative neural mechanisms and their promise as a psychotherapeutic agent, especially owing to deep emotional impact, are discussed.","[0, 1, 0, 0]"
"6003","Randomized Placebo-controlled Study of MDMA-assisted Psychotherapy in People With PTSD - Israel.^\nPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) occurs after experiencing a traumatic event or events. PTSD is a public health problem that causes a great deal of suffering. This study will examine whether two six to eight‐hour long sessions of 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)‐assisted psychotherapy scheduled three to five weeks apart are safe, and whether combining a fully therapeutic dose of MDMA with psychotherapy, compared with a low (""active placebo"") dose of MDMA, will reduce PTSD symptoms, with symptoms measured four times, twice during the study, and during two follow‐up assessments six and twelve months after the second experimental session. People who received the active placebo dose of MDMA can then take part in an ""open label"" study continuation, with the participant receiving a fully active dose of MDMA on two more six to eight hour‐long psychotherapy sessions. Open‐label means that the participants and the researchers know that the participant will receive the fully active dose of MDMA. People who receive the full dose of MDMA, and anyone who received low‐dose MDMA and does not undergo the open‐label study continuation will have PTSD symptoms measured six and twelve months after the second fully active or low dose MDMA session. People who take part in the open label study continuation have their PTSD symptoms checked six and 12 months after the second open label MDMA‐assisted session. MDMA is a substance that has unique effects that make it well suited to intensive psychotherapy. MDMA may belong to a new class of drugs, called entactogens, that produce feelings of closeness to others, empathy, well being, and insightfulness. Currently, MDMA is scheduled in the US and Israel, and doctors and therapists cannot give it to people outside of research studies like this one. Anecdotal reports of therapy conducted before MDMA was made illegal suggest that MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy may benefit people with PTSD, and there is an ongoing placebo‐controlled study of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy in people with crime or war‐related PTSD occurring in the US. This study will look at MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy in 12 individuals aged 18 years or older diagnosed with PTSD that arose out of war or terrorism‐related trauma, with PTSD symptoms not improving after trying at least one treatment. Eight of 12 participants will be assigned to receive the full dose of MDMA, and four will be assigned to receive a low or ""active placebo"" dose of MDMA during each of two experimental sessions. People will be assigned to full or low‐dose MDMA ""by chance,"" as by flipping a coin. The fully active dose consists of an initial dose of 125 mg MDMA and a supplemental dose of 62.5 mg given 2 to 2.5 hours later. The active placebo dose consists of an initial dose of 25 mg MDMA and a supplemental dose of 12.5 mg. The study will last approximately four months, and will include two sixty minute long introductory psychotherapy sessions, two active placebo or fully active dose MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy sessions, a sixty to ninety minute long psychotherapy session 24 hours after each experimental session, and one to two hour‐long psychotherapy sessions occurring weekly between the first and second experimental session, and between the second experimental session and the end of the study. PTSD symptoms will be measured at the start of the study and eight weeks (two months) after the second experimental session. PTSD symptoms are assessed six and twelve months after the second experimental session in people who do not take part in the open‐label study continuation. People who take part in the open‐label study continuation will have their PTSD symptoms measured six and twelve months after the second MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy session.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"6158","Comparative Acute Effects of LSD, Psilocybin and Mescaline.^\nLSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), psilocybin (the active substance in ""magic mushrooms"") and mescaline (the active substance in Peyote and San Pedro cacti) are serotonergic hallucinogens widely used for recreational and/or ethnomedical purposes. LSD, psilocybin and mescaline are thought to induce prototypical psychedelic effects primarily via stimulation of the 5‐HT2A receptor. However, there are differences in their molecular structures (LSD: ergoline, psilocybin: tryptamine; mescaline: phenethylamine)and receptor activation profiles which may induce different subjective effects. To date, there are no modern studies comparing these three substances directly within the same clinical study and research subjects using validated psychometric tools. Therefore, the LPM‐Study compares the acute effects of LSD, psilocybin, mescaline and placebo in a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, 4‐period cross‐over design with four treatment conditions: 1) 100 μg LSD, 2) 20 mg psilocybin, 3) 300 mg mescaline, and 4) placebo. The main objective of this study is to determine whether LSD, psilocybin and mescaline produce qualitatively similar subjective alterations of mind and associated brain activity patterns despite their unique receptor activation profiles. The study investigates psychological (psychometry), physiological and neuronal (magnetic resonance imaging) variables. The LPM‐Study provides insight into the acute effects profiles of three serotonergic hallucinogens. It will enhance the understanding of psychedelic‐induced altered states of consciousness in humans and will be relevant for the fields of psychiatry, psychology, and forensic toxicology.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"

"6247","The Effect of LSD on Neural Synchrony, Prosocial Behavior, and Relationship Quality.^\nEvidence is growing that psychedelic substances such as psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and ayahuasca could be a potential alternative treatment option for common and difficult to treat psychiatric conditions. One proposed mechanism that psychedelics target, which is a hallmark of seemingly all psychiatric disorders, are deficits in social cognitive abilities. However, the neural underpinnings of psychedelic induced alterations in prosocial behavior are currently unknown. The investigators hypothesize psychedelics increase such prosocial behaviors by increasing neural synchrony, which is the coupling of brain‐to‐brain activity across two or more people; it has been found to underlie social connection and various forms of shared prosocial behavior. The current project will primarily assess whether LSD enhances neural synchrony between romantic partners. Second, the investigators will assess whether LSD enhances prosocial behavior between members of a dyad, thus replicating previous studies which assessed prosocial behavior within one individual at a time. The investigators will also assess the relationship between neural synchrony and outcome variables of the prosocial behaviour tasks. Lastly, it will be assessed whether LSD‐induced changes in neural synchrony and/or prosocial behaviour affect persisting relationship quality. Oxytocin and cytokine concentrations, will also be quantified to investigate whether there is a relationship between these factors and changes in prosocial behaviour. The study design will be conducted according to a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, 2‐way crossover design. Healthy participants (N=60) who are in a relationship (N=30 couples) will receive placebo and an oral dose of 50 µg of LSD. Between each condition, there will be a minimum of 14 days washout. This leads to a total study duration of minimally four weeks, for a participant to go through the medical examination and both drug conditions.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"6262","A Randomised, Controlled Trial of MDMA-assisted Prolonged Exposure Therapy for Comorbid Alcohol Use Disorder and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder.^\nWe urgently require new strategies for the treatment of comorbid PTSD and alcohol dependence.

MDMA may be a promising approach to improve response to COPE for this population. Emerging evidence suggests that MDMA‐assisted therapy may be of promise for PTSD, and has demonstrated a good safety profile and potential efficacy in alcohol dependence. This project will evaluate the clinical efficacy and tolerability of MDMA‐assisted COPE relative to a placebo‐assisted COPE.

"7538","Cognitive disorders after sporadic ecstasy use? A case report.^\nMemory problems and changes in hippocampal structures after chronic ecstasy use are well described in the literature. Cognitive problems after incidental ecstasy use are rare, and the few patients described in case reports returned to their normal cognitive level after a relative short period. FV is a 39-year-old man who used an ecstasy tablet in 2005. This resulted in severe confusion for a few days. The confusion was followed by persistent memory complaints and difficulties orientating in new surroundings. An extensive neuropsychological examination 7 years after the ecstasy use revealed a severe memory disorder. Furthermore, his performance on a virtual reality test of navigation showed serious problems navigating in new surroundings. In comparison with matched control subjects (Bayesian approach for single case studies) his scores were significantly impaired on several subtasks of the navigation test. On a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain bilateral hippocampal atrophy and sclerosis were visible, comparable to previous MRI studies describing hippocampal damage following ecstasy ingestion. This case report describes persistent memory and navigation disorders after sporadic ecstasy use, supported by structural brain abnormalities seen on the MRI scan. These findings revive the debate on whether sporadic ecstasy use can cause persistent cognitive deficits.","[0, 1, 0, 0]"
"8062","Ketamine augmentation for major depressive disorder and suicidal ideation: Preliminary experience in an inpatient psychiatry setting.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is known to rapidly reduce depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation (SI) in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), but evidence is limited for its acceptability and effectiveness in ""real-world"" settings. This case series examines serial ketamine infusions in reducing SI and depression scores in adults with MDD admitted to a tertiary care hospital. METHODS: Five inpatients with MDD and SI admitted to hospital in Toronto, Canada received six infusions of 0.5 mg/kg intravenous (IV) ketamine (n = 5) over approximately 12 days, in addition to treatment-as-usual. Suicide and depression rating scores (Scale for Suicidal Ideation, SSI; Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale, MADRS) were obtained at baseline, on treatment days, on days 14 and 42 (primary endpoint). RESULTS: All patients experienced benefit with ketamine. SSI scores diminished by 84% from 14.0 ± 4.5 at baseline to 2.2 ± 2.5 at study endpoint. MADRS scores diminished by 47% from 42.2 ± 5.3 at baseline to 22.4 ± 8.0. Two patients withdrew from the study, one to initiate electroconvulsive therapy and one due to an adverse event (dissociative effects) during the ketamine infusion. LIMITATIONS: The major limitation of this study is the small sample size. DISCUSSION: These preliminary pilot data are promising with a greater than two-fold reduction in SI following ketamine infusions. They demonstrate that six serial ketamine infusions may be safe and feasible. These findings support the need for large scale randomized controlled trials to confirm the efficacy of serial ketamine for treatment of SI in ""real-world"" settings.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"8621","High intensity dependence of auditory evoked dipole source activity indicates decreased serotonergic activity in abstinent ecstasy (MDMA) users.^\nNeurotoxic damage of central serotonergic systems has been demonstrated in numerous animal studies after exposure to methylenedioxyamphetamines (ecstasy). A high intensity dependence of auditory evoked potentials and, particularly, of the tangential N1/P2 source activity has been associated with low levels of serotonergic neurotransmission in humans. We performed an auditory evoked potentials study in 28 abstinent recreational ecstasy users and two equally sized groups of cannabis users and nonusers. The ecstasy users exhibited an increase of the amplitude of the tangential N1/P2 source activity with higher stimulus intensities; whereas, both control groups failed to exhibit this feature. These data are in line with the hypothesis that abstinent ecstasy users present with diminished central serotonergic activity. This feature of information processing is probably related to the well-recognized neurotoxic potential of ecstasy. Our data indicate that recreational ecstasy use may cause long-term alterations in the function (and possibly structure) of the human brain.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"9612","White matter alterations in chronic MDMA use: Evidence from diffusion tensor imaging and neurofilament light chain blood levels.^\n3,4–Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, “Ecstasy”) is a serotonin- and noradrenaline-releasing substance, currently among the most widely used illicit substances worldwide. In animal studies, repeated exposure to MDMA has been associated with dendritic but also axonal degeneration in the brain. However, translation of the axonal findings, specifically, to humans has been repeatedly questioned and the few existing studies investigating white matter alterations in human chronic MDMA users have yielded conflicting findings. In this study, we combined whole-brain diffusion tensor imaging and neurofilament light chain (NfL) analysis in blood to reveal potential MDMA-induced axonal neuropathology. To this end, we assessed 39 chronic MDMA users and 39 matched MDMA-naïve healthy controls. MDMA users showed increased fractional anisotropy in several white matter tracts, most prominently in the corpus callosum as well as corticospinal tracts, with these findings partly related to MDMA use intensity. However, the NfL levels of MDMA users were not significantly different from those of controls. We conclude that MDMA use is not associated with significant white matter lesions due to the absence of reduced fractional anisotropy and increased NfL levels commonly observed in conditions associated with white matter lesions, including stimulant and ketamine use disorders. Hence, the MDMA-induced axonal degradation demonstrated in animal models was not observed in this human study of chronic MDMA users.","[1, 1, 0, 0]"

"170","Evidence of neurotoxicity of ecstasy: Sustained effects on electroencephalographic activity in polydrug users.^\nObjective: According to previous EEG reports of indicative disturbances in Alpha and Beta activities, a systematic search for distinct EEG abnormalities in a broader population of Ecstasy users may especially corroborate the presumed specific neurotoxicity of Ecstasy in humans. Methods: 105 poly-drug consumers with former Ecstasy use and 41 persons with comparable drug history without Ecstasy use, and 11 drug naives were investigated for EEG features. Conventional EEG derivations of 19 electrodes according to the 10-20-system were conducted. Besides standard EEG bands, quantitative EEG analyses of 1-Hz-subdivided power ranges of Alpha, Theta and Beta bands have been considered. Results: Ecstasy users with medium and high cumulative Ecstasy doses revealed an increase in Theta and lower Alpha activities, significant increases in Beta activities, and a reduction of background activity. Ecstasy users with low cumulative Ecstasy doses showed a significant Alpha activity at 11 Hz. Interestingly, the spectral power of low frequencies in medium and high Ecstasy users was already significantly increased in the early phase of EEG recording. Statistical analyses suggested the main effect of Ecstasy to EEG results. Conclusions: Our data from a major sample of Ecstasy users support previous data revealing alterations of EEG frequency spectrum due rather to neurotoxic effects of Ecstasy on serotonergic systems in more detail. Accordingly, our data may be in line with the observation of attentional and memory impairments in Ecstasy users with moderate to high misuse. Despite the methodological problem of polydrug use also in our approach, our EEG results may be indicative of the neuropathophysiological background of the reported memory and attentional deficits in Ecstasy abusers. Overall, our findings may suggest the usefulness of EEG in diagnostic approaches in assessing neurotoxic sequela of this common drug abuse. © 2010 Adamaszek et al.","[1, 1, 0, 0]"
"514","Use patterns and self-reported effects of Salvia divinorum: an internet-based survey.^\nBACKGROUND: There is growing use of Salvia divinorum (SD), a psychoactive plant that produces hallucinogen-like effects through a kappa opioid receptor (KOR) mechanism. Little is known about KOR agonist effects in humans and about users of SD. OBJECTIVES: To characterize the reasons, methods, and reported consequences of SD use. METHODS: Individuals reading SD-related pages of a drug-information website were invited to anonymously complete an online questionnaire if they had used SD. RESULTS: Participants (N=500) were 92.6% male and 23.4 ± 8.7 (mean ± s.d.) years old. They had used a median of six times (range 1-250). 80.6% probably or definitely would use SD again. Most participants (92.6%) typically smoked or vaporized SD product. When smoked, the drug's main effects were estimated to last 14.1 ± 12.8 (range 0.5-120) minutes. When asked to compare SD effects to other methods of altering consciousness, the most common answer was that SD was unique (38.4%). 25.8% reported persisting (≥ 24 h) positive effects (often described as increased sense of well-being) on at least one occasion. 4.4% reported persisting negative effects (most often anxiety). CONCLUSIONS: SD is typically smoked, acute effects are brief, and persistent adverse effects are uncommon. In addition to acute hallucinogenic effects, SD may produce subacute increases in subjective well-being. Such a subacute effect would be unusual for a drug that is used non-medically, as withdrawal from other drugs typically either does not affect mood or causes dysphoria.

"718","Metamemory in recreational ecstasy polydrug users: What do self-reports of memory failures mean?.^\nPrevious research has found relationships between self-rated memory and ecstasy use, such that heavier users report worse function. These findings have been interpreted in terms of objective memory capacity. However, research on metamemory suggests that self-reported memory may be only weakly related to objective function, with demographics, mood, and memory-related beliefs and feelings also contributing to ratings. This study examined relationships between ecstasy/other drug use and self-reported memory, controlling for effects of demographic factors and mood. Associations between self-reported memory, memory-related beliefs and feelings, and objectively-measured cognitive function were also examined. Forty-five ecstasy polydrug, 48 cannabis polydrug, and 40 legal drug users completed a battery of neuropsychological tests and questionnaire measures of metamemory, including memory-related control beliefs, memory-related anxiety, and self-reported prospective and general/retrospective memory. The combined polydrug groups reported more general/retrospective memory failures. Covariance analysis, however, suggested that this finding was confounded by general anxiety levels. A combination of objective cognitive measures contributed to prediction of self-rated prospective memory, with demographics, mood, and memory-related anxiety also contributing to variability. However, associations between objective and self-reported memory were not strong.

Design: We have completed the Phase I component, a double‐blind, singleascending dose study, assessing safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of four intravenous (IV) doses of SPL026 with therapy in psychedelic‐naive healthy volunteers (6 active and 2 placebo per cohort). Results: SPL026 was safe and well tolerated, with no serious adverse events and few drug‐related adverse events across all dose cohorts. Detailed PK profiles for DMT were elucidated, and a model was developed to understand and predict the PK profiles of various doses of SPL026. DMT is rapidly metabolized, with a half‐life of about 11 minutes, which underpins the observed short psychedelic experiences of up to 30 minutes. Following PK/PD analysis, a strong exposureresponse relationship for both the intensity and quality of the psychedelic experience was demonstrated. In addition, no correlation between exposure versus age, weight, or body mass index (BMI) of subjects was shown. Conclusion: We have developed a safe and well‐tolerated IV infusion protocol and accompanying psychotherapy model for administration of SPL026 to elicit, in a dose‐predictive way, a significant psychedelic experience with the potential to provide therapeutic efficacy in a number of mental health disorders. Psychedelics, such as DMT, offer the potential of an alternative treatment paradigm to the traditional selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or psychotherapy models currently available to patients.

"1447","Effects of adjunctive ketamine ntravenous infusion in taiwanese patients with treatment-resistant depression: Antidepression, antisuicidality, BDNF Val66Met, and brain imaging.^\nAbout 21% of Taiwanese patients with major depression developed treatment-resistant depression (TRD) during 1-year follow-up in Taiwan. TRD was commonly coupled with functional impairment, poor quality of life, suicide ideation and attempts, self-injurious behaviors, and a high relapse rate. From 2012 and 2015, we had conducted the first randomized, double-blind, placebo control trial in Asian countries to examine the therapeutic efficacy of a single low-dose ketamine infusion in Taiwanese patients with TRD. Seventy one subjects were evenly distributed in three dose groups with 0.5 mg/kg, 0.2 mg/kg, and placebo, respectively. Responder was identified by response (≥ 50% reduction of mood ratings) at any two daily HAMD measures during the period of 24-96 h (day 2-5) post-ketamine infusion. There was a significant difference in the response rate across the three groups (0.5 mg/kg: 45.8%; 0.2 mg/kg: 39.1%; placebo: 12.5%; p = 0.03), which is much lower than that in the Caucasians (70%). Two factors might be related: lower serum ketamine levels and lower Val/Val allele percentage in BDNF Val66Met genotyping found in the Taiwanese patients. In addition to the rapid antidepressant effect of ketamine, a greater antisuicidal effect (59%) was also identified. The former may only account for 52.7% of the latter, indicating that the antisuicidality may be independent from antidepressiveness. Single dose of ketamine only resulted in short-lived psychedelic/dissociation adverse effect, which was resolved within 2 h post-infusion. Up to present, no long-term side effects were identified, given a single-dose administration. Using 18F-FDG-PET scanning and 24 h post-ketamine infusion, glucose metabolism of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), supplementary motor area (SMA), and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) were activated immediately (40 min post-infusion), and activation of SMA and dACC could sustain for 1 day, which may contribute to the persistent antidepressant effect of ketamine beyond its half-life, suggesting that a short activation in the PFC engendered by ketamine infusion may be a kindler, facilitating the persistent increase in glucose metabolism in the SMA and dACC; therefore, the PFC may be still considered to play a key role in improving TRD. These findings were also supported by a simple wearable forehead EEG monitoring from baseline to 40 min post-infusion, revealing that ketamine may increase the theta and low alpha power and decrease asymmetry in the PFC. Finally, a maintenance trial in a double-blind, randomized fashion using a partial NMDA agonist, d-cycloserine (DCS) vs. placebo, was conducted in the ketamine responders. This DCS augmentation treatment was not superior to placebo in maintaining the initial antidepressant response to ketamine infusion, but DCS did appear to maintain the antisuicidal effect during the 6-week follow-up study. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"1745","Reduced auditory evoked gamma-band response and schizophrenia-like clinical symptoms under subanesthetic ketamine.^\nAbnormal gamma-band oscillations (GBO) have been frequently associated with the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. GBO are modulated by glutamate, a neurotransmitter, which is continuously discussed to shape the complex symptom spectrum in schizophrenia. The current study examined the effects of ketamine, a glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, on the auditory-evoked gamma-band response (aeGBR) and psychopathological outcomes in healthy volunteers to investigate neuronal mechanisms of psychotic behavior. In a placebo-controlled, randomized crossover design, the aeGBR power, phase-locking factor (PLF) during a choice reaction task, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Altered State of Consciousness (5D-ASC) Rating Scale were assessed in 25 healthy subjects. Ketamine was applied in a subanaesthetic dose. Low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography was used for EEG source localization. Significant reductions of the aeGBR power and PLF were identified under ketamine administration compared to placebo (p < 0.01). Source-space analysis of aeGBR generators revealed significantly reduced current source density (CSD) within the anterior cingulate cortex during ketamine administration. Ketamine induced an increase in all PANSS (p < 0.001) as well as 5D-ASC scores (p < 0.01) and increased response times (p < 0.001) and error rates (p < 0.01). Only negative symptoms were significantly associated with an aeGBR power decrease (p = 0.033) as revealed by multiple linear regression. These findings argue for a substantial role of the glutamate system in the mediation of dysfunctional gamma band responses and negative symptomatology of schizophrenia and are compatible with the NMDAR hypofunction hypothesis of schizophrenia.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"2105","Acute dose-response effects of LSD in healthy humans.^\nBackground: LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) is a classic hallucinogen. It was widely studied in the 1950s to 1970s as an adjunct to psychotherapy (psycholytic therapy) and as a model to study psychotic states. Today, LSD is again in the focus of several investigations ranging from pharmacological research studies in healthy subjects [1‐3] to studies investigating LSD as a possible treatment for anxiety associated with terminal illness [4]. Because of the continued popularity of LSD as recreational drug and renewed interest in its therapeutic use we examined the acute response to two different doses of LSD in healthy subjects under controlled conditions. Methods: Data from two double‐blind, placebo controlled experimental studies were used to establish dose‐response relationships. Study 1 investigated the effects of 100mg LSD vs. Placebo and study 2 investigated the effects of 200mg LSD vs. Placebo. Both studies were performed in a cross‐over design.

The inclusion and exclusion criteria were identical for both studies. Subjects younger than 25 years of age were excluded from participating in the study. Additional exclusion criteria were age >65 years, pregnancy, personal or family history of major psychiatric disorders, use of medications that may interfere with the study medication, chronic or acute physical illness, tobacco smoking (>10 cigarettes/day), and a lifetime prevalence of illicit drug use >10 times. Subjective effects were measured using validated psychometric tools including visual analog scales, adjective mood rating scale and the altered states of consciousness scale. Heart rate, blood pressure, and pupil size were also recorded. Further, we measured plasma concentration of LSD and its main metabolites in both studies to investigate pharmacokinetic ‐ pharmacodynamic relationships. Results: LSD produced positively‐experienced derealization and depersonalization and visual restructuralization including synaesthesia after 100 μg and 200 LSD in a dose‐dependent manner. Additionally, LSD produced empathic effects such as “closeness” “openness”, and “trust”. Empathic effects were found higher after 200 μg than after 100 μg. Subjective effects after 200 μg lasted up to 12 hours, and up to 10 hours after 100 μg. Negative associated effects, mainly transient anxiety, were more pronounced under 200 μg than after 100 μg. LSD did also moderately increase systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body temperature, and pupil size. LSD did not produce fearful reactions or negative experiences in this controlled setting. Conclusion: LSD induced mainly positive subjective effects in a dose‐dependent manner in a controlled laboratory setting in healthy subjects. Our findings show that 100 μg and 200 μg of LSD induce empathic effects to different degrees which is an important finding regarding its potential use in psycholytic therapy.","[1, 1, 0, 0]"
"2176","Reduced memory skills and increased hair cortisol levels in recent Ecstasy/MDMA users: Significant but independent neurocognitive and neurohormonal deficits.^\nObjectives The goals of this study were to measure the neurocognitive performance of recent users of recreational Ecstasy and investigate whether it was associated with the stress hormone cortisol. Methods The 101 participants included 27 recent light users of Ecstasy (one to four times in the last 3 months), 23 recent heavier Ecstasy users (five or more times) and 51 non-users. Rivermead paragraph recall provided an objective measure for immediate and delayed recall. The prospective and retrospective memory questionnaire provided a subjective index of memory deficits. Cortisol levels were taken from near-scalp 3-month hair samples. Results Cortisol was significantly raised in recent heavy Ecstasy users compared with controls, whereas hair cortisol in light Ecstasy users was not raised. Both Ecstasy groups were significantly impaired on the Rivermead delayed word recall, and both groups reported significantly more retrospective and prospective memory problems. Stepwise regression confirmed that lifetime Ecstasy predicted the extent of these memory deficits. Conclusions Recreational Ecstasy is associated with increased levels of the bio-energetic stress hormone cortisol and significant memory impairments. No significant relationship between cortisol and the cognitive deficits was observed. Ecstasy users did display evidence of a metacognitive deficit, with the strength of the correlations between objective and subjective memory performances being significantly lower in the Ecstasy users.","[1, 1, 0, 0]"
"2627","The Association Between the Negative Effects Attributed to Ecstasy Use and Measures of Cognition and Mood Among Users.^\nIn self reports, abstinent ecstasy/polydrug users claim that they experience certain ongoing affective and psychological changes including elevated anxiety, arousal, and depression. In addition, various aspects of cognition (e.g., everyday memory, reasoning, executive functioning) appear to be affected. The present paper investigated the link between these two psychological sequelae. Ninety-five ecstasy/polydrug users completed tests of reasoning, intelligence, information processing speed, executive functioning, and everyday memory. Affect was measured via a mood adjective checklist. Adverse effects attributed to ecstasy were measured via responses to adjectives reflecting changes in users since they started using the drug. In addition, indicators of sleep quality and daytime sleepiness were obtained. Users attributed a number of adverse effects to ecstasy, namely heightened irritability, depression, paranoia, and deteriorating health. Adverse effects were significantly and negatively correlated with aspects of intelligence, everyday memory, and sleep quality. Length of use of ecstasy use was positively correlated with adverse effects. While many users attribute a number of adverse affects to their use of ecstasy, it remains unclear whether these self-perceptions are a corollary of the psychopharmacological effects of the drug or reflect factors which in fact predate its use. © 2009 American Psychological Association.","[0, 1, 0, 0]"
"2820","Repeated intranasal ketamine for treatment-resistant depression - the way to go? Results from a pilot randomised controlled trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine research in depression has mostly used intravenous, weight-based approaches, which are difficult to translate clinically. Intranasal (IN) ketamine is a promising alternative but no controlled data has been published on the feasibility, safety and potential efficacy of repeated IN ketamine treatments. METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study compared a 4-week course of eight treatments of 100 mg ketamine or 4.5 mg midazolam. Each treatment was given as 10 separate IN sprays, self-administered 5 min apart. The study was stopped early due to poor tolerability after five treatment-resistant depressed participants were included. Feasibility, safety (acute and cumulative), cognitive and efficacy outcomes were assessed. Plasma ketamine and norketamine concentrations were assayed after the first treatment. RESULTS: Significant acute cardiovascular, psychotomimetic and neurological side effects occurred at doses < 100 mg ketamine. No participants were able to self-administer all 10 ketamine sprays due to incoordination; treatment time occasionally had to be extended (>45 min) due to acute side effects. No hepatic, cognitive or urinary changes were observed after the treatment course in either group. There was an approximately two-fold variation in ketamine and norketamine plasma concentrations between ketamine participants. At course end, one participant had remitted in each of the ketamine and midazolam groups. CONCLUSIONS: IN ketamine, with the drug formulation and delivery device used, was not a useful treatment approach in this study. Absorption was variable between individuals and acute tolerability was poor, requiring prolonged treatment administration time in some individuals. The drug formulation, the delivery device, the insufflation technique and individual patient factors play an important role in tolerability and efficacy when using IN ketamine for TRD.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"2912","Safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic evaluation of a noribogaine multiple-dose regimen in opioid-dependent subjects.^\nOpioid dependence is a significant public health issue. Improved non‐addictive, non‐opioid treatments to help opioid‐dependent individuals stop opioid use and remain abstinent are needed. Ibogaine has been explored as treatment for substance dependence, but its psychotomimetic effects limit its clinical utility. Noribogaine is an active metabolite of ibogaine and may be more selective in treating opioid dependence without undesirable psychotomimetic effects. Previous clinical studies evaluated single doses of noribogaine and suggested that it is safe and well‐tolerated, but with a concentration‐dependent increase in the QTc interval. This study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of noribogaine HCl capsules after multiple dosing in treatment‐seeking opioid‐dependent subjects. Background: The development of treatments for opioid dependence, a significant public health issue, is of high importance. Educational objectives include: (1) describe noribogaine as a potential non‐addictive, non‐opioid treatment for opioid dependence, (2) examine the utility of a predefined dosing algorithm to avoid pronounced QTc prolongation (QTcF >500 msec or ΔQTcF >60 msec) in multiple dose studies of drugs that exhibit a concentration‐dependent increase in the QTc interval, (3) recognize the importance of conducting controlled clinical trials in the opioid‐dependent population while acknowledging the challenges of studying this population. Methods: This was a phase 1B, open‐label, titration study conducted in an inpatient clinical unit. A loading dose of oral noribogaine 80 mg was followed by titrated maintenance dosing (10, 20, 30, or 40 mg, q6h) for up to 5 days. Maintenance dosing considered subjective and objective clinical assessments and QTcF using a predefined algorithm to avoid pronounced QT prolongation (QTcF >500 msec or ΔQTcF >60 msec was exclusionary). Standard safety evaluations, PK, and PD assessments (eg, opioid withdrawal and mood scales) were conducted. Continuous cardiac monitoring was performed via Holter monitor and telemetry. Results: Nine subjects (6 males; mean age 31.2 years) were enrolled. Documented opioid use included heroin and prescription opioids. Cumulative noribogaine doses ranged from 80mg to 670 mg, with 4 subjects administered the maximum 20 doses (mean 653 mg, range 640‐670 mg). No serious adverse events (AEs) were reported. Of treatmentemergent AEs, 96% were mild in severity, none were severe and 58% were opioid withdrawal‐related. Noribogaine plasma concentrations showed high intersubject variability, even between subjects with similar unit/daily/total doses. Cmax values following multiple dosing ranging from 52 to 252 (mean 102) ng/mL. After oral administration of noribogaine, observed plasma concentrations over time were consistent with an open, 2 compartment first‐order absorption model. Steady‐state was reached between 12 and 24 hours in a majority of subjects (5) and within 48 hours for the remaining (2). The largest ΔQTcF by subject ranged from 22‐51 msec (mean 33 msec). A concentration‐dependent increase in DQTcF was observed, corresponding to a predicted ΔQTcF of 17 msec at the geometric mean peak concentration of 89.1 ng/mL. No QTc changes resulted in AEs or discontinuation. Scores on withdrawal and mood scales decreased rapidly and substantially following administration of noribogaine, and this was supported by non‐solicited self‐reports that the withdrawal experience was less severe compared with previous attempts in the majority of subjects. Mean (SD) SOWS score at baseline was 30.3 (10.6) and declined to 16.8 (7.4) one hour after loading dose administration; at 51 hours post‐loading dose, mean SOWS score was 10.4 (9.7). Mean (SD) POMS total mood disturbance (TMD) score was 53.8 (22.2) at baseline and declined to 37.3 (43.3) at 57 hours post‐loading dose. Consistent with the expected time course of opioid withdrawal, 3 subjects experienced an increase in withdrawal symptoms 48‐72 h post the last pre‐t eatment opioid administration (mean of 11 h prior to noribogaine loading dose), 2 of whom withdrew from the study. All 4 subjects who remained in the clinic after 72 hours experienced further decreases in withdrawal and mood scores (SOWS: 4.8 (4.9) at 81 h; POMS TMD: 0.8 (4.6) at 84 h). Subjects returned to their pre‐treatment environment, largely devoid of support; 5 subjects relapsed, 3 were lost to follow‐up, and 1 remained abstinent (15 weeks). Conclusions: Noribogaine treatment for up to 5 days was well tolerated. The previously noted QTc effect was confirmed, and a dosing algorithm with QTc criteria was successful in avoiding pronounced QTc prolongation (i.e., no QTcF>500 msec or ΔQTcF >60 msec). Steady‐state noribogaine concentrations were reached rapidly with the use of a loading dose. Clinically significant reductions in withdrawal symptoms and mood assessments were seen following noribogaine administration. These findings support continued evaluation of noribogaine in treating opioid dependence under medical supervision in controlled clinical trials. Educational Objectives: At the conclusions of this activity, participants should be able to: 1. Describe noribogaine as a potential non‐addictive, nonopioid treatment for opioid dependence. 2. Examine the utility of a predefined dosing algorithm to avoid pronounced QTc prolongation. 3. Recognize the importance/challenge of conducting controlled clinical trials in the opioid‐dependents.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"2957","Glutamatergic Signaling Drives Ketamine-Mediated Response in Depression: Evidence from Dynamic Causal Modeling.^\nBACKGROUND: The glutamatergic modulator ketamine has rapid antidepressant effects in individuals with major depressive disorder and bipolar depression. Thus, modulating glutamatergic transmission may be critical to effectively treating depression, though the mechanisms by which this occurs are not fully understood. METHODS: This double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study analyzed data from 18 drug-free major depressive disorder subjects and 18 heathy controls who received a single i.v. infusion of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) as well as an i.v. saline placebo. Magnetoencephalographic recordings were collected prior to the first infusion and 6 to 9 hours after both ketamine and placebo infusions. During scanning, participants passively received tactile stimulation to the right index finger. Antidepressant response was assessed across timepoints using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. Dynamic causal modeling was used to measure changes in α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA)- and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-mediated connectivity estimates in major depressive disorder subjects and controls using a simple model of somatosensory evoked responses. RESULTS: Both major depressive disorder and healthy subjects showed ketamine-mediated NMDA-blockade sensitization, with major depressive disorder subjects showing enhanced NMDA connectivity estimates in backward connections and controls showing enhanced NMDA connectivity estimates in forward connections in our model. Within our major depressive disorder subject group, ketamine efficacy, as measured by improved mood ratings, correlated with reduced NMDA and AMPA connectivity estimates in discrete extrinsic connections within the somatosensory cortical network. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that AMPA- and NMDA-mediated glutamatergic signaling play a key role in antidepressant response to ketamine and, further, that dynamic causal modeling is a powerful tool for modeling AMPA- and NMDA-mediated connectivity in vivo.

"3175","Survey of subjective ""God encounter experiences"": Comparisons among naturally occurring experiences and those occasioned by the classic psychedelics psilocybin, LSD, ayahuasca, or DMT.^\nNaturally occurring and psychedelic drug–occasioned experiences interpreted as personal encounters with God are well described but have not been systematically compared. In this study, five groups of individuals participated in an online survey with detailed questions characterizing the subjective phenomena, interpretation, and persisting changes attributed to their single most memorable God encounter experience (n = 809 Non-Drug, 1184 psilocybin, 1251 lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), 435 ayahuasca, and 606 N,N-dimethyltrypta-mine (DMT)). Analyses of differences in experiences were adjusted statistically for demographic differences between groups. The Non-Drug Group was most likely to choose ""God"" as the best descriptor of that which was encountered while the psychedelic groups were most likely to choose ""Ultimate Reality."" Although there were some other differences between non-drug and the combined psychedelic group, as well as between the four psychedelic groups, the similarities among these groups were most striking. Most participants reported vivid memories of the encounter experience, which frequently involved communication with something having the attributes of being conscious, benevolent, intelligent, sacred, eternal, and all-knowing. The encounter experience fulfilled a priori criteria for being a complete mystical experience in approximately half of the participants. More than two-thirds of those who identified as atheist before the experience no longer identified as atheist afterwards. These experiences were rated as among the most personally meaningful and spiritually significant lifetime experiences, with moderate to strong persisting positive changes in life satisfaction, purpose, and meaning attributed to these experiences. Among the four groups of psychedelic users, the psilocybin and LSD groups were most similar and the ayahuasca group tended to have the highest rates of endorsing positive features and enduring consequences of the experience. Future exploration of predisposing factors and phenomenological and neural correlates of such experiences may provide new insights into religious and spiritual beliefs that have been integral to shaping human culture since time immemorial.","[0, 1, 0, 0]"
"3662","Subanesthetic dose of ketamine decreases prefrontal theta cordance in healthy volunteers: implications for antidepressant effect.^\nBACKGROUND: Theta cordance is a novel quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) measure that correlates with cerebral perfusion. A series of clinical studies has demonstrated that the prefrontal theta cordance value decreases after 1 week of treatment in responders to antidepressants and that this effect precedes clinical improvement. Ketamine, a non-competitive antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, has a unique rapid antidepressant effect but its influence on theta cordance is unknown. METHOD: In a double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled experiment we studied the acute effect of ketamine (0.54 mg/kg within 30 min) on theta cordance in a group of 20 healthy volunteers. RESULTS: Ketamine infusion induced a decrease in prefrontal theta cordance and an increase in the central region theta cordance after 10 and 30 min. The change in prefrontal theta cordance correlated with ketamine and norketamine blood levels after 10 min of ketamine infusion. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that ketamine infusion immediately induces changes similar to those that monoamineric-based antidepressants induce gradually. The reduction in theta cordance could be a marker and a predictor of the fast-acting antidepressant effect of ketamine, a hypothesis that could be tested in depressive patients treated with ketamine.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"3899","Plasma drug concentrations and physiological measures in 'dance party' participants.^\nThe increasing use of (±) 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in the setting of large dance parties ('raves') and clubs has been the source of some concern, because of potential acute adverse events, and because animal studies suggest that MDMA has the potential to damage brain serotonin (5-HT) neurons. However, it is not yet known whether MDMA, as used in the setting of dance parties, leads to plasma levels of MDMA that are associated with toxicity to 5-HT neurons in animals. The present study sought to address this question. Plasma MDMA concentrations, vital signs, and a variety of blood and urine measures were obtained prior to, and hours after, individuals attended a dance party. After the dance party, subjects were without clinical complaints, had measurable amounts of residual MDMA in plasma, and nearly half of the subjects also tested positive for methamphetamine, another amphetamine analog that has been shown to have 5-HT neurotoxic potential in animals. Plasma concentrations of MDMA did not correlate with self-reported use of 'ecstasy' and, in some subjects, overlapped with those that have been associated with 5-HT neurotoxicity in non-human primates. Additional subjects were likely to have had similar concentrations while at the dance party, when one considers the reported time of drug ingestion and the plasma half-life of MDMA in humans. Hematological and biochemical analyses were generally unremarkable. Moderate increases in blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature were observed in the subjects with the highest MDMA plasma concentrations. These findings are consistent with epidemiological findings that most people who use MDMA at dance parties do not develop serious clinical complications, and suggest that some of these individuals may be at risk for developing MDMA-induced toxicity to brain serotonin neurons. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"4579","Subanesthetic effects of the noncompetitive NMDA antagonist, ketamine, in humans. Psychotomimetic, perceptual, cognitive, and neuroendocrine responses.^\nBACKGROUND: To characterize further behavioral, cognitive, neuroendocrine, and physiological effects of subanesthetic doses of ketamine hydrochloride in healthy human subjects. Ketamine, a phencyclidine hydrochloride derivative, is a dissociative anesthetic and a noncompetitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of excitatory amino acid receptor. METHODS: Nineteen healthy subjects recruited by advertisements from the community participated in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Subjects completed three test days involving the 40-minute intravenous administration of placebo, ketamine hydrochloride (0.1 mg/kg), or ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg). Behaviors associated with the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia were assessed by using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Changes in perception and behaviors associated with dissociative states were assessed by the Perceptual Aberration Subscale of the Wisconsin Psychosis Proneness Scale and the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale. Cognitive function was assessed by using the (1) Mini-Mental State Examination; (2) tests sensitive to frontal cortical dysfunction, including a continuous performance vigilance task, a verbal fluency task, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; and (3) tests of immediate and delayed recall. Plasma levels of cortisol, prolactin, homovanillic acid, and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethyleneglycol were measured. RESULTS: Ketamine (1) produced behaviors similar to the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia; (2) elicited alterations in perception; (3) impaired performance on tests of vigilance, verbal fluency, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; (4) evoked symptoms similar to dissociative states; and (5) preferentially disrupted delayed word recall, sparing immediate recall and postdistraction recall. Ketamine had no significant effect on the Mini-Mental State Examination at the doses studied. Ketamine also had no effect on plasma 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethyleneglycol levels, although it blunted a test day decline in plasma homovanillic acid levels at the higher dose. It also dose dependently increased plasma cortisol and prolactin levels. Ketamine produced small dose-dependent increases in blood pressure.

"4728","Patients' recovery and non-recovery narratives after intravenous ketamine for treatment-resistant depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Intravenous (IV) ketamine is an effective therapy for treatment-resistant depression. A large data base is confirmatory and steadily expanding. Qualitative studies can inform best practices and suggest new research directions. As part of a clinical trial designed to identify biomarkers of ketamine response, a qualitative study was conducted to characterize experiences with: receiving infusions; recovering or not recovering from depression; and beliefs about why ketamine worked or did not work. METHODS: Adults with treatment-resistant depression received three IV ketamine infusions in a two-week period and were characterized as remitters or non-remitters via symptom reduction 24 h after the third infusion. Qualitative interviews of a subset of participants were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded using deductive and inductive methods. Themes were derived and compared across a broader construct of recovery status. RESULTS: Of the 21 participants, nine (43 %) were characterized as having experienced remission and 12 (57 %) non-remission. Of the 12 non-remitters, five were characterized as having experienced partial recovery based on their subjective experiences, reporting substantial benefit from ketamine infusions despite non-remission status based on scale measurements. Attributions for ketamine's effects included biological and experiential mechanisms. Among non-remitters there was risk of disappointment when adding another failed treatment. LIMITATIONS: A more diverse sample may have yielded different themes. Different patients had different amounts of time elapsed between ketamine infusions and qualitative interview. CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative methods may enhance researchers' characterization of IV ketamine's impact on treatment-resistant depression. While requiring confirmation, patients may benefit from a preparatory milieu that prepares them for multiple recovery pathways; decouples the psychedelic experience from clinical outcomes; and addresses potential risks of another failed treatment.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"4848","Clonazepam treatment of lysergic acid diethylamide-induced hallucinogen persisting perception disorder with anxiety features.^\nAn unique and intriguing characteristic of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and LSD-like substances is the recurrence of some of the symptoms which appear during the intoxication, in the absence of recent intake of hallucinogens. Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD) is a condition in which the re-experiencing of one or more perceptual symptoms causes significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning and may be extremely debilitating. Benzodiazepines are one of the recommended agents for the treatment of HPPD but it is unclear which of them may be more helpful. The goal of our investigation was to assess the efficacy of clonazepam in the treatment of LSD-induced HPPD. Sixteen patients fulfilled entrance criteria. All complained of HPPD with anxiety features for at least 3 months and were drug free at least 3 months. They received clonazepam 2 mg/day for 2 months. Follow-up was continued for 6 months. They were weekly evaluated during the 2 months of clonazepam administration and monthly during the follow-up period using the Clinical Global Impression Scale, a Self-report Scale and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale. Patients reported a significant relief and the presence of only mild symptomatology during the clonazepam administration. This improvement was clearly sustained and persisted during a 6-month follow-up period. This study suggests that high potency benzodiazepines like clonazepam, which has serotonergic properties, may be more effective than low-potency benzodiazepines in the treatment of some patients with LSD-induced HPPD.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"

In this meta-analysis, we explored the effects of LSD on healthy subjects with respect to subjective drug effects, blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature and side effects. METHOD: PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched from January 2010 to December 2020 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of LSD in healthy people. Subsequently, 5 RCTs with 132 healthy people which focused on the effects of LSD were enrolled in our study. RESULT: We found that taking 50, 100 and 200 mcg LSD doses were associated with a significant increase in the maximal difference from the baseline compared to the placebo group among the outcomes of AMRS (Adjective Mood Rating Scale) score. Significant differences existed between the LSD and placebo groups when taking 100 and 200 mcg LSD in acute adverse effects (100 mcg: SMD = .97, 95% confidence interval [CI], .50, 1.44, Z = 4.04, p < .001; 200 mcg: SMD = 1.18, 95% CI, 0.65, 1.72, Z = 4.32, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analysis of the subjective effects of LSD in healthy people revealed moderate significant effect sizes in favor of LSD with no significant adverse effects. A 100 mcg dose of LSD has potential for use in psychological-assisted therapy and may improve the mental fitness of patients with disease-related psychiatric distress.

"5469","Sleep deprivation differentially impairs cognitive performance in abstinent methylenedioxymethamphetamine (""Ecstasy"") users.^\nMethylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ""Ecstasy"") is a popular recreational drug and brain serotonin (5-HT) neurotoxin. Neuroimaging data indicate that some human MDMA users develop persistent deficits in brain 5-HT neuronal markers. Although the consequences of MDMA-induced 5-HT neurotoxicity are not fully understood, abstinent MDMA users have been found to have subtle cognitive deficits and altered sleep architecture. The present study sought to test the hypothesis that sleep disturbance plays a role in cognitive deficits in MDMA users. Nineteen abstinent MDMA users and 21 control subjects participated in a 5 d inpatient study in a clinical research unit. Baseline sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory. Cognitive performance was tested three times daily using a computerized cognitive battery. On the third day of admission, subjects began a 40 h sleep deprivation period and continued cognitive testing using the same daily schedule. At baseline, MDMA users performed less accurately than controls on a task of working memory and more impulsively on four of the seven computerized tests. During sleep deprivation, MDMA users, but not controls, became increasingly impulsive, performing more rapidly at the expense of accuracy on tasks of working and short-term memory. Tests of mediation implicated baseline sleep disturbance in the cognitive decline seen during sleep deprivation. These findings are the first to demonstrate that memory problems in MDMA users may be related, at least in part, to sleep disturbance and suggest that cognitive deficits in MDMA users may become more prominent in situations associated with sleep deprivation.","[1, 1, 0, 0]"

We evaluated the effectiveness of intravenous (IV) ketamine on cognition in 68 adult outpatients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) at the Canadian Rapid Treatment Center of Excellence between July 3, 2018 and April 16, 2020 (NCT04209296). Eligibility criteria for the present retrospective study included: primary diagnosis of major depressive or bipolar disorder; currently depressed; and insufficient response to two or more prior treatments. Participants received four infusions of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5-0.75 mg/kg) over 1-2 weeks. We assessed objective and subjective measures of cognition before and after two infusions, i.e., Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), Trail Making Test-B (TMT-B), Patient Deficits Questionnaire, 5-item (PDQ-5-D). Ketamine significantly improved DSST (effect size [ES]=0.60), TMT-B (ES=0.84), as well as PDQ-5-D scores (ES=0.63), indicative of a moderate-to-large effect size. Improvements in DSST and PDQ-5-D with ketamine were mediated by reductions in depressive symptoms, whereas improvements in TMT-B were independent of changes in depressive symptoms. Our results support the independent, rapid-onset, pro-cognitive effects with IV ketamine in adults with TRD.

"5597","Therapeutic mechanisms of psilocybin: Changes in amygdala and prefrontal functional connectivity during emotional processing after psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Psilocybin has shown promise as a treatment for depression but its therapeutic mechanisms are not properly understood. In contrast to the presumed actions of antidepressants, we recently found increased amygdala responsiveness to fearful faces one day after open-label treatment with psilocybin (25 mg) in 19 patients with treatment-resistant depression, which correlated with treatment efficacy. AIMS: Aiming to further unravel the therapeutic mechanisms of psilocybin, the present study extends this basic activation analysis. We hypothesised changed amygdala functional connectivity, more precisely decreased amygdala-ventromedial prefrontal cortex functional connectivity, during face processing after treatment with psilocybin. METHODS: Psychophysiological interaction analyses were conducted on functional magnetic resonance imaging data from a classic face/emotion perception task, with the bilateral amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex time-series as physiological regressors. Average parameter estimates (beta weights) of significant clusters were correlated with clinical outcomes at one week. RESULTS: Results showed decreased ventromedial prefrontal cortex-right amygdala functional connectivity during face processing post- (versus pre-) treatment; this decrease was associated with levels of rumination at one week. This effect was driven by connectivity changes in response to fearful and neutral (but not happy) faces. Independent whole-brain analyses also revealed a post-treatment increase in functional connectivity between the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex to occipital-parietal cortices during face processing. CONCLUSION: These results are consistent with the idea that psilocybin therapy revives emotional responsiveness on a neural and psychological level, which may be a key treatment mechanism for psychedelic therapy. Future larger placebo-controlled studies are needed to examine the replicability of the current findings.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"

The present study compared a combination of low-dose ketamine and dexmedetomidine (Ketodex) with a combination of low-dose ketamine and midazolam (Ketomid) on hemodynamic changes in electroshocks applied to patients referred from the psychiatric ward. Methodology: This study was a randomized triple-blind clinical trial performed after obtaining permission from the Medical Ethics Committee of the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. For this purpose, 70 patients were selected for electroshock therapy and randomly distributed into two groups of 35 people. In the first group, 0.04 mg/kg midazolam was combined with ketamine 0.1 mg/kg and in the second group, 0.5 μg/kg dexmedetomidine with 0.1 mg/kg ketamine. The patients were placed under complete cardiovascular monitoring. Hemodynamic changes of patients were measured and recorded before injection, after injection, after shock, and at 5 and 10 min after the end of seizures. Results: In this study, 70 patients who were candidates for receiving ECT were equally divided into two groups of 35: one group received a mixture of Ketodex and the second group a combination of Ketomid. The two study groups showed no significant difference in terms of systolic pressure (P = 0.883), diastolic (P = 0.443), mean arterial pressure (P = 0.443), oxygen saturation (P = 0.018), and heart rate (P = 0.286). Complications such as headache, muscular pain (P = 0.01), bradycardia, nausea and vomiting were reported in the dexmedetomidine and ketamine groups. Conclusion: Our study showed that although systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen saturation were significantly reduced in both study groups, no significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of hemodynamic changes and neither drug group in our study population was different from the other in terms of these parameters. In addition, neither option was superior to the other. However, due to the fact that complications such as headache, muscular pain, bradycardia, nausea and vomiting were reported in the dexmedetomidine and ketamine groups, the combination of midazolam and ketamine appeared to be a more appropriate combination in patients undergoing electroconvulsive therapy.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"6028","Pharmacological Interaction Between Doxazosin and Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA).^\n3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""ecstasy"") is widely used by young people for its euphoric effects. MDMA releases serotonin (5‐HT), dopamine, and norepinephrine (NE). NE release is thought to mediate the cardiovascular effects of MDMA and may also contribute to its psychostimulant effects. However, the functional role of adrenergic postsynaptic receptors in the cardiovascular and subjective effects of MDMA in humans is largely unclear. To determine the role of alpha‐adrenergic receptors in the response to MDMA in humans the investigators test the effects of the alpha1‐receptor blocker doxazosin on the physiological and subjective effects of MDMA. The investigators use a randomized double‐blind placebo‐controlled cross‐over design with four experimental sessions. doxazosin or placebo will be administered before MDMA or placebo to 16 healthy volunteers. Subjective and cardiovascular responses will be repeatedly assessed throughout the experiments and plasma samples are collected for pharmacokinetics. The primary hypothesis is that doxazosin will significantly reduce the blood pressure response to MDMA.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"6060","MDMA-assisted Psychotherapy for Anxiety Associated With a Life-threatening Illness.^\nIIndividuals facing, or who have faced, a life‐threatening illness contend with more than just the physical symptoms of their condition. Research suggests that diagnosis of, and living with a life‐threatening illness can result in symptoms similar to those seen in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). 3,‐4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a monoamine releaser with a unique pharmacological profile that include decreased feelings of fear, increased positive mood and increased interpersonal trust. Findings from clinical trials in people with PTSD and anecdotal reports suggest that MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy may assist people who are anxious as a result of facing a life‐threatening illness. This randomized, placebo‐controlled pilot study of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy in 18 people with anxiety stemming from a life‐threatening illness examines the safety and efficacy of this treatment. This study will allow comparison between the impact of placebo and an active dose of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy on anxiety, depression, sleep quality, global functioning, attitudes toward death, posttraumatic growth, mindfulness, self‐compassion, and overall quality of life. Participants must be people of either gender aged 18 years or older diagnosed with a life‐threatening cancer or non‐dementing neurological illness and anxiety resulting from confronting this illness. Eighteen participants will be enrolled in the study. Five of 18 participants will receive placebo and 13 will receive MDMA. Therapy will be conducted by male/female teams, some of whom will be experienced therapists, and the others will be intern therapists under supervision of the Principal Investigator. In the first study segment, Stage 1, all participants will have two blinded experimental sessions of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy scheduled at a two to four week interval, within a moderate course of non‐drug psychotherapy (preparatory and integrative sessions), after which they will complete the primary endpoint assessment. After the primary endpoint assessment, the subject and therapists will be unblinded and fully debriefed. Participants assigned to receive active dose MDMA will then receive a third open‐label experimental session with the same active dose of MDMA, which will complete Stage 1. Participants assigned to receive placebo will crossover, without completing Stage 1, to an open‐label study segment following similar procedures, referred to as Stage 2. Participants enrolled in this group will receive the same dose of MDMA as the active dose in Stage 1, with an optional supplemental half dose, at each of three experimental sessions at time points equivalent to those in Stage 1. Anxiety, depression, sleep quality, attitudes toward death, posttraumatic growth, mindfulness, self‐compassion, and overall quality of life will be assessed by participants' self‐report at baseline, the primary endpoint, and one month after the third experimental session in Stage 1, and at equivalent points in Stage 2. Additional assessments of depression and overall psychological functioning will be made by a blinded Independent Rater at these time points. A caregiver and individuals in close relationship to the study subject will also provide ratings of the subject's posttraumatic growth and mood. Symptoms, long‐term benefits, and harms will be assessed again at 6 months and 12 months after the final experimental session. This study will provide an estimate of effect size based on response of psychological symptoms to MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"

A wait‐list design includes a control group that is assigned to a waiting list to receive an intervention after the active treatment group does. In this study, the active group will receive the psilocybin at weeks 5 and 9 and the wait‐list control group will receive psilocybin at weeks 30 and 34. The wait‐list control group serves the purpose of providing an untreated comparison for the active treatment group, while at the same time allowing the wait‐list participants an opportunity to obtain the intervention at a later date. This study's procedures include screening, preparatory meetings, psilocybin sessions, and follow‐up assessments. A large battery of behavioral and psychological measures will be assessed throughout. The study team will consent and enroll up to 86 subjects to obtain a total of 12 completer participants as well as 2‐3 family members or friends per study participant who can assess said completers on the Observer Rating Form (COM‐R). This number will account for screen‐failures and dropouts as well. The 12 participants will be randomly assigned to either an immediate participation group (N=6) or a 6‐month delayed participation group (N=6). Although statistical power calculations show that 12 participants will be sufficient to detect the major effects anticipated in this study, the sponsor of this study (The Council on Spiritual Practices) is concurrently funding Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine to conduct a methodologically identical study with 12 additional participants (IND #59009). This will permit the two sites to collaborate post study completion and combine the data from the two studies to provide statistical power to detect even more subtle effects of the psilocybin intervention.

"6195","Psilocybin-facilitated Treatment for Chronic Pain.^\nParticipants will be randomized to two groups: Psilocybin or Active Placebo. Those in the Psilocybin condition will receive .36 mg/kg of psilocybin. Based on previous research, .36 mg/kg of psilocybin is expected to balance the intention to increase the probability of having a full mystical‐type experience against the odds of having a subjectively challenging psychological experience. Those in the Active Placebo condition will receive 2.6 mg/kg of dextromethorphan (DXM). DXM was selected as the placebo drug in the current study because its subjective and behavioral effects at higher doses can resemble those of classical hallucinogens. Participants will be blinded to what drug they are administered. Participants will be unblinded at the end of the study. Interested individuals who call research staff will undergo an initial telephone prescreen by a trained member of the research staff: the study aims, protocol, and any possible risks will be described and a series of questions will be asked to determine interest and eligibility for screening for the study. Initial eligibility may also be assessed via an online questionnaire through Qualtrics. Qualified participants will be scheduled for an in‐person screening. In‐person screening sessions will be conducted by the PI or trained research staff. Individuals will first undergo informed consent; the consent form will describe the necessary eligibility confirmation that takes place before proceeding with the full study. A physical examination, a detailed psychiatric interview, several self‐report questionnaires, and a detailed medical history will be completed at the screening session, which takes place at the UAB Clinical Research Unit. Participants will also have their blood drawn for screening tests. Study staff will provide participants with a hand‐held tablet device and instructions on how to complete the daily symptom questionnaire via the tablet. They will be asked to begin reporting daily symptoms on their tablet from home that evening. Eligible participants will be contacted by study staff by phone to inform them of their eligibility. All participants will undergo at least 2 weekly preparation sessions of approximately 2 hours each, with the possibility of 1‐2 additional weekly preparatory sessions per the discretion of the investigator. These sessions are to educate participants on the study protocol, psilocybin administration, and study treatment rationale. Participants will be randomly assigned in a double‐blind manner to the Psilocybin or Active Placebo group following their final preparation session. One week after the final preparation session, participants will be instructed to eat a low‐fat breakfast prior to presenting for their drug administration session at 8:00 am, approximately 1 hour before drug administration. A urine sample will be collected to verify drug‐free and non‐pregnant status and participants will be encouraged to relax and reflect before drug administration. The drug administration session will take place over the course of 8 hours. The guide and secondary monitor will be present with and monitor participants throughout this session (at least one individual will always be present with the participant, even during brief intervals when the guide or monitor may be using the restroom). Participants will be monitored for physical symptoms of distress and encouraged to report any symptoms experienced. Blood pressure will be assessed pre‐administration via automatic blood pressure monitor, and may also be assessed at 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, and 360 minutes post‐administration. Seven hours after drug administration, when the major drug effects have subsided, participants will complete questionnaires assessing their experience. Participants will then be released into the care of a friend or family member oriented to be emotionally supportive of the participant (as arranged during preparation sessions) and instructed not to drive an automobile or engage in any other potentially dangerous activity for the remainder f the day. Participants will be provided with the guide's contact information by phone should they feel the need for support that evening.

"6302","Using ketamine to model semantic deficits in schizophrenia.^\nSemantic deficits constitute a core cognitive abnormality in schizophrenia. In the current study, the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine was administered to healthy individuals acutely while they performed semantic processing tasks that included word pairs of differing degrees of semantic relatedness. Two dimensions of semantic processing were investigated: (1) explicit versus implicit processing, that is, unconscious versus conscious processing of semantic relationships and (2) direct versus indirect processing, that is, word pairs that are closely (LION-TIGER) or distantly (LION-STRIPES) related. The immediate effects of ketamine (0.8 mg/kg per hour during 80 minutes with approximate target plasma levels of 200 ng/mL) were examined in a placebo-controlled double-blind repeated-measures group design with 19 participants. It was predicted that ketamine would disrupt access to semantic memory as evidenced in schizophrenia, especially the indirectly related word pairs. In addition, implicit processing and explicit processing were predicted to be differentially affected. Ketamine administration did result in an abnormal performance in the reaction time responses to implicitly presented indirectly related word pairs (ie, greater priming) and reduced accuracy for explicit pairs. Performance on the directly related word pair tasks (both implicit and explicit) was similar across ketamine and placebo conditions, except for the suggestion of abnormal semantic matching in the accuracy data in the implicit task. This study confirms that implicit indirect semantic processing is changed under the influences of ketamine akin to schizophrenia. Future research comparing a schizophrenia group and a ketamine group directly about these tasks is needed to determine the similarity of impairments.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"6366","Features of dissociation differentially predict antidepressant response to ketamine in treatment-resistant depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine induces rapid and robust antidepressant effects, and many patients also describe dissociation, which is associated with antidepressant response. This follow-up study investigated whether antidepressant efficacy is uniquely related to dissociative symptom clusters. METHODS: Treatment-resistant patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder (BD) (n = 126) drawn from three studies received a single subanesthetic (0.5 mg/kg) ketamine infusion. Dissociative effects were measured using the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS). Antidepressant response was measured using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). A confirmatory factor analysis established the validity of CADSS subscales (derealization, depersonalization, amnesia), and a general linear model with repeated measures was fitted to test whether subscale scores were associated with antidepressant response. RESULTS: Factor validity was supported, with a root mean square error of approximation of .06, a comparative fit index of .97, and a Tucker-Lewis index of .96. Across all studies and timepoints, the depersonalization subscale was positively related to HAM-D percent change. A significant effect of derealization on HAM-D percent change was observed at one timepoint (Day 7) in one study. The amnesia subscale was unrelated to HAM-D percent change. LIMITATIONS: Possible inadequate blinding; combined MDD/BD datasets might have underrepresented ketamine's antidepressant efficacy; the possibility of Type I errors in secondary analyses. CONCLUSIONS: From a psychometric perspective, researchers may elect to administer only the CADSS depersonalization subscale, given that it was most closely related to antidepressant response. From a neurobiological perspective, mechanistic similarities may exist between ketamine-induced depersonalization and antidepressant response, although off-target effects cannot be excluded.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"

Animal experiments indicate that MDMA is a potent neurotoxin specifically affecting the serotonergic system. A few functional neuroimaging studies revealed central nervous alterations after the repeated use of ecstasy. We examined 94 ecstasy users in comparison to 27 control subjects by means of positron emission tomography (PET) with 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG). The FDG uptake rates were globally reduced in ecstasy users, most pronounced in the striatum. The uptake rates tended to be negatively correlated with the cumulative ecstasy doses. The results indicate that younger ecstasy users may be more vulnerable with regard to neurotoxicity.","[1, 1, 0, 0]"
"6496","Effects of low-dose ketamine on neuropathic pain: An electroencephalogram-electrooculogram/behavioral study.^\nThe aim of the present study was to clarify the neurophysiological changes associated with analgesic and behavioral effects of low-dose ketamine HCl in patients suffering from chronic neuropathic pain. Ten in-patients with neuropathic pain participated in this single-blind, placebo-controlled study after giving written informed consent. Following intravenous injections of a saline solution (placebo), three bolus injections of 5 mg ketamine HCl were administered at 5 min intervals. Changes in pain perception were assessed using a numerical rating scale for pain. Behavioral changes, including psychotomimetic effects, were assessed using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Electroencephalograms (EEG) and electrooculograms (EOG) were recorded continuously throughout the testing period. One minute EEG and closed-eye eye movements were quantified. The effects of ketamine were evaluated by comparing the neurophysiological and behavioral parameters obtained from the placebo and ketamine trials. Pain reduction was significantly correlated with ketamine-induced changes in hallucinatory behavior and excitement as measured by the BPRS. Ketamine injections caused a significant decrease in the EEGalpha amplitude without an accompanying reduction in EEG frequency. The EEGalpha amplitude reduction at the right central electrode was significantly related to subjective pain relief. Subanesthetic doses of ketamine significantly decreased rapid eye movements, but did not initiate slow eye movements. In conclusion, the present EEG-EOG/behavioral results indicate that ketamine-induced failure of neural integration between cortical-subcortical regions induces psychotic symptoms and alters pain perception on neuropathic pain.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"

However, in one of the volunteers, a faint color change appeared at 0 time, when plasma and urine tested negative for MDMA and did not disappear even 48 h later. Plasma concentrations of MDMA and HMMA measured by GC-MS peaked at 2-4 h, and values greater than 20 ng/mL for MDMA and of 40 ng/mL for HMMA were still detected at 24 h. Urine tested positive by GC-MS for MDMA and HMMA in the 48-h collection period. These findings preliminarily support sweat testing with Drugwipe for monitoring MDMA use.","[0, 1, 0, 0]"
"6684","Clinical experience using intranasal ketamine in the treatment of pediatric bipolar disorder/fear of harm phenotype.^\nOBJECTIVES: Intravenous ketamine, a glutamate N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, has been shown to exert a rapid antidepressant effect in adults with treatment resistant depression. Children with bipolar disorder (BD) often respond poorly to pharmacotherapy, including polypharmacy. A pediatric-onset Fear of Harm (FOH) phenotype has been described, and is characterized by severe clinical features and resistance to accepted treatments for BD. The potential efficacy and safety of intranasal ketamine in children with BD with FOH-phenotype were assessed by a systematic retrospective chart review of a case series from the private practice of one of the authors, including cases with clear refractoriness to mood stabilizers, antipsychotics and benzodiazepines. METHODS: A comparison was made between routinely collected symptom measures 1-2 weeks prior to and after the administration of ketamine, in 12 treatment-refractory youth, 10 males 2 females ages 6-19years. RESULTS: Ketamine administration was associated with a substantial reduction in measures of mania, fear of harm and aggression. Significant improvement was observed in mood, anxiety and behavioral symptoms, attention/executive functions, insomnia, parasomnias and sleep inertia. Treatment was generally well-tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Intranasal ketamine administration in treatment-resistant youth with BD-FOH produced marked improvement in all symptomatic dimensions. A rapid, substantial therapeutic response, with only minimal side effects was observed. Formal clinical trials to assess safety and efficacy are warranted.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"6740","The effects of a subanesthetic dose of ketamine on verbal memory in normal volunteers.^\nRATIONALE: N-methyl-D: -aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonists have been reported to induce schizophrenia-like symptoms in humans, including memory impairments. Although the NMDA receptor has been shown to impair memory acquisition by disrupting long-term potentiation (LTP), limited research has been done on studying the effects of NMDA antagonists on the post-LTP cascade of events implicated in consolidation as measured by administering the drug after the initial learning experience. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this experiment was to examine the effect of ketamine on mental status and to identify NMDA antagonist-induced memory deficits by comparing the recall performance of items presented both immediately before and during ketamine infusion. METHODS: Thirteen normal controls received a 60-min infusion of ketamine in a randomized double-blind, cross-over design. Mental status was evaluated with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale. The first 12-item word list was presented immediately before infusion, and two lists were subsequently presented during the infusion. Verbal memory performance was assessed by measuring the delayed cued recall of each list 30 min after its presentation. RESULTS: At the beginning, subjects experienced perceptual and reality distortion symptoms, followed later by mild subjective effects. Ketamine significantly reduced the delayed recall of words presented immediately before, but not during, drug infusion. Ketamine-induced decrements in verbal recall correlated significantly with plasma ketamine levels. CONCLUSION: This study characterizes the behavioral effects associated with ketamine and suggests that ketamine decreases verbal memory performance by interfering with early consolidation processes.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"6914","Is moderate substance use associated with altered executive functioning in a population-based sample of young adults?.^\nBackground: Substance use (SU) has been linked with impaired cognitive functioning. Evidence comes mainly from clinical studies or studies examining heavy users. Though, the majority of users are not involved in heavy use. This study investigates the association between moderate use and cognition in a population-based sample. Methods: A total of 284 young adults with ecstasy, cannabis or alcohol use and a control group were sampled from the EDSP database for participation in the Munich Assessment of Young Adults (MAYA) study. Subjects completed a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests (executive functions, working memory and impulsivity). Multiple linear regression models were conducted to examine the relationship between use and cognitive performance. Results: Increased ecstasy consumption was associated with increased error-proneness (Stroop task, CANTAB ID/ED-shift, spatial working memory). More frequent cannabis use and more extensive alcohol consumption were associated with a higher degree of impulsiveness. Conclusions: Based on mild to moderate SU, little indication of differences in executive functioning was found. For ecstasy use, an increased error-proneness was revealed. The subtle differences in relatively young individuals warrant further investigation in prospective long-term studies to identify subjects at risk, and to examine effects of prolonged patterns of use on executive functioning.

"7055","Psilocybin Induces Time-Dependent Changes in Global Functional Connectivity.^\nBACKGROUND: The use of psilocybin in scientific and experimental clinical contexts has triggered renewed interest in the mechanism of action of psychedelics. However, its time-dependent systems-level neurobiology remains sparsely investigated in humans. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, counterbalanced, crossover study comprising 23 healthy human participants who received placebo and 0.2 mg/kg of psilocybin orally on 2 different test days. Participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging at 3 time points between administration and peak effects: 20 minutes, 40 minutes, and 70 minutes after administration. Resting-state functional connectivity was quantified via a data-driven global brain connectivity method and compared with cortical gene expression maps. RESULTS: Psilocybin reduced associative, but concurrently increased sensory, brain-wide connectivity. This pattern emerged over time from administration to peak effects. Furthermore, we showed that baseline connectivity is associated with the extent of psilocybin-induced changes in functional connectivity. Lastly, psilocybin-induced changes correlated in a time-dependent manner with spatial gene expression patterns of the 5-HT(2A) (5-hydroxytryptamine 2A) and 5-HT(1A) (5-hydroxytryptamine 1A) receptors. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the integration of functional connectivity in sensory regions and the disintegration in associative regions may underlie the psychedelic state and pinpoint the critical role of the serotonin 2A and 1A receptor systems. Furthermore, baseline connectivity may represent a predictive marker of the magnitude of changes induced by psilocybin and may therefore contribute to a personalized medicine approach within the potential framework of psychedelic treatment.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"7077","Effects of intravenous ketamine on explicit and implicit measures of suicidality in treatment-resistant depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Intravenous ketamine has shown rapid antidepressant effects in early trials, making it a potentially attractive candidate for depressed patients at imminent risk of suicide. The Implicit Association Test (IAT), a performance-based measure of association between concepts, may have utility in suicide assessment. METHODS: Twenty-six patients with treatment-resistant depression were assessed using the suicidality item of the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-SI) 2 hours before and 24 hours following a single subanesthetic dose of intravenous ketamine. Ten patients also completed IATs assessing implicit suicidal associations at comparable time points. In a second study, nine patients received thrice-weekly ketamine infusions over a 12-day period. RESULTS: Twenty-four hours after a single infusion, MADRS-SI scores were reduced on average by 2.08 points on a 0 to 6 scale (p < .001; d = 1.37), and 81% of patients received a rating of 0 or 1 postinfusion. Implicit suicidal associations were also reduced following ketamine (p = .003; d = 1.36), with reductions correlated across implicit and explicit measures. MADRS-SI reductions were sustained for 12 days by repeated-dose ketamine (p < .001; d = 2.42). CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings support the premise that ketamine has rapid beneficial effects on suicidal cognition and warrants further study.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"7379","Serotonergic hallucinogens and recognition of facial emotion expressions: a systematic review of the literature.^\nBACKGROUND: Recognition of emotions in facial expressions (REFE) is a key aspect of social cognition. Anxiety and mood disorders are associated with deficits in REFE, and anxiolytics and antidepressants reverse these deficits. Recent studies have shown that serotonergic hallucinogens (i.e. ayahuasca, dimethyltryptamine, psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide [LSD], and mescaline) have anxiolytic and antidepressant properties, but their effects on REFE are not well understood. The purpose of the study was to conduct a systematic review analyzing the effects of serotonergic hallucinogens on REFE in humans. METHODS: Studies published in the PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases until 19 October 2018 which analyzed the effects of serotonergic hallucinogens on REFE in humans were included. RESULTS: Of the 62 studies identified, 8 studies were included. Included studies involved the administration of a single or a few doses of LSD or psilocybin, and most trials were randomized and controlled with placebo. LSD and psilocybin reduced the recognition of negative emotions in most studies and modulated amygdala activity to these stimuli, which was correlated with antidepressive effects in patients. Both drugs were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Serotonergic hallucinogens reduced the recognition of negative emotions by modulating amygdala activity. Despite the small sample sizes, results suggest that serotonergic hallucinogens show promising beneficial effects on deficits in REFE.","[0, 0, 0, 1]"
"7601","MDMA (Ecstasy) association with impaired fMRI BOLD thalamic coherence and functional connectivity.^\nBACKGROUND: MDMA exposure is associated with chronic serotonergic dysfunction in preclinical and clinical studies. A recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) comparison of past MDMA users to non-MDMA-using controls revealed increased spatial extent and amplitude of activation in the supplementary motor area during motor tasks (Karageorgiou et al., 2009). Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) data from that study were reanalyzed for intraregional coherence and for inter-regional temporal correlations between time series, as functional connectivity. METHODS: Fourteen MDMA users and ten controls reporting similar non-MDMA abuse performed finger taps during fMRI. Fourteen motor pathway regions plus a pontine raphé region were examined. Coherence was expressed as percent of voxels positively correlated with an intraregional index voxel. Functional connectivity was determined using wavelet correlations. RESULTS: Intraregional thalamic coherence was significantly diminished at low frequencies in MDMA users compared to controls (p=0.009). Inter-regional functional connectivity was significantly weaker for right thalamo - left caudate (p=0.002), right thalamo - left thalamus (p=0.007), right caudate - right postcentral (p=0.007) and right supplementary motor area - right precentral gyrus (p=0.011) region pairs compared to controls. When stratified by lifetime exposure, significant negative associations were observed between cumulative MDMA use and functional connectivity in seven other region-pairs, while only one region-pair showed a positive association. CONCLUSIONS: Reported prior MDMA use was associated with deficits in BOLD intraregional coherence and inter-regional functional connectivity, even among functionally robust pathways involving motor regions. This suggests that MDMA use is associated with long-lasting effects on brain neurophysiology beyond the cognitive domain.","[1, 1, 0, 0]"
"8089","Psilocybin-assisted therapy for major depressive disorder: An exploratory placebo-controlled, fixed-order trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Several early phase studies have demonstrated that psilocybin-assisted therapy has rapid-acting and persisting antidepressant effects from just one or two doses. However, methodological limitations (e.g., placebo-control, blinding) limit interpretability of the existing literature. METHODS: In an exploratory placebo-controlled, within-subject, fixed-order study, individuals with moderate to severe major depressive disorder were administered placebo (n = 19) followed by psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg) (n = 15) 4 weeks later. Dosing sessions were embedded within an manualized course of psychotherapy. Enhanced blinding procedures were used. Depression, anxiety, and quality of life were measured over a 16-week study period. RESULTS: Depression and anxiety significantly improved following both placebo and psilocybin with no significant difference in the degree of change between the two conditions. However, antidepressant effect sizes were larger after psilocybin (d' = 1.02-2.27) than after placebo (d' = 0.65-0.99) and there were high rates of response (66.7%) and remission (46.7%) following psilocybin administration. Antidepressant effects following psilocybin persisted, on average, for 2 months and there were persisting improvements in mood-related quality of life domains. The strength of mystical-type experience during psilocybin dosing was not correlated with subsequent antidepressant effects. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this exploratory study highlight the complex interplay between expectancy, therapy effects, and drug/placebo effects in psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy studies. Nonetheless, the acute and persisting clinical improvements observed following psilocybin support further study of its potential in the treatment of major depression. Future studies should more explicitly mitigate and measure expectancy effects and assess the impact of repeated dosing and different forms of psychotherapeutic support.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"8101","P300-mediated modulations in self-other processing under psychedelic psilocybin are related to connectedness and changed meaning: A window into the self-other overlap.^\nThe concept of self and self-referential processing has a growing explanatory value in psychiatry and neuroscience, referring to the cognitive organization and perceptual differentiation of self-stimuli in health and disease. Conditions in which selfhood loses its natural coherence offer a unique opportunity for elucidating the mechanisms underlying self-disturbances. We assessed the psychoactive effects of psilocybin (230 μg/kg p.o.), a preferential 5-HT1A/2A agonist known to induce shifts in self-perception. Our placebo-controlled, double-blind, within-subject crossover experiment (n = 17) implemented a verbal self-monitoring task involving vocalizations and participant identification of real-time auditory source- (self/other) and pitch-modulating feedback. Subjective experience and task performance were analyzed, with time-point-by-time-point assumption-free multivariate randomization statistics applied to the spatiotemporal dynamics of event-related potentials. Psilocybin-modulated self-experience, interacted with source to affect task accuracy, and altered the late phase of self-stimuli encoding by abolishing the distinctiveness of self- and other-related electric field configurations during the P300 timeframe. This last effect was driven by current source density changes within the supragenual anterior cingulate and right insular cortex. The extent of the P300 effect was associated with the intensity of psilocybin-induced feelings of unity and changed meaning of percepts. Modulations of late encoding and their underlying neural generators in self-referential processing networks via 5-HT signaling may be key for understanding self-disorders. This mechanism may reflect a neural instantiation of altered self-other and relational meaning processing in a stimulus-locked time domain. The study elucidates the neuropharmacological foundation of subjectivity, with implications for therapy, underscoring the concept of connectedness.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"8138","Attributions for psychobiological changes in ecstasy/MDMA and other polydrug users.^\nEcstasy [3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)] use has been associated with a number of psychopathological problems. However, research suggests that reported symptoms might be associated more with heavy polydrug use in general rather than ecstasy per se. The current study aimed to determine the role of other drug use in reports of long-term effects by some ecstasy-polydrug users. Problematic ecstasy users (n = 53), reporting problems which they attributed to ecstasy use, were compared with non-problematic ecstasy users (n = 62), polydrug (n = 62) and alcohol/nicotine using controls (n = 111). Drug use was recorded, and positive and negative life changes were assessed along with which previous drug use, if any, they attributed these changes too. Both ecstasy groups reported higher drug use compared with polydrug controls. Polydrug and ecstasy users more often reported life changes compared with non-drug users, and ecstasy users appeared to experience more life changes than polydrug users, with problematic ecstasy users experiencing most alterations. Ecstasy users reported changes more to a combination of drugs than to one specific drug, suggesting that polydrug use in these groups has an impact on their life experiences. These findings emphasise that research into the psychological effects of ecstasy should not underestimate the role of other polydrug use. © 2009 British Association for Psychopharmacology.","[1, 1, 0, 0]"
"8263","Young adult ecstasy use patterns: Quantities and combinations.^\nThe objectives of this paper are to describe ecstasy use patterns among young adult (18-25 years) users and to compare use patterns and self-reported effects according to the frequency (number of days used in the last 90 days) and intensity (typical number of pills taken per sitting) of ecstasy use. Computer-assisted structured interviews were conducted with 261 young adult active ecstasy users in Atlanta, Georgia. A typical dose of ecstasy intake was two pills, often followed by a booster dose. In addition, binging on ecstasy was reported. Ecstasy was mentioned as the primary drug of choice by one fifth of respondents. Poly-drug use dominated, and a substantial proportion of the respondents reported symptoms of ecstasy dependence. Differences in sociodemographic characteristics, poly-drug use, and reported effects of ecstasy use were found according to frequency and intensity of ecstasy use. Findings from this paper are important for the development of effective prevention efforts, including drug treatment and policy. © 2006 by the Journal of Drug Issues.","[0, 1, 0, 0]"
"8836","Efficacy and Safety of a Rapid Intravenous Injection of Ketamine 0.5 mg/kg in Treatment-Resistant Major Depression: An Open 4-Week Longitudinal Study.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine has been documented for its rapid antidepressant effects. However, optimal dose and delivery route have not yet been thoroughly investigated. The objectives of this study were to document the safety and test the antidepressant and antisuicidal effects of a single rapid 1-minute injection of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). METHODS: Ten patients with TRD were included in an open, noncontrolled 4-week study and received a rapid intravenous dose of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg. Main outcome measure was the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale and suicidality was assessed using the Scale for Suicide Ideation. RESULTS: Rapid injection of ketamine elicited transient increase of blood pressure and altered states of consciousness in all patients and mild psychotomimetic effects in 4 patients, which all resolved without any intervention. Decrease of depression severity was observed from 40-minute postinjection until day 15. Eight patients became responders within 1 day and all were nonresponders after 4 weeks. The decrease of suicidal ideation was significant until day 7. Analysis indicated that higher severity of depression and anxiety at baseline predicted a larger Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale decrease after 4 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that in well-controlled medical settings with adequate monitoring, a single rapid 1-minute injection of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg can be well tolerated and is efficacious in rapidly reducing depression symptoms and suicidal thoughts in outpatients with TRD. These findings are relevant to the practice of general clinical psychiatry and emergency departments were ketamine can have a place in acute management of TRD. Larger studies are necessary to confirm these results.","[0, 0, 1, 0]"
"9119","A systematic review of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy for mental health: An evaluation of the current wave of research and suggestions for the future.^\nResearch on psychedelics has seen a recent revival, with many clinical trials focused on their therapeutic potential to treat a range of mental health conditions. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate clinical trials of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy for mental health conditions from the present wave of psychedelic research (1990s to present). A total of 43 studies met criteria and were included. The conditions reviewed were substance use disorders; anxiety and/or depression, often associated with terminal illness; posttraumatic stress disorder; and obsessive–compulsive disorder. Quantitative results indicate that psychedelics can significantly reduce clinical outcomes associated with these mental health conditions. Common themes identified from qualitative reports included increased acceptance and processing of emotions, connectedness to others, forgiveness, self-compassion, insights into the self, peak or mystical experiences, ego dissolution, positive changes in worldview, motivation and commitment to change, changes in the relationship to the substance of abuse for those with substance use disorder, and acceptance of death for those with terminal illness. No serious, long-term adverse events were reported directly attributable to drug ingestion. We discuss the strengths and limitations of the research base, along with suggestions for clinical practice, potential therapeutic mechanisms, and directions for future research. Despite promising results, further work is needed to determine which psychedelic is best suited for diverse mental health conditions, the most appropriate type of psychotherapy to employ, and the psychological and neurobiological mechanisms underlying clinical benefits.

"9198","Longitudinal Course of Adverse Events With Esketamine Nasal Spray: A Post Hoc Analysis of Pooled Data From Phase 3 Trials in Patients With Treatment-Resistant Depression.^\nObjective: To describe the tolerability of esketamine nasal spray based on the adverse event profile observed during treatment sessions occurring early and later over the course of treatment. Methods: In 2 long-term, phase 3 studies (NCT02493868, October 1, 2015-February 16, 2018; NCT02497287, September 30, 2015-October 28, 2017), patients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (per DSM-5) and nonresponse to ≥ 2 oral antidepressants received esketamine nasal spray (56 or 84 mg) twice weekly during a 4-week induction phase, weekly for weeks 5-8, and weekly or every 2 weeks thereafter as maintenance treatment, in conjunction with a new oral antidepressant. A post hoc analysis using descriptive statistics evaluated occurrence (incidence, frequency, severity) and recurrence (incidence and severity) of events of specific interest. Results: In patients treated with esketamine nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant (n = 928), spontaneously reported adverse events of dizziness, nausea, sedation, vertigo, and increased blood pressure were more likely to recur after the first week of treatment if they occurred more frequently (twice > once > none) during the first week. The same pattern was observed when these events were assessed by structured instruments. Incidences of dizziness, dissociation, increased blood pressure, nausea, vertigo, and sedation were highest in week 1 of treatment (20.6%, 16.7%, 4.3%, 14.0%, 12.1%, and 3.8%, respectively) and decreased thereafter. Initial occurrences and subsequent recurrences of events were mostly mild or moderate in severity. Conclusions: Adverse events during treatment with esketamine nasal spray plus an oral antidepressant generally become less frequent with ongoing treatment, and the majority are mild or moderate in severity.

"9374","Past-year hallucinogen use in relation to psychological distress, depression, and suicidality among US adults.^\nBackground: There is renewed interest in the clinical application of hallucinogenic substances to treat a range of psychiatric conditions. However, there is mixed evidence regarding how use of such substances outside of medical settings relates to psychological distress, depression, and suicidality. Methods: We examined data from a US representative sample of noninstitutionalized adults from the 2015–2020 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (N = 241,675). We evaluated whether past-year use of specific hallucinogens (i.e., LSD, DMT/AMT/Foxy, salvia divinorum, ecstasy [MDMA/Molly], ketamine) is associated with reporting past-year serious psychological distress (SPD), major depressive episode (MDE), and suicidality. Generalized linear models using Poisson and log link were used to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs), controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and past-year use of various other illegal drugs. Results: LSD use was associated with an increased likelihood of MDE (aPR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.10–1.37) and suicidal thinking (aPR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.09–1.34). Similar associations were observed between salvia divinorum use and suicidal thinking (aPR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.00–1.97) and between DMT/AMT/Foxy use and suicidal planning (aPR = 1.81 95% CI: 1.17–2.81). On the other hand, ecstasy use was associated with a decreased likelihood of SPD (aPR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.77–0.89), MDE (aPR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.83–1.00), and suicidal thinking (aPR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.75–0.99). Conclusion: Findings suggest there are differences among specific hallucinogens with respect to depression and suicidality. More research is warranted to understand consequences of and risk factors for hallucinogen use outside of medical settings among adults experiencing depression or suicidality.","[0, 1, 0, 0]"
"9419","Cognitive and motor effects of NMDA antagonist ketamine in healthy individuals with a family history of alcoholism.^\nThe cognitive and motor effects of alcohol drinking are influenced by a family history of alcoholism. Some data suggest that individuals with a family history of alcoholism(family history positive [FHP]) are less affected and intoxicated by alcohol, as compared to those without such a history (family history negative [FHN]). Our group has used ketamine as a pharmacological probe to study alcoholism, since (a) both alcohol and ketamine inhibit N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor function and (b) ketamine has alcohol‐like effects. The purpose of the study was to evaluate cognitive and motor effects of ketamine in FHP and FHN subjects. Ninety‐nine non‐alcohol‐dependent healthy subjects with (FHP; n = 29) and without a family history of alcoholism(FHN; n = 70) were recruited. The subjects weremales and females aged 21 to 30 years who had no lifetime Axis I psychiatric or substance use disorders. In this randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, crossover study, subjects received either intravenous ketamine (0.81 mg/kg) or placebo (saline) during two separate test sessions scheduled 3 days apart. Cognitive function was evaluated by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test. Motor coordination function was evaluated by the Grooved Pegboard Test. During the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, ketamine impaired both total recall (medication effect: p < 0.0001) and delayed recall (medication effect: p < 0.0001) compared with placebo. There was a statistical trend (family history x medication effect: p = 0.0667) showing that FHP subjects (placebo: 10.3; ketamine: 7.7) were less impaired than FHN subjects (placebo: 10.2; ketamine: 6.2) in delayed recall after ketamine infusion. During the Grooved Pegboard Test, ketamine impaired motor coordination in both dominant hand (medication x time effect: p < 0.0001) and non‐dominant hand (medication x time effect: p < 0.0001) compared with placebo. There was a statistical trend (family history x medication x time effect: p = 0.0596) showing that FHP subjects (pre‐ketamine: 59.8 sec; post‐ketamine: 81.8 sec) were less impaired than FHN subjects (pre‐ketamine: 59.5 sec; post‐ketamine: 92.9 sec) in motor coordination performance after ketamine infusion (in dominant hand). In summary, our findings using ketamine as a pharmacological probe suggest that FHP subjects may be less sensitive to the cognitive and motor effects of alcohol compared to FHN subjects.","[1, 0, 0, 0]"
