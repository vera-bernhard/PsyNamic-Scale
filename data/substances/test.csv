"2483","Semantic activation in LSD: evidence from picture naming.^\nLysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a classic psychedelic drug that alters cognition in a characteristic way. It has been suggested that psychedelics expand the breadth of cognition via actions on the central nervous system. Previous work has shown changes in semantic processing under psilocybin (a related psychedelic to LSD) that are consistent with an increased spread of semantic activation. The present study investigates this further using a picture-naming task and the psychedelic, LSD. Ten participants completed the task under placebo and LSD. Results revealed significant effects of LSD on accuracy and error correction that were consistent with an increased spread of semantic activation under LSD. These results are consistent with a generalised “entropic” effect on the mind. We suggest incorporating direct neuroimaging measures in future studies, and to employ more naturalistic measures of semantic processing that may enhance ecological validity.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"3371","The effects of sub-anaesthetic doses of ketamine on memory, cognitive performance and subjective experience in healthy volunteers.^\nExamined cognitive and subjective effects of subanesthetic doses of ketamine on 12 healthy volunteers. Ss received 25 mg ketamine, 10 mg ketamine and saline placebo, intramuscular/ly (im) in a double-blind, Latin square design. A cognitive, perceptual and self-report test battery was administered over 45 min. The order of tests was rotated to control for timing effects. Ketamine (25 mg) significantly affected verbal learning and memory, parallel visual search, some measures of psychomotor performance, measures of arousal, subjective mood ratings and visual perception. Measures of attention and frontal lobe functioning were relatively unaffected. Thus, low doses of ketamine had selective, dose-related effects on memory, perceptual and psychomotor functions. The disruption of memory and perceptual processes may help to explain the unique subjective state induced by ketamine.

"5968","Effect of esketamine nasal spray on depressive symptoms in adults with severe major depressive disorder: a post hoc analysis of the aspire i and aspire ii studies.^\nBackground: ASPIRE I and ASPIRE II were 2 identically designed, global, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled phase 3 studies (NCT03039192, NCT03097133) designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of esketamine (ESK) nasal spray vs placebo (PBO) nasal spray, given in the context of comprehensive standard of care (SoC; ie, hospitalization, initiation, or optimization of antidepressant therapy), in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) who had active suicidal ideation with intent. These studies were the basis for the recent approval of ESK for the treatment of depressive symptoms in adults with MDD with acute suicidal ideation or behavior. To further understand the rapid effect of ESK +SoC vs PBO+SoC on depressive symptoms in patients with severe depression at baseline, we conducted a post hoc analysis of pooled data from ASPIRE I and ASPIRE II to examine changes in Montgomery‐Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total scores and Clinical Global Impression‐Severity of Suicidality‐Revised (CGI‐SS‐r) scores after ESK treatment. Methods: The ASPIRE I and II trials enrolled adults aged 18‐64 years with MDD confirmed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview and a minimum total MADRS score of >28 at baseline. Patients were randomized 1:1 to ESK 84 mg or PBO nasal spray twice weekly plus comprehensive SoC antidepressant treatment for 4 weeks. For this post hoc analysis, a subset of trial patients was identified as having severe depression per baseline total MADRS score >34 (Snaith Br J Psychiatry 1986). Change in MADRS total score was calculated from baseline to 4 hours post‐first dose, 24 hours post‐first dose, and predose on day 25 (ie, last day of double‐blind treatment phase). Differences between least squares mean (LSM) changes from baseline between groups in MADRS total score were examined using a mixed model for repeated measures. Percentages of subjects achieving response (ie, change in MADRS total score ≥50%) and remission (ie, MADRS total score ≤12) were also assessed using Cochran‐Mantel‐Haenszel tests. Generalized estimation equations were used to determine the relative odds of achieving a clinically meaningful improvement on the CGI‐SS‐r (≥1‐point decrease) scale with ESK+SoC vs PBO+SoC. A multiplicity adjustment procedure was not carried out. Results: Of 450 patients enrolled in the trials, 370 (82.2%) had severe MDD at baseline, as defined by MADRS score, and were included in this post hoc analysis (n=189, ESK+SoC; n=181, PBO +SoC). Demographic and psychiatric characteristics were similar between ESK+SoC and PBO+SoC groups at baseline (mean age: 40.3; 61.4% female). Mean (SD) MADRS total scores were 41.9 (4.62) and 42.5 (4.64), respectively. The ESK+SoC group had significantly greater decreases from baseline in MADRS total score vs the PBO+SoC group at 4 hours post‐first dose (‐12.6 vs ‐8.6; LSM difference [95% CI] ‐4.0 [‐5.9, ‐2.1]; P<0.001), at 24 hourspost‐first dose (‐16.4 vs ‐11.7; LSM difference [95% CI] ‐4.7 [‐6.9, ‐2.5]; P<0.001), and on day 25 (‐26.0 vs ‐22.8; LSM difference [95% CI] ‐3.2 [‐5.8, ‐0.7]; P=0.013). Significantly more patients in the ESK+SoC group vs PBO+SoC group attained response at 4 hours post‐first dose (24.5% vs 11.1%; P<0.001), at 24 hours post‐first dose (34.8% vs 22.4%; P=0.009), and on day 25 (76.7% vs 58.3%; P<0.001). The percentages of patients who attained remission were also greater in the ESK+SoC group vs PBO+SoC group at 4 hours post‐first dose (8.5% vs 2.8%; P=0.017), at 24 hours post‐first dose (18.2% vs 6.7%; P<0.001), and on day 25 (51.3% vs 36.1%; P=0.008). Patients in the ESK+SoC group were 78% more likely to experience a ≥1‐point decrease in CGI‐SS‐r score at 4 hours post‐first dose (odds ratio [95% CI] 1.78 [1.15, 2.74]; P=0.009) and 99% more likely at 24 hours post‐first dose (odds ratio [95% CI] 199 [1.24, 3.20]; P=0.005] than patients in the PBO+SoC group. Conclusions: Similar to findings from the ASPIRE global phase 3 clinical trial program to assess e ficacy of ESK+SoC vs PBO+SoC in reducing depressive symptoms in adults with moderate to severe MDD and suicidal ideation with intent, patients with severe MDD, as defined by MADRS total score >34, demonstrated significant improvement in depressive symptoms when treated with ESK +SoC compared with PBO+SoC as early as 4 hours after the first ESK dose. Improvements in depressive symptoms continued in favor of ESK+SoC treatment through study end of the doubleblind treatment phase. Additional analyses will be conducted to assess efficacy outcomes in patients with severe MDD defined through other validated instruments. ESK+SoC may provide an effective treatment of depressive symptoms with continued significant benefit for this population with challenging‐to‐treat depression. Reference: Snaith RP et al.

"748","Assessing the risk-benefit profile of classical psychedelics: a clinical review of second-wave psychedelic research.^\nRATIONALE: A broad reassessment of the potential benefits of psychedelic drugs has led to the initiation of multiple major clinical trials in an effort to advance their status to become FDA-approved medications, as well as local legislative efforts to legalize or decriminalize their use. OBJECTIVES: To use recently published data to assess potential risks and benefits of psychedelic drugs as therapeutics, as well as to synthesize what is currently known in order to generate fruitful future research directions. METHODS: A review of studies conducted since 1991 identified 14 clinical trials of classical psychedelics, including 11 of psilocybin (N = 257 participants), 1 of lysergic acid diethylamide (N = 12 participants), and 2 of ayahuasca (N = 46 participants). Other published studies (e.g., of healthy volunteers, survey studies, case reports, neuroimaging) were also considered for review. RESULTS: Published studies since 1991 largely support the hypothesis that small numbers of treatments with psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy can offer significant and sustained alleviation to symptoms of multiple psychiatric conditions. No serious adverse events attributed to psychedelic therapy have been reported. Existing studies have several limitations, including small sample sizes, inherent difficulty in blinding, relatively limited follow-up, and highly screened treatment populations. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial data have been gathered in the past 30 years suggesting that psychedelics are a potent treatment for a variety of common psychiatric conditions, though the ideal means of employing these substances to minimize adverse events and maximize therapeutic effects remains controversial. Unique factors related to study design are vital for clinical researchers in the field to address.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"1825","Selective augmentation of striatal functional connectivity following NMDA receptor antagonism: Implications for psychosis.^\nThe psychotomimetic effect of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist ketamine is thought to arise from a functional modulation of the brain's fronto-striato-thalamic (FST) circuits. Animal models suggest a pronounced effect on ventral 'limbic' FST systems, although recent work in patients with psychosis and high-risk individuals suggests specific alterations of dorsal 'associative' FST circuits. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the effects of a subanesthetic dose of ketamine on measures of functional connectivity as indexed by the temporal coherence of spontaneous neural activity in both dorsal and ventral FST circuits, as well as their symptom correlates. We adopted a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, repeated-measures design in which 19 healthy participants received either an intravenous saline infusion or a racemic mixture of ketamine (100 ng/ml) separated by at least I week Compared with placebo, ketamine increased functional connectivity between the dorsal caudate and both the thalamus and midbrain bilaterally. Ketamine additionally increased functional connectivity of the ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Both connectivity increases significantly correlated with the psychosis-like and dissociative symptoms under ketamine. Importantly, dorsal caudate connectivity with the ventrolateral thalamus and subthalamic nucleus showed inverse correlation with ketamine-induced symptomatology, pointing to a possible resilience role to disturbances in FST circuits. Although consistent with the role of FST in mediating psychosis, these findings contrast with previous research in clinical samples by suggesting that acute NMDAR antagonism may lead to psychosis-like experiences via a mechanism that is distinct from that implicated in frank psychotic illness.

"2482","Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of low dose lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in healthy older volunteers.^\nResearch has shown that psychedelics, such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), have profound anti-inflammatory properties mediated by 5-HT(2A) receptor signaling, supporting their evaluation as a therapeutic for neuroinflammation associated with neurodegenerative disease. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of orally repeated administration of 5 μg, 10 μg, and 20 μg LSD in older healthy individuals. In the current paper, we present safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic measures that relate to safety, tolerability, and dose response. METHODS: This was a phase 1 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study. Volunteers were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 dose groups (5 μg, 10 μg, 20 μg LSD, and placebo), and received their assigned dose on six occasions (i.e., every 4 days). RESULTS: Forty-eight older healthy volunteers (mean age = 62.9 years) received placebo (n = 12), 5 μg (n = 12), 10 μg (n = 12), or 20 μg (n = 12) LSD. LSD plasma levels were undetectable for the 5 μg group and peak blood plasma levels for the 10 μg and 20 μg groups occurred at 30 min. LSD was well tolerated, and the frequency of adverse events was no higher than for placebo. Assessments of cognition, balance, and proprioception revealed no impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest safety and tolerability of orally administered 5 μg, 10 μg, and 20 μg LSD every fourth day over a 21-day period and support further clinical development of LSD for the treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD).","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"2830","No difference in brain activation during cognitive performance between ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) users and control subjects: A [H215O]-positron emission tomography study.^\nThe long-term use of the serotonin-releaser and uptake-inhibitor 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""Ecstasy"") has been associated with memory impairments and increased liability to depressive mood and anxiety attacks. It is unclear, however, whether these psychologic deviations are reflected in alterations of the underlying neurophysiologic substrate. The authors compared mood and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) profiles between regular polytoxic Ecstasy users and Ecstasy-naïve controls. Brain activity as indexed by rCBF was measured during cognitive activation by an attentional task using positron emission tomography and [H215O]. Mood was assessed by means of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and the EWL Mood Rating Scale. Statistical parametric mapping revealed that brain activity did not differ between the two groups. Both groups also performed equally on the cognitive task requiring sustained attention. However, significantly higher levels of depressiveness as determined by the HAM-D and EWL scales were found in Ecstasy-using subjects. These data indicate that, despite differences in mood, polytoxic Ecstasy users do not differ from Ecstasy-naïve controls in terms of local brain activity. Heightened depressiveness in the Ecstasy group was consistent with results from previous studies and could be related to serotonergic hypofunction resulting from repeated MDMA consumption. However, this study cannot exclude the possibility that the observed differences are preexisting rather than a result of Ecstasy use.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"5738","The Effects of MDMA and Methamphetamine on Feelings of Closeness and Connection During Semi-Structured Conversations With Strangers.^\nBackground: MDMA is classified as an “empathogenic” drug, as it increases feelings of empathy and closeness to others. These effects are thought to be partly mediated by increased oxytocin release via enhanced serotonergic transmission. Despite its prosocial effects, few studies in humans have examined MDMA in the context of interpersonal interactions. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of MDMA on feelings of closeness and connection during a semi‐structured dyadic conversation, and to investigate the relations between feelings of closeness and oxytocin levels. To investigate pharmacological specificity, a separate group of subjects was tested with the prototypic stimulant methamphetamine. Methods: Two studies were conducted in separate sets of healthy volunteers. In within‐subject, double‐blind, placebocontrolled designs, subjects aged 18‐35 received a single dose of MDMA (100 mg) or placebo (Study 1; n = 18), or a single dose of methamphetamine (20 mg) or placebo (Study 2; n = 19), during two in‐lab sessions separated by 72 hours. During peak drug effect, they engaged in a 45 min semi‐structured conversation with a novel same‐sex partner. Subjective mood, physiological, and oxytocin levels were obtained at regular intervals, and subjects rated feelings of closeness and connection with their partners at the end of each session and one week later. Results: Both MDMA and methamphetamine increased ratings of feeling connected to the partner, and increased ratings of enjoyment and meaningfulness of the conversation, relative to placebo (Study 1 MDMA; p=0.009 and Study 2 methamphetamine p=0.01). Both MDMA and methamphetamine increased subjective ratings of “sociable,” “loving,” and “friendly.” Only MDMA increased ratings of “trusting,” “grateful,” and “appreciated,” and only methamphetamine increased ratings of “understood” MDMA (p=0.001), and to a lesser extent methamphetamine (p=0.02) increased salivary oxytocin levels. Notably, oxytocin levels were positively correlated with feelings of closeness after MDMA but not after methamphetamine (Study 1; r=0.52, p=0.03). Conclusions: Both MDMA and methamphetamine increased feelings of closeness and connection to strangers during controlled interpersonal interactions, and both drugs increased subjective ratings of sociability. However, these feelings were related to oxytocin only after MDMA, suggesting that the mechanisms mediating prosocial effects may differ across drugs. This study provides a model for future studies assessing effects of drugs on interpersonal interactions.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"7097","An exploration of actigraphy in the context of ketamine and treatment‐resistant depression.^\nObjectives This study explored the potential of non‐parametric and complexity analysis metrics to detect changes in activity post‐ketamine and their association with depressive symptomatology. Methods Individuals with treatment‐resistant depression (TRD: n = 27, 16F, 35.9 ± 10.8 years) and healthy volunteers (HVs: n = 9, 4F, 36.4 ± 9.59 years) had their activity monitored during an inpatient, double‐blind, crossover study where they received an infusion of ketamine or saline placebo. All participants were 18–65 years old, medication‐free, and had a MADRS score ≥20. Non‐parametric metrics averaged over each study day, metrics derived from complexity analysis, and traditionally calculated non‐parametric metrics averaged over two weeks were calculated from the actigraphy time series. A separate analysis was conducted for a subsample (n = 17) to assess the utility of these metrics in a hospital setting. Results In HVs, lower intradaily variability was observed within daily rest/activity patterns post‐ketamine versus post‐placebo (F = 5.16(1,15), p = 0.04). No other significant effects of drug or drug‐by‐time or correlations between depressive symptomatology and activity were detected.

The aim of this study was to investigate brain activation during response inhibition and performance monitoring in current recreational drug users who predominantly used ecstasy. Twenty drug users (ten female) and twenty healthy controls were scanned during performance of a response-inhibition GO/NOGO task using functional magnetic resonance imaging. No performance deficits were evident. However, the drug user group revealed elevated frontal and parietal BOLD response during successful inhibitions, and temporal, frontal, and cingulate hyperactivity during commission errors. In addition, the users showed reduced deactivation in the default-mode network during task performance.

"8611","Cytokine- and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-Related Gene-Based Genome-Wide Association Study of Low-Dose Ketamine Infusion in Patients with Treatment-Resistant Depression.^\nBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Ketamine may work as an anti-inflammatory agent, and it increases the levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in patients with treatment-resistant depression. However, whether genes related to pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and VEGF may predict the treatment response to ketamine remains unknown.Therefore the aim of this study was to analyze whether specific genes related to inflammatory processes and VEGF were associated with treatment response to low-dose ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant depression. METHODS: Based on the genome data from our clinical trial, this study was a secondary analysis of candidate genes correlated with different timepoints of depressive symptoms. In total, 65 patients with treatment-resistant depression (n = 21 for ketamine 0.5 mg/kg, 20 for ketamine 0.2 mg/kg, and 24 for normal saline) were genotyped for 684,616 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Genes associated with 80 cytokines (i.e., interleukin [IL]-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and adiponectin) and VEGF (i.e., VEGF and VEGF receptors) were selected for the gene-based genome-wide association study on the antidepressant effect of a ketamine infusion. RESULTS: Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms, including rs2540315 and rs75746675 in IL1R1 and rs79568085 in VEGFC, were related to the rapid (within 240 min) antidepressant effect of a ketamine infusion; specific single nucleotide polymorphisms, such as Affx-20131665 in PIGF and rs8179353, rs8179353, and rs8179353 in TNFRSF8, were associated with the sustained (up to 2 weeks) antidepressant effect of low-dose (combined 0.5 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg) ketamine. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings further revealed that genes related to both anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, C-reactive protein, and adiponectin) and VEGF-FLK signaling predicted the treatment response to a ketamine infusion in patients with treatment-resistant depression.

"8706","The effects of low dose ketamine on sensory gating, neuroendocrine secretion and behavior in healthy human subjects.^\nRecently, much interest has been given to the role of glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDA) in sensory gating, such as prepulse inhibition (PPI) and reduction of the P50 evoked response potential (ERP). Currently, mainly animal data are available describing the role of NMDA receptors in these stimulus evaluation processes. Human data are virtually lacking and are potentially important, for instance for the understanding of sensory gating deficits observed in schizophrenia. Therefore, the effects of the NMDA antagonist ketamine, in a dose of 0.3 mg/kg i.v., on concurrent assessment of PPI and P50 reduction was studied in 18 healthy male volunteers. Ketamine was administered in a pseudo-steady state model with a subacute loading dose. In addition, the effects of ketamine on behavior, vital signs, homovanillic acid (HVA) plasma levels and secretion of cortisol and luteinizing hormone (LH) were also determined. Ketamine did not significantly alter PPI or the reduction of the P50 ERP. A small but significant increase in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total scores and BPRS composite scores ""thinking disorder"" and ""withdrawal/retardation"" was observed. Several subjects experienced visual perceptional alterations, but complex hallucinations did not occur. Ketamine induced mild analgesia and coordination problems. In addition, ketamine induced a marked rise in cortisol secretion, while LH secretion was not affected. Finally, systolic and diastolic, blood pressure and heart rate increased during ketamine infusion. Although in humans NMDA receptors may not be involved in the regulation of PPI and P50 reduction, the most likely explanation for the lack of effect of ketamine on these sensory gating paradigms is the dose used in this experiment. However, using a higher dose is hampered by the aspecificity of racemic ketamine. Future studies should use the enantiomer S-ketamine, which is more specific to NMDA receptors, to evaluate the involvement of NMDA receptors in these neurophysiological processes further.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"691","Predicting therapeutic response to oral ketamine for chronic suicidal ideation: a Bayesian network for clinical decision support.^\nBACKGROUND: The glutamatergic modulator ketamine has been shown to result in rapid reductions in both suicidal ideation (SI) and depressive symptoms in clinical trials. There is a practical need for identification of pre-treatment predictors of ketamine response. Previous studies indicate links between treatment response and body mass index (BMI), depression symptoms and previous suicide attempts. Our aim was to explore the use of clinical and demographic factors to predict response to serial doses of oral ketamine for chronic suicidal ideation. METHODS: Thirty-two participants completed the Oral Ketamine Trial on Suicidality (OKTOS). Data for the current study were drawn from pre-treatment and follow-up time-points of OKTOS. Only clinical and sociodemographic variables were included in this analysis. Data were used to create a proof of concept Bayesian network (BN) model of variables predicting prolonged response to oral ketamine, as defined by the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS). RESULTS: The network of potential predictors of response was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. A combination of nine demographic and clinical variables predicted prolonged ketamine response, with strong contributions from BMI, Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), number of suicide attempts, employment status and age. We evaluated and optimised the proposed network to increase the area under the ROC curve (AUC). The performance evaluation demonstrated that the BN predicted prolonged ketamine response with 97% accuracy, and AUC = 0.87. CONCLUSIONS: At present, validated tools to facilitate risk assessment are infrequently used in psychiatric practice. Pre-treatment assessment of individuals' likelihood of response to oral ketamine for chronic suicidal ideation could be beneficial in making more informed decisions about likelihood of success for this treatment course.

"933","Resting-state Network-specific Breakdown of Functional Connectivity during Ketamine Alteration of Consciousness in Volunteers.^\nBACKGROUND: Consciousness-altering anesthetic agents disturb connectivity between brain regions composing the resting-state consciousness networks (RSNs). The default mode network (DMn), executive control network, salience network (SALn), auditory network, sensorimotor network (SMn), and visual network sustain mentation. Ketamine modifies consciousness differently from other agents, producing psychedelic dreaming and no apparent interaction with the environment. The authors used functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore ketamine-induced changes in RSNs connectivity. METHODS: Fourteen healthy volunteers received stepwise intravenous infusions of ketamine up to loss of responsiveness. Because of agitation, data from six subjects were excluded from analysis. RSNs connectivity was compared between absence of ketamine (wake state [W1]), light ketamine sedation, and ketamine-induced unresponsiveness (deep sedation [S2]). RESULTS: Increasing the depth of ketamine sedation from W1 to S2 altered DMn and SALn connectivity and suppressed the anticorrelated activity between DMn and other brain regions. During S2, DMn connectivity, particularly between the medial prefrontal cortex and the remaining network (effect size β [95% CI]: W1 = 0.20 [0.18 to 0.22]; S2 = 0.07 [0.04 to 0.09]), and DMn anticorrelated activity (e.g., right sensory cortex: W1 = -0.07 [-0.09 to -0.04]; S2 = 0.04 [0.01 to 0.06]) were broken down. SALn connectivity was nonuniformly suppressed (e.g., left parietal operculum: W1 = 0.08 [0.06 to 0.09]; S2 = 0.05 [0.02 to 0.07]). Executive control networks, auditory network, SMn, and visual network were minimally affected. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine induces specific changes in connectivity within and between RSNs.

A post hoc pooled analysis of randomized placebo-controlled and open-label trials.^\nBACKGROUND: Whether a second ketamine infusion in the first week improves the antidepressant, antisuicidal, and anti-inflammatory effects of the first low-dose ketamine infusion remains unclear. METHODS: A total of 78 patients with medication-resistant depression were allocated to receive two ketamine infusions (n = 30; days 1 and 4), a single ketamine infusion (n = 24; only day 1), or normal saline placebo infusion (n = 24; only day 1). The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Scale (MADRS) and 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HDRS) were administered before and at 40 min, 240 min, day 2, day 4, day 5, and day 7 after infusion. Serum concentrations of interleukin (IL)-2 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were assessed. RESULTS: Two ketamine infusions improved the overall depressive symptoms (p < 0.001) and melancholic symptoms (p < 0.001) than a single ketamine or placebo infusion. The antisuicidal effect did not differ between the ketamine treatment groups. Two ketamine infusions increased TNF-α levels compared with a single ketamine or placebo infusion (p = 0.015). A single ketamine infusion improved the TNF-α-to-IL-2 ratio, an index of average anti-inflammatory effect, than two ketamine infusions or a single placebo infusion (p = 0.027). DISCUSSION: Repeated low-dose ketamine infusions improved the antidepressant effect, but not the antisuicidal effect, compared with a single infusion. However, repeated ketamine infusions may exert a lesser anti-inflammatory effect than a single infusion.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"2048","Investigating the role of serotonin in visual orientation processing using an 'ecstasy' (MDMA)-based research model.^\nAims/Objectives:A growing body of evidence suggests that regular 'ecstasy' (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) use causes lasting changes to central serotonergic functioning in humans, including in the occipital lobe. Serotonin may play a role in visual orientation processing, mediated in the occipital lobe, via lateral inhibition. The tilt aftereffect is an illusion apparent following adaptation to stimuli angled 5-50° from vertical and thought to be affected by lateral inhibition between occipital neurons. A recent study identified an enhanced tilt aftereffect among ecstasy users, but only in a subset that were recently abstinent from amphetamines. The current study examined the effects of ecstasy use, cannabis use and their interacting effect on the magnitude of the tilt aftereffect among participants with no recent history of amphetamine consumption. Materials and Methods: Eleven ecstasy users, 15 cannabis users, 15 ecstasy plus cannabis users and 15 drug-naïve controls were compared on the magnitude of the tilt aftereffect elicited following adaptation to stimuli angled 15, 30, 40 or 60° from vertical. Results:At a 40° adaptation condition, ecstasy users had a greater magnitude of the tilt aftereffect compared to those that had not taken the drug. Additionally, the extent of ecstasy use was positively associated with the magnitude of the tilt aftereffect generated following 15, 30 and 40° adaptation conditions, but not at 60°. Conclusions:Given that lateral inhibition mediates the tilt aftereffect following adaptation to 5-50°, the findings of a relationship between ecstasy use and tilt magnitude at the 15-40° but not 60° adaptation conditions support a role for serotonin in visual orientation processing via lateral inhibition.

"2106","LSD Acutely Impairs Fear Recognition and Enhances Emotional Empathy and Sociality.^\nLysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is used recreationally and has been evaluated as an adjunct to psychotherapy to treat anxiety in patients with life-threatening illness. LSD is well-known to induce perceptual alterations, but unknown is whether LSD alters emotional processing in ways that can support psychotherapy. We investigated the acute effects of LSD on emotional processing using the Face Emotion Recognition Task (FERT) and Multifaceted Empathy Test (MET). The effects of LSD on social behavior were tested using the Social Value Orientation (SVO) test. Two similar placebo-controlled, double-blind, random-order, crossover studies were conducted using 100 μg LSD in 24 subjects and 200 μg LSD in 16 subjects. All of the subjects were healthy and mostly hallucinogen-naive 25- to 65-year-old volunteers (20 men, 20 women). LSD produced feelings of happiness, trust, closeness to others, enhanced explicit and implicit emotional empathy on the MET, and impaired the recognition of sad and fearful faces on the FERT. LSD enhanced the participants' desire to be with other people and increased their prosocial behavior on the SVO test. These effects of LSD on emotion processing and sociality may be useful for LSD-assisted psychotherapy.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"2227","Acute neuropsychological effects of MDMA and ethanol (co-)administration in healthy volunteers.^\nRATIONALE: In Western societies, a considerable percentage of young people expose themselves to 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ""ecstasy""). Commonly, ecstasy is used in combination with other substances, in particular alcohol (ethanol). MDMA induces both arousing as well as hallucinogenic effects, whereas ethanol is a general central nervous system depressant. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study is to assess the acute effects of single and co-administration of MDMA and ethanol on executive, memory, psychomotor, visuomotor, visuospatial and attention function, as well as on subjective experience. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a four-way, double-blind, randomised, crossover, placebo-controlled study in 16 healthy volunteers (nine male, seven female) between the ages of 18-29. MDMA was given orally (100 mg) and blood alcohol concentration was maintained at 0.6 per thousand by an ethanol infusion regime. RESULTS: Co-administration of MDMA and ethanol was well tolerated and did not show greater impairment of performance compared to the single-drug conditions. Impaired memory function was consistently observed after all drug conditions, whereas impairment of psychomotor function and attention was less consistent across drug conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Co-administration of MDMA and ethanol did not exacerbate the effects of either drug alone. Although the impairment of performance by all drug conditions was relatively moderate, all induced significant impairment of cognitive function.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"

"2673","Effects of low dose ibogaine on subjective mood state and psychological performance.^\nETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Root bark from Tabernanthe iboga has been used traditionally in West Africa as a psychoactive substance in religious rituals. In smaller doses it is reported anecdotally to have stimulant properties. AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the influence of a single 20mg ibogaine dose on psychological variables reflecting subjective mood state and a range of cognitive functions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 21 healthy male volunteers received single 20mg doses of ibogaine after 6 days pretreatment with double-blind paroxetine or placebo. We compared responses to a battery of psychometric tests and subjective mood ratings performed before and 2h after ibogaine dosing, and assessed relationships between changes in test scores and concentrations of active moiety (the sum of molar noribogaine and ibogaine concentrations). Psychological tests were chosen based on responsiveness to opioid and serotonergic ligands. RESULTS: Ibogaine had minimal influence on psychological tests and mood ratings. The ability to selectively ignore distracting spatial information showed some evidence of modulation; however because this effect was limited to the less challenging condition calls into question the reliability of this result. CONCLUSION: We were unable to identify stimulant effects after single 20mg doses of ibogaine. Future research is needed to confirm whether active moiety concentrations impact selective attention abilities while leaving other cognitive functions and mood state unaffected.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"4428","Cognitive performance after repeated administration of the NMDA positive allosteric modulator SAGE-718 in healthy volunteers.^\nBackground: NMDA receptor hypoactivity has been linked to a range of clinical phenomena, including cognitive dysfunction and alterations in social behavior. Potential treatments for conditions characterized by NMDA hypofunction may involve enhancement of NMDA receptor‐related neurotransmission. In a recent suite of target‐engagement studies, SAGE‐718, an investigational positive allosteric modulator of the NMDA receptor, demonstrated effects on electrophysiological and functional imaging biomarkers in healthy volunteers after a low dose ketamine challenge. These findings are consistent with CNS penetrance and functional engagement of the NMDA receptor. Here, the effects of 10‐day repeated exposure of SAGE‐718 on a core cognitive battery were investigated in healthy volunteers. Methods: Forty subjects were randomized (1:1) to either multiple oral doses of SAGE‐718 (n = 19) plus ketamine or placebo (n = 21) plus ketamine, which was delivered in a double‐blinded manner [SAGE‐718: n = 19, mean (SD) age 42.7 (12.00) years, 15.8% female; Placebo: n = 21, mean (SD) age 42.6 (11.56) years, 15.4% female]. SAGE‐718 oral solution or matching placebo solution was administered as a 1.0‐mg dose in a fasted condition once daily (between 7 and 10 AM) over the course of 10 days. Blood samples were taken and processed for pharmacokinetic analysis of concentrations of SAGE‐718. Plasma samples were used to calculate Cmax as well as other PK parameters. Computerized testing was used to measure performance on key cognitive domains, including attention, working memory, processing speed, executive function, and motor reaction time. Assessments included computerized versions of the International Shopping List Test (verbal learning), International Shopping List Test‐Delayed Recall (memory), Groton Maze Learning Test (executive function), Social Emotional Cognition Test (emotional cognition), Detection Test (psychomotor function), Identification Test (attention), One Back Test (working memory), Two Back Test (higher‐order working memory), Stop Signal Reaction Test (inhibition), and the Continuous Paired Associate Learning Test (paired associated learning). A mixed‐effect regression model analysis (MMRM) was applied, with change from baseline in each cognitive test score as the response variable, and treatment, visit, and visit‐by‐treatment interaction as fixed effects, baseline as a covariate, and measurements within the same subject as repeated measure. Unstructured covariance structure was applied for the repeated measure. Safety was assessed by adverse event reporting, standard clinical assessments, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, the Clinician Administered Dissociate State Scale, the Observers Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale, and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Results: As compared to placebo, statistically significant improvements were observed in the Two‐Back Test at days 2, 4 and 8 of testing (p < 0.05). Compared to placebo, statistically significant improvement was observed on the Groton Maze Test at day 6 of testing (p < 0.05). A dose‐response relationship was observed for the Two‐Back Test, with Cmax positively correlated with an increase in change from baseline performance on the Two‐Back Test (p = 0.02). A similar trend was observed for the Groton Maze Test (Cmax vs change from baseline, p = 0.06). SAGE‐718 was generally well tolerated with no serious adverse events or deaths observed in the trial subjects. The most frequent treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported after SAGE‐718 administration were mild and numerically similar to those seen with placebo (TEAE: SAGE‐718, n = 6 (31.6%); placebo, n = 7 (33.3%)). No TEAEs resulted in discontinuation or dose reduction of SAGE‐718. No significant changes in clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, or ECGS were observed. Conclusions: Healthy volunteers dosed with SAGE‐718 exhibited greater improvement on tests of higher‐order working memory (Two‐Back Test) and complex problem solving (Groton Maze Test), which at times reached the threshold for statistical significance as compared to subjects receiving placebo. SAGE‐718 was generally well tolerated by the trial subjects over 10 days of exposure. Improvements in executive performance, as reflected by significant improvements on the Two‐Back and Groton Maze Tests, suggest that further investigation of SAGE‐718 is warranted for the treatment of conditions characterized by states of relative NMDA hypofunction, particularly those manifesting with executive deficits.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"4473","Adverse experiences resulting in emergency medical treatment seeking following the use of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD).^\nBackground: Recreational lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) use is growing in popularity amid increasing research interest on psychedelics and their possible therapeutic potential yet; the potent psychotropic effects of LSD may result in adverse reactions and behaviour. Aims: This study aimed to investigate the 12-month incidence and nature of LSD-related adverse experiences resulting in emergency medical treatment (EMT) seeking in an international sample of people reporting LSD use. Methods: We use data from the 2017 Global Drug Survey – a large anonymous online survey on patterns of drug use conducted between November 2016 and January 2017. Results: Out of 10,293 past-year LSD users, 102 (1.0%) reported seeking EMT, with a per-event risk estimate of 0.2%. Younger age, comorbid mental health conditions and higher frequency of use were associated with increased risk of EMT seeking. The most common symptoms were psychological, including anxiety, panic and confusion, with the most common explanatory factors cited by respondents being poor ‘setting’ and ‘mindset’. Most responders reported feeling back to normal within 24 h, but 11 participants experienced persistent issues after 4 weeks. Conclusion: The results suggest that LSD is a relatively safe drug in recreational settings. Adverse reactions are typically short-lived, self-limiting and psychological in nature. Sub-optimal set and setting were commonly reported as suspected contributory factors. Within clinical settings, patient screening, preparatory sessions and supervision should reduce these acute risks considerably.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"4558","Ketamine psychotherapy for heroin addiction: immediate effects and two-year follow-up.^\nSeventy detoxified heroin-addicted patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups receiving ketamine psychotherapy (KPT) involving two different doses of ketamine. The patients of the experimental group received existentially oriented psychotherapy in combination with a hallucinogenic (""psychedelic"") dose of ketamine (2.0 mg/kg im). The patients of the control group received the same psychotherapy combined with a low, non-hallucinogenic (non-psychedelic), dose of ketamine (0.2 mg/kg im). Both the psychotherapist and patient were blind to the dose of ketamine. The therapy included preparation for the ketamine session, the ketamine session itself, and the post session psychotherapy aimed to help patients to integrate insights from their ketamine session into everyday life. The results of this double blind randomized clinical trial of KPT for heroin addiction showed that high dose (2.0 mg/kg) KPT elicits a full psychedelic experience in heroin addicts as assessed quantitatively by the Hallucinogen Rating Scale. On the other hand, low dose KPT (0.2 mg/kg) elicits ""sub-psychedelic"" experiences and functions as ketamine-facilitated guided imagery. High dose KPT produced a significantly greater rate of abstinence in heroin addicts within the first two years of follow-up, a greater and longer-lasting reduction in craving for heroin, as well as greater positive change in nonverbal unconscious emotional attitudes than did low dose KPT.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"

This study tested whether the addition of ketamine reduced cognitive impairment and enhanced efficacy over a course of ECT, in a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. METHODS: Fifty-one depressed patients treated with ultrabrief pulse-width right unilateral ECT were randomised to receive either ketamine (0.5mg/kg) or placebo (saline) in addition to thiopentone during anaesthesia for ECT. Neuropsychological outcomes (measured before ECT, after six treatments, and after the final ECT treatment) and mood outcomes (measured before ECT, and weekly after every three ECT treatments) were measured by a rater blinded to treatment condition. RESULTS: Neuropsychological outcomes did not differ between groups. The ECT-ketamine group had a slightly greater improvement in depressive symptoms over the first week of treatment and at one-week follow up, though there was no overall difference in efficacy at the end of the ECT course. No psychomimetic effects were detected. LIMITATIONS: The study was conducted in a clinical setting, so not all aspects of ECT treatment were fully controlled. Thiopentone doses differed slightly between groups, in order to accommodate the addition of ketamine to the anaesthetic. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of ketamine did not decrease cognitive impairment in patients having ultrabrief pulse-width right unilateral ECT, but was safe and slightly improved efficacy in the first week of treatment and at one-week follow up.

The interest in psychedelic-assisted therapies as a potential new therapeutic modality has increased since evidence suggests a significant impact of their use on the outcomes of patients with serious illness. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the available evidence on the effects of psychedelic-assisted therapies for symptom control in patients diagnosed with serious illness. METHODS: The protocol of this systematic review has been prepared according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols guidelines. This review included randomized and non-randomized controlled trials published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. A comprehensive search for studies was carried out in the main scientific databases, including Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, PubMed, CINAHL, and EMBASE. There were no limitations regarding the year or language of publication. RESULTS: The sample was composed of 20 studies. The results suggest positive effects of psychedelic-assisted therapies for symptom control in patients diagnosed with serious illness, with considerable safety of use. Most studies have been conducted with lysergic acid diethylamide, psilocybin, and N,N-dipropyltryptamine in cancer patients. The adverse effects reported were of physical and/or psychological nature and of mild to moderate intensity, transient, and self-resolutive.

"5901","Ayahuasca’s ‘afterglow’: improved mindfulness and cognitive flexibility in ayahuasca drinkers.^\nRationale: There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating the therapeutic potential of ayahuasca for treating depression and anxiety. However, the mechanisms of action involved in ayahuasca’s therapeutic effects are unclear. Mindfulness and cognitive flexibility may be two possible psychological mechanisms. Like other classic psychedelics, ayahuasca also leads to an ‘afterglow’ effect of improved subjective well-being that persists after the acute effects have subsided. This period may offer a window of increased therapeutic potential. Objective: To explore changes in mindfulness and cognitive flexibility before and within 24 h after ayahuasca use. Methods: Forty-eight participants (54% female) were assessed on measures of mindfulness (Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ)), decentering (Experiences Questionnaire (EQ)), and cognitive flexibility (Cognitive Flexibility Scale (CFS)), and completed the Stroop and Wisconsin Picture Card Sorting Task (WPCST) before drinking ayahuasca, and again within 24 h. Results: Mindfulness (FFMQ total scores and four of the five mindfulness facets: observe, describe, act with awareness, and non-reactivity) and decentering (EQ) significantly increased in the 24 h after ayahuasca use. Cognitive flexibility (CFS and WPCST) significantly improved in the 24 h after ayahuasca use. Changes in both mindfulness and cognitive flexibility were not influenced by prior ayahuasca use. Conclusions: The present study supports ayahuasca’s ability to enhance mindfulness and further reports changes in cognitive flexibility in the ‘afterglow’ period occur, suggesting both could be possible psychological mechanisms concerning the psychotherapeutic effects of ayahuasca. Given psychological gains occurred regardless of prior ayahuasca use suggests potentially therapeutic effects for both naïve and experienced ayahuasca drinkers.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"7268","Effects of dose, sex, and long-term abstention from use on toxic effects of MDMA (ecstasy) on brain serotonin neurons.^\nBackground: 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy) is a popular recreational drug that has been shown to damage brain serotonin neurons in high doses. However, effects of moderate MDMA use on serotonin neurons have not been studied, and sex differences and the long-term effects of MDMA use on serotonin neurons have not been identified. We investigated the effects of moderate and heavy MDMA use, sex differences, and long-term effects of MDMA use on serotonin neurons in different brain regions. Methods: By means of flyers posted in ""rave"" venues in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, we recruited 15 moderate MDMA users, 23 heavy MDMA users, 16 ex-MDMA users who had stopped using MDMA for more than 1 year, and 15 controls who claimed never to have used MDMA. We studied the effects of MDMA on brain serotonin neurons using 123iodine-2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl) tropane ([123I]β-CIT) - a radioligand that binds with high affinity to serotonin transporters. Density of binding (expressed as a ratio of region-of-interest binding over binding in the cerebellum) was calculated by single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT). Findings:CT). Findings: We saw significant effects of group and group by sex (p=0.041 and p=0.022, respectively) on overall [123I]β-CIT binding ratios. In heavy MDMA users, significant decreases in overall binding ratios were seen in women (p<0.01) but not men (p=0.587). In female ex-MDMA users, overall densities of serotonin transporters were significantly higher than in heavy MDMA users (p=0.004), but not higher than in controls (p=0.524). Interpretation: Our results indicate that heavy use of MDMA is associated with neurotoxic effects on serotonin neurons, that women might be more susceptible than men, and that MDMA-induced neurotoxic changes in several brain regions of female ex-MDMA users are reversible.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"7484","Rapid and sustained symptom reduction following psilocybin treatment for anxiety and depression in patients with life-threatening cancer: a randomized controlled trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Clinically significant anxiety and depression are common in patients with cancer, and are associated with poor psychiatric and medical outcomes. Historical and recent research suggests a role for psilocybin to treat cancer-related anxiety and depression. METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, 29 patients with cancer-related anxiety and depression were randomly assigned and received treatment with single-dose psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg) or niacin, both in conjunction with psychotherapy. The primary outcomes were anxiety and depression assessed between groups prior to the crossover at 7 weeks. RESULTS: Prior to the crossover, psilocybin produced immediate, substantial, and sustained improvements in anxiety and depression and led to decreases in cancer-related demoralization and hopelessness, improved spiritual wellbeing, and increased quality of life. At the 6.5-month follow-up, psilocybin was associated with enduring anxiolytic and anti-depressant effects (approximately 60-80% of participants continued with clinically significant reductions in depression or anxiety), sustained benefits in existential distress and quality of life, as well as improved attitudes towards death. The psilocybin-induced mystical experience mediated the therapeutic effect of psilocybin on anxiety and depression. CONCLUSIONS: In conjunction with psychotherapy, single moderate-dose psilocybin produced rapid, robust and enduring anxiolytic and anti-depressant effects in patients with cancer-related psychological distress.

METHODS: In 2019, the French Health Authorities exceptionally granted the first ATUc in psychiatry for TRD patients. Clinical characteristics, safety and efficacy data were reported by physicians. The ATUc ended ∼6 months after initiation. RESULTS: The cohort (n = 66; median age 53.0 years; 62.1% female; 78.8% with severe major depressive episodes; resistance to a mean of 4.2 previous antidepressants) received esketamine treatment for a median of 30 days. Among 46 analysed patients, 22 (47.8%) achieved response (Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] total score reduction ≥50.0%) and 17 (37.0%) achieved remission (MADRS total score of ≤12) at least once at a median of 18.5 (2.0-77.0) and 21.0 (2.0-46.0) days after initiation, respectively. By Week 4, patients had a 31.6% probability of achieving remission (Kaplan-Meier method). Sedation, somnolence, dizziness, hypertension, anxiety and dissociation were the most frequently reported (>10.0%) adverse events. No new safety signals were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Patient characteristics of this cohort demonstrate high-level treatment resistance. The safety and efficacy of esketamine in patients with TRD in real-world clinical practice were consistent with Phase 3 trials.Key pointsPatients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) exceptionally received esketamine nasal spray ahead of its launch through a French cohort Temporary Authorisation for Use (ATUc) programme.The clinical characteristics of 66 adult patients with TRD included in this cohort demonstrated a high-level of resistance to conventional treatments at the time of treatment request prior to esketamine initiation.No new safety signals were observed with esketamine initiation during the ATUc period compared with the Phase 3 clinical trials.The safety and efficacy of esketamine in the real world remain consistent with that established in Phase 3 clinical trials.The data collected during this ATUc also provide the first real-world data on the management and practical use of esketamine in a hospital setting in France.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"8634","Treatment Response With Esketamine Nasal Spray Plus an Oral Antidepressant in Patients With Treatment-Resistant Depression Without Evidence of Early Response: A Pooled Post Hoc Analysis of the TRANSFORM Studies.^\nObjective: To evaluate response to esketamine nasal spray plus an oral antidepressant (ESK + AD) at day 28 in patients with major depressive disorder (DSM-5) and treatment-resistant depression (TRD) who did not meet response criteria within the first week of treatment. Methods: The current study is a pooled post hoc analysis of two phase 3, double-blind, active-controlled studies, conducted between August 2015 and February 2018, comparing ESK + AD with an oral antidepressant plus placebo (AD + PBO). Early treatment response was defined as a ≥ 50% decrease in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score at day 2 or days 2 and 8. Response rates at day 28 were determined among those not meeting early response criteria. Results: 518 patients in the analysis had day 28 observations (ESK + AD, n = 310; AD + PBO, n = 208). A greater percentage of patients treated with ESK + AD versus AD + PBO met response criteria beginning at day 2 (17.3% [55/318] vs 9.4% [19/203]) and at all subsequent timepoints, including day 28 (58.7% [182/310] vs 45.2% [94/208]). In day 2 nonresponders, 54.9% vs 44.3% (ESK + AD vs AD + PBO, respectively) achieved response at day 28 (P < .01). Similarly, among day 2 and 8 nonresponders, 52.1% vs 42.4% achieved response by day 28 (P = .01). In nonresponders at day 2 and at days 2 and 8, the odds ratio for a response at day 28 was 1.61 (95% CI, 1.09-2.40) with ESK + AD versus 1.56 (95% CI, 1.04-2.35) with AD + PBO. Conclusions: Patients with TRD without a demonstrated response within the first week of treatment may still derive benefit from a full 4-week induction course of esketamine nasal spray.

"9452","A randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 1 study to evaluate the effects of TAK-063 on ketamine-induced changes in fMRI BOLD signal in healthy subjects.^\nRationale: Phosphodiesterase 10A inhibitor TAK-063 has shown effects that suggest efficacy in schizophrenia treatment. Objective: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, incomplete-crossover study investigated effects of single oral administration of TAK-063 on ketamine-induced changes in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal in healthy males. Methods: Healthy men aged 18 to 45 years with normal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and electroencephalogram measurements at screening were eligible. Each subject was randomized to one of nine treatment schedules: all subjects received placebo and two of three doses of TAK-063 followed by ketamine. The primary endpoint was ketamine-induced brain activity in select regions of the brain during resting state. Secondary endpoints included pharmacokinetic parameters of TAK-063, proportion of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), and percentage of subjects meeting criteria for abnormal safety laboratory tests and vital sign measurements. Results: The study comprised 27 subjects. Prior to ketamine infusion, TAK-063 exerted region-specific effects on resting state functional MRI (fMRI) BOLD signal. After ketamine administration, TAK-063 reduced the Cohen’s effect size for resting-state fMRI BOLD signal in key brain regions examined, and exerted similar effects on BOLD signal during the working memory task across all doses. TAK-063 was safe and well tolerated. Conclusions: Our results are consistent with non-clinical studies of ketamine and TAK-063 and clinical studies of ketamine and risperidone. It is unknown whether these data are predictive of potential antipsychotic efficacy, and further analyses are required.

"9484","Replication of ketamine's antidepressant efficacy in bipolar depression: a randomized controlled add-on trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Currently, no pharmacological treatments for bipolar depression exist that exert rapid (within hours) antidepressant or antisuicidal effects. We previously reported that intravenous administration of the N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist ketamine produced rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant bipolar depression. The present study sought to replicate this finding in an independent sample. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled study, 15 subjects with DSM-IV bipolar I or II depression maintained on therapeutic levels of lithium or valproate received a single intravenous infusion of either ketamine hydrochloride (.5 mg/kg) or placebo on 2 test days 2 weeks apart. The primary outcome measure was the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, which was used to rate overall depressive symptoms at baseline; at 40, 80, 110, and 230 minutes postinfusion; and on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 10, and 14 postinfusion. RESULTS: Within 40 minutes, depressive symptoms, as well as suicidal ideation, significantly improved in subjects receiving ketamine compared with placebo (d = .89, 95% confidence interval = .61-1.16, and .98, 95% confidence interval = .64-1.33, respectively); this improvement remained significant through day 3. Seventy-nine percent of subjects responded to ketamine and 0% responded to placebo at some point during the trial. The most common side effect was dissociative symptoms, which occurred only at the 40-minute time point. CONCLUSIONS: This study replicated our previous finding that patients with bipolar depression who received a single ketamine infusion experienced a rapid and robust antidepressant response. In addition, we found that ketamine rapidly improved suicidal ideation in these patients.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

The multi‐arm adaptive design will compare three different psilocybin regimens to a control. All participants will engage in identical study procedures and therapy sessions, only the drug used within the groups will be varied. Within the 4 arms: Arm A is the control arm with Dexamfetamine administered in all three treatment sessions. Arm B and C include combined therapies of either Dexamfetamine or Psilocybin across the three treatment sessions. Arm D is the active arm with Psilocybin administered in all three treatment sessions. only. Each medication session will involve either a single dose of 25mg of psilocybin or 7.5mg of dexamfetamine (depending on treatment arm) via an oral tablet, up to 3 times, 2‐4 weeks apart. At the start of the study, participants will be randomly assigned by chance through a computer‐generated sequence to one of four groups (arms) and neither the participant nor any member of the treating team will know what group the participant has been allocated to, or what medication will be given during the sessions. The first 50 participants will be equally randomised to the initial 4 treatment arms in a 1:1:1:1 ratio.

"518","Intimate insight: MDMA changes how people talk about significant others.^\nRATIONALE: ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is widely believed to increase sociability. The drug alters speech production and fluency, and may influence speech content. Here, we investigated the effect of MDMA on speech content, which may reveal how this drug affects social interactions. METHOD: Thirty-five healthy volunteers with prior MDMA experience completed this two-session, within-subjects, double-blind study during which they received 1.5 mg/kg oral MDMA and placebo. Participants completed a five-minute standardized talking task during which they discussed a close personal relationship (e.g. a friend or family member) with a research assistant. The conversations were analyzed for selected content categories (e.g. words pertaining to affect, social interaction, and cognition), using both a standard dictionary method (Pennebaker's Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count: LIWC) and a machine learning method using random forest classifiers. RESULTS: Both analytic methods revealed that MDMA altered speech content relative to placebo. Using LIWC scores, the drug increased use of social and sexual words, consistent with reports that MDMA increases willingness to disclose. Using the machine learning algorithm, we found that MDMA increased use of social words and words relating to both positive and negative emotions. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with reports that MDMA acutely alters speech content, specifically increasing emotional and social content during a brief semistructured dyadic interaction. Studying effects of psychoactive drugs on speech content may offer new insights into drug effects on mental states, and on emotional and psychosocial interaction.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"640","Validation of the revised Mystical Experience Questionnaire in experimental sessions with psilocybin.^\nThe 30-item revised Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ30) was previously developed within an online survey of mystical-type experiences occasioned by psilocybin-containing mushrooms. The rated experiences occurred on average eight years before completion of the questionnaire. The current paper validates the MEQ30 using data from experimental studies with controlled doses of psilocybin. Data were pooled and analyzed from five laboratory experiments in which participants (n=184) received a moderate to high oral dose of psilocybin (at least 20 mg/70 kg). Results of confirmatory factor analysis demonstrate the reliability and internal validity of the MEQ30. Structural equation models demonstrate the external and convergent validity of the MEQ30 by showing that latent variable scores on the MEQ30 positively predict persisting change in attitudes, behavior, and well-being attributed to experiences with psilocybin while controlling for the contribution of the participant-rated intensity of drug effects. These findings support the use of the MEQ30 as an efficient measure of individual mystical experiences. A method to score a ""complete mystical experience"" that was used in previous versions of the mystical experience questionnaire is validated in the MEQ30, and a stand-alone version of the MEQ30 is provided for use in future research.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"718","Metamemory in recreational ecstasy polydrug users: What do self-reports of memory failures mean?.^\nPrevious research has found relationships between self-rated memory and ecstasy use, such that heavier users report worse function. These findings have been interpreted in terms of objective memory capacity. However, research on metamemory suggests that self-reported memory may be only weakly related to objective function, with demographics, mood, and memory-related beliefs and feelings also contributing to ratings. This study examined relationships between ecstasy/other drug use and self-reported memory, controlling for effects of demographic factors and mood. Associations between self-reported memory, memory-related beliefs and feelings, and objectively-measured cognitive function were also examined. Forty-five ecstasy polydrug, 48 cannabis polydrug, and 40 legal drug users completed a battery of neuropsychological tests and questionnaire measures of metamemory, including memory-related control beliefs, memory-related anxiety, and self-reported prospective and general/retrospective memory. The combined polydrug groups reported more general/retrospective memory failures. Covariance analysis, however, suggested that this finding was confounded by general anxiety levels. A combination of objective cognitive measures contributed to prediction of self-rated prospective memory, with demographics, mood, and memory-related anxiety also contributing to variability. However, associations between objective and self-reported memory were not strong. Self-report may not be a specific methodology with which to assess objective memory capacities in ecstasy and other drug users. © 2008 British Association for Psychopharmacology.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

Design: We have completed the Phase I component, a double‐blind, singleascending dose study, assessing safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of four intravenous (IV) doses of SPL026 with therapy in psychedelic‐naive healthy volunteers (6 active and 2 placebo per cohort). Results: SPL026 was safe and well tolerated, with no serious adverse events and few drug‐related adverse events across all dose cohorts. Detailed PK profiles for DMT were elucidated, and a model was developed to understand and predict the PK profiles of various doses of SPL026. DMT is rapidly metabolized, with a half‐life of about 11 minutes, which underpins the observed short psychedelic experiences of up to 30 minutes. Following PK/PD analysis, a strong exposureresponse relationship for both the intensity and quality of the psychedelic experience was demonstrated. In addition, no correlation between exposure versus age, weight, or body mass index (BMI) of subjects was shown. Conclusion: We have developed a safe and well‐tolerated IV infusion protocol and accompanying psychotherapy model for administration of SPL026 to elicit, in a dose‐predictive way, a significant psychedelic experience with the potential to provide therapeutic efficacy in a number of mental health disorders. Psychedelics, such as DMT, offer the potential of an alternative treatment paradigm to the traditional selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or psychotherapy models currently available to patients.

"1097","Can the severity of dependence scale be usefully applied to 'ecstasy'?.^\nBackground/Aims: Although use of 'ecstasy' (drugs sold as containing 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) is prevalent, it is typically infrequent, and treatment presentations involving ecstasy as a principal problem drug are relatively rare. Human case reports and animal literature suggest dependence potential, although there may be some unique aspects to this syndrome for ecstasy in comparison to other substances. The Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS) was examined to determine whether this could usefully identify 'dependent' ecstasy consumers. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 1,658 frequent (at least monthly) ecstasy consumers across Australia, assessing drug use, associated harms and risk behaviours. Dependence was evaluated with the SDS, using a cut-off of ≥4 to identify potential 'dependence'. Results: One fifth of the participants were screened as potentially dependent. These individuals used ecstasy more frequently, in greater amounts, engaged more extensively in risk behaviours and reported greater role interference than other participants. These findings were independent of methamphetamine use or dependence. The underlying structure of the ecstasy SDS was bifactorial. Conclusions: The SDS has demonstrated construct validity as a screening tool to identify ecstasy users at elevated risk of experiencing adverse consequences, including features of dependence. The underlying structure of dependence symptoms differs for ecstasy compared to other drug classes, and some dependent consumers use the drug infrequently. The unique neurotoxic potential and entactogenic effects of ecstasy may require a distinct nosological classification for the experience of dependence associated with the drug. Copyright © 2009 S.

However, experimental studies have shown MDMA to be neurotoxic. Data on pharmacologic actions of MDMA in humans are limited. The authors conducted a randomized, double-blind, crossover, controlled trial to assess psychomotor performance and subjective effects in eight healthy male volunteers. MDMA was given in the same range of doses used for recreational purposes (75 and 125 mg). Amphetamine (40 mg) and placebo were used as reference compounds. For the digit-symbol substitution test (DSST), MDMA-125 produced a mild decrease in responses, and amphetamine produced a mild improvement. For the Maddox wing device, MDMA-125 induced esophoria compared with the other drug conditions. MDMA-125 and MDMA-75 produced increases in feelings of euphoria and well-being, as noted by increases in scores on the Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI) MBG and A scales, as well as scores of ""stimulated,"" ""good effects,"" ""liking,"" and ""high"" on the visual analog scales. Amphetamine administration induced similar effects. At the same time, MDMA-125 enhanced sedation- and dysphoria-related effects (ARCI-PCAG and LSD, ""confusion,"" ""drunken,"" and Profile of Mood States Confusion scale). Mild changes in some body perception-related feelings were also reported after MDMA use, but hallucinations or psychoses were not present. In summary, the short-term administration of MDMA produced marked euphoria, a slight impairment in the performance of psychomotor tasks, and mild changes in body perceptions without hallucinations.

"1237","A novel study design to evaluate the rapid reduction of the symptoms of major depressive disorder, including suicidal ideation, in subjects assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide.^\nBackground: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with an elevated rate of mortality, primarily due to suicide. The risk of suicide in those with MDD is about 20 times that of the general population, with approximately half of all suicides occurring in depressed individuals. While conventional antidepressants are often effective in treating depressive symptoms including suicidal ideation (SI), their delayed onset of action significantly limits their utility in the treatment of patients with MDD who are at imminent risk of for suicide. Recently, several studies of ketamine and esketamine have demonstrated that these agents can improve symptoms of depression in individuals with MDD within hours of administration. Additionally, preliminary studies of ketamine suggest it may have a similarly rapid effect in significantly reducing SI in subjects with MDD. As such, Janssen R&D is developing intranasal esketamine for the rapid reduction of the symptoms of MDD, including SI, in patients who are assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide. The pursuit of this novel indication has required the development of an innovative study design that allows for the detection of rapid symptom change, and addresses the safety and ethical concerns of studying an acutely suicidal patient population. This poster will discuss the design and implementation of PeRSEVERe (ESKETINSUI2001), an ongoing proof‐of‐concept study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intranasal esketamine in subjects with MDD who are assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide. Methods: PeRSEVERe is an ongoing 12‐week, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, multicenter Phase 2 study of intranasal esketamine in 70 adult subjects with MDD who are assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide. Eligible subjects must have active suicidal ideation and intent, and be in need of psychiatric hospitalization. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of intranasal esketamine 84 mg compared with intranasal placebo in reducing the symptoms of MDD, including SI, in subjects who are assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide, as measured by the change from baseline on the MADRS total score at 4 hours post‐dose on Day 1. Secondary efficacy objectives include the assessment of single and repeated doses of intranasal esketamine compared with intranasal placebo on the clinician's assessment of suicide risk as measured by the Clinical Global Judgment of Suicide Risk from the Suicide Ideation and Behavior Assessment Tool, and the subject's report of the severity in suicidal ideation as measured by the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation, through the end of the double‐blind treatment and follow‐up phases. Additionally, the study evaluates response rates (≥ 50% reduction in MADRS total score from baseline, with onset by Day 1 sustained through the end of the double‐blind treatment phase) across treatment groups. Safety objectives include the assessment of dissociative and psychosis‐like symptoms, sedation, nasal tolerability, vital signs and suicidal thinking and behavior. The study consists of a 24‐48 hour screening evaluation performed prior to the Day 1 intranasal dose, immediately followed by a 25‐day double blind treatment phase, and a 56‐day follow up phase. Given the vulnerability of the patient population, the study is being conducted in the context of standard clinical care, with all subjects receiving standard antidepressant medication and initial in‐patient hospitalization. Results: PeRSEVERe is the first large‐scale, prospective, placebo‐controlled trial of a rapidly acting antidepressant in subjects with MDD who are assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide. The study is being conducted in the United States and is currently ongoing, with over 70% of subjects enrolled. Details and rationale for the study design, outcome measures, and key efficacy times points will be discussed. Additionally, key operational insights and challenges unique to the study of a rapidly acting antidepressant in a suicidal patient population will e highlighted. Conclusions: PeRSERVERe employs innovative clinical trial methodology in a Phase 2 study for a novel indication, in a vulnerable patient population‐i.e. the rapid reduction of symptoms of MDD, including SI, in subjects assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide. Should this approach prove successful in Phase 2, similar methods will be considered in the design of subsequent pivotal trials of esketamine, and possibly other rapidly acting antidepressants. Results of PeRSERVERe are expected to be available in 2016.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"1649","Comparative study of esketamine and racemic ketamine in treatment-resistant depression: Protocol for a non-inferiority clinical trial.^\nINTRODUCTION: The use of ketamine as an option in the treatment of depressive disorder is growing rapidly, supported by numerous clinical trials attesting its efficacy and safety. Esketamine, the S (+) enantiomer of ketamine, is the most widely used form in the anesthetic environment in some countries, and new studies have shown that it may also be effective in depression and with better tolerability. However, no study so far has directly compared esketamine with racemic ketamine. Here we propose a protocol of a clinical trial to evaluate esketamine as a noninferior medication when compared to ketamine in the treatment of patients with treatment-resistant depression. METHODS/DESIGN: This study protocol is for a randomized, controlled, double-blind noninferiority clinical trial. Subjects will be 18 years or older, with major depression characterized as treatment-resistant. Participants will receive a single infusion of either esketamine (0.25 mg/kg) or ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) over 40 minutes. The primary outcome will be the difference in remission rates between the 2 treatment arms at 24 and 72 hours after drug infusion. Secondary outcomes will include other timepoints, measurements of cognition, dissociation, and blood biomarkers. DISCUSSION: A head-to-head study is the best way to evaluate whether the esketamine is in fact comparable to the racemic ketamine in terms of both efficacy and safety, and, if positive, it would be an initial step to increase the access to that type of treatment worldwide. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the local Institutional Review Board (University Hospital Professor Edgard Santos-Federal University of Bahia-Number: 46657415.0.0000.0049). Subjects will only participate after voluntarily agreeing and signing the Informed Consent Form. The study findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national and international conferences.

Psychotic symptoms, perceptual, and a number of subjective effects were assessed repeatedly before, several times during, and after completion of ketamine administration. A cognitive battery was administered once per test day. Ketamine produced behavioral, subjective, and cognitive effects consistent with its known effects. Org 25935 reduced the ketamine-induced increases in measures of psychosis (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)) and perceptual alterations (Clinician Administered Dissociative Symptoms Scale (CADSS)). The magnitude of the effect of Org 25935 on ketamine-induced increases in Total PANSS and CADSS Clinician-rated scores was 0.71 and 0.98 (SD units), respectively. None of the behavioral effects of ketamine were increased by Org 25935 pretreatment. Org 25935 worsened some aspects of learning and delayed recall, and trended to improve choice reaction time. This study demonstrates for the first time in humans that a GlyT1 inhibitor reduces the effects induced by NMDA receptor antagonism. These findings provide preliminary support for further study of the antipsychotic potential of GlyT1 inhibitors.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"1799","Neurocognitive effects of repeated ketamine infusion treatments in patients with treatment resistant depression: a retrospective chart review.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine has emerged as a rapid-acting antidepressant in treatment-resistant depression (TRD) increasingly used in non-research, clinical settings. Few studies, however, have examined neurocognitive effects of repeated racemic ketamine infusion treatments in patients with TRD. In an effort to identify potential effects after serial infusions, we conducted a retrospective chart review to identify statistically significant changes in cognition in patient undergoing serial intravenous infusions; concomitantly, we examined baseline cognition as potential predictor of anti-depressant potential. METHODS: Twenty-two patients with TRD were examined after they finished the induction phase of 8-10 repeated intravenous ketamine infusions and completed the assessments of their depressive symptoms (measured by the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report Scale: QIDS-SR16) and cognitive function (measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment: MoCA) before the first and the last ketamine treatments. RESULTS: Repeated ketamine infusions administered through an escalating dose protocol with 8-10 infusion sessions produced a 47.2% reduction response in depression; there was no evidence of impairment as reflected in MoCA testing. There was a moderate association between baseline cognition and antidepressant response with a Pearson correlation of 0.453. CONCLUSION: In this naturalistic sample of patients with TRD in our clinical service, repeated ketamine infusions significantly decreased depression symptoms without impairing cognitive performance. The baseline cognition may positively predict antidepressant responses of repeated ketamine treatment.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"1886","Modulation of Serum Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor by a Single Dose of Ayahuasca: Observation From a Randomized Controlled Trial.^\nSerotonergic psychedelics are emerging as potential antidepressant therapeutic tools, as suggested in a recent randomized controlled trial with ayahuasca for treatment-resistant depression. Preclinical and clinical studies have suggested that serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels increase after treatment with serotoninergic antidepressants, but the exact role of BDNF as a biomarker for diagnostic and treatment of major depression is still poorly understood. Here we investigated serum BDNF levels in healthy controls (N = 45) and patients with treatment-resistant depression (N = 28) before (baseline) and 48 h after (D2) a single dose of ayahuasca or placebo. In our sample, baseline serum BDNF levels did not predict major depression and the clinical characteristics of the patients did not predict their BDNF levels. However, at baseline, serum cortisol was a predictor of serum BDNF levels, where lower levels of serum BDNF were detected in a subgroup of subjects with hypocortisolemia. Moreover, at baseline we found a negative correlation between BDNF and serum cortisol in volunteers with eucortisolemia. After treatment (D2) we observed higher BDNF levels in both patients and controls that ingested ayahuasca (N = 35) when compared to placebo (N = 34). Furthermore, at D2 just patients treated with ayahuasca (N = 14), and not with placebo (N = 14), presented a significant negative correlation between serum BDNF levels and depressive symptoms. This is the first double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial that explored the modulation of BDNF in response to a psychedelic in patients with depression. The results suggest a potential link between the observed antidepressant effects of ayahuasca and changes in serum BDNF, which contributes to the emerging view of using psychedelics as an antidepressant. This trial is registered at http://clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02914769).","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"1963","Ketamine and other glutamate receptor modulators for depression in adults with unipolar major depressive disorder.^\nBACKGROUND: Many studies have recently been conducted to assess the antidepressant efficacy of glutamate modification in mood disorders. This is an update of a review first published in 2015 focusing on the use of glutamate receptor modulators in unipolar depression. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects - and review the acceptability and tolerability - of ketamine and other glutamate receptor modulators in alleviating the acute symptoms of depression in people with unipolar major depressive disorder. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO all years to July 2020.  We did not apply any restrictions to date, language or publication status. SELECTION CRITERIA: Double- or single-blinded randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ketamine, memantine, esketamine or other glutamate receptor modulators with placebo (pill or saline infusion), other active psychotropic drugs, or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in adults with unipolar major depression. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three review authors independently identified studies, assessed trial quality and extracted data. The primary outcomes were response rate (50% reduction on a standardised rating scale) and adverse events. We decided a priori to measure the efficacy outcomes at different time points and run sensitivity/subgroup analyses. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool, and certainty of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-one new studies were identified for inclusion in this updated review. Overall, we included 64 studies (5299 participants) on ketamine (31 trials), esketamine (9), memantine (5), lanicemine (4), D-cycloserine (2), Org26576 (2), riluzole (2), atomoxetine (1), basimglurant (1), citicoline (1), CP-101,606 (1), decoglurant (1), MK-0657 (1), N-acetylcysteine (1), rapastinel (1), and sarcosine (1). Forty-eight studies were placebo-controlled, and 48 were two-arm studies. The majority of trials defined an inclusion criterion for the severity of depressive symptoms at baseline: 29 at least moderate depression; 17 severe depression; and five mild-to-moderate depression. Nineteen studies recruited only patients with treatment-resistant depression, defined as inadequate response to at least two antidepressants. The majority of studies investigating ketamine administered as a single dose, whilst all of the included esketamine studies used a multiple dose regimen (most frequently twice a week for four weeks). Most studies looking at ketamine used intravenous administration, whilst the majority of esketamine trials used intranasal routes. The evidence suggests that ketamine may result in an increase in response and remission compared with placebo at 24 hours odds ratio (OR) 3.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.54 to 10.10; n = 185, studies = 7, very low-certainty evidence). Ketamine may reduce depression rating scale scores over placebo at 24 hours, but the evidence is very uncertain (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.87, 95% CI -1.26 to -0.48; n = 231, studies = 8, very low-certainty evidence). There was no difference in the number of participants assigned to ketamine or placebo who dropped out for any reason (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.19 to 8.28; n = 201, studies = 6, very low-certainty evidence). When compared with midazolam, the evidence showed that ketamine increases remission rates at 24 hours (OR 2.21, 95% CI 0.67 to 7.32; n = 122,studies = 2, low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the response efficacy of ketamine at 24 hours in comparison with midazolam, and its ability to reduce depression rating scale scores at the same time point (OR 2.48, 95% CI 1.00 to 6.18; n = 296, studies = 4,very low-certainty evidence). There was no difference in the number of participants who dropped out of studies for any reason between ketamine and placebo (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.05 to 2.09; n = 72, studies = 1, low-certainty evidence). Esketamine treatment likely results in a large increase in participants achieving remission at 24 hours compared with placebo (OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.71 to 4.40; n = 894, studies = 5, moderate-certainty evidence). Esketamine probably results in decreases in depression rating scale scores at 24 hours compared with placebo (SMD -0.31, 95% CI -0.45 to -0.17; n = 824, studies = 4, moderate-certainty evidence). Our findings show that esketamine increased response rates, although this evidence is uncertain (OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.20 to 3.68; n = 1071, studies = 5, low-certainty evidence). There was no evidence that participants assigned to esketamine treatment dropped out of trials more frequently than those assigned to placebo for any reason (OR 1.58, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.73; n = 773, studies = 4,moderate-certainty evidence). We found very little evidence for the remaining glutamate receptor modulators. We rated the risk of bias as low or unclear for most domains, though lack of detail regarding masking of treatment in the studies reduced our certainty in the effect for all outcomes. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that ketamine and esketamine may be more efficacious than placebo at 24 hours. How these findings translate into clinical practice, however, is not entirely clear. The evidence for use of the remaining glutamate receptor modulators is limited as very few trials were included in the meta-analyses for each comparison and the majority of comparisons included only one study. Long term non-inferiority RCTs comparing repeated ketamine and esketamine, and rigorous real-world monitoring are needed to establish comprehensive data on safety and efficacy.","[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"2105","Acute dose-response effects of LSD in healthy humans.^\nBackground: LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) is a classic hallucinogen. It was widely studied in the 1950s to 1970s as an adjunct to psychotherapy (psycholytic therapy) and as a model to study psychotic states. Today, LSD is again in the focus of several investigations ranging from pharmacological research studies in healthy subjects [1‐3] to studies investigating LSD as a possible treatment for anxiety associated with terminal illness [4]. Because of the continued popularity of LSD as recreational drug and renewed interest in its therapeutic use we examined the acute response to two different doses of LSD in healthy subjects under controlled conditions. Methods: Data from two double‐blind, placebo controlled experimental studies were used to establish dose‐response relationships. Study 1 investigated the effects of 100mg LSD vs. Placebo and study 2 investigated the effects of 200mg LSD vs. Placebo. Both studies were performed in a cross‐over design. Twenty‐four subjects (12 men, 12 women; mean age 33±11 years) participated in Study 1, and 16 subjects (8 men, 8 women; mean Age 29±6 years) participated in Study 2. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were identical for both studies. Subjects younger than 25 years of age were excluded from participating in the study. Additional exclusion criteria were age >65 years, pregnancy, personal or family history of major psychiatric disorders, use of medications that may interfere with the study medication, chronic or acute physical illness, tobacco smoking (>10 cigarettes/day), and a lifetime prevalence of illicit drug use >10 times. Subjective effects were measured using validated psychometric tools including visual analog scales, adjective mood rating scale and the altered states of consciousness scale. Heart rate, blood pressure, and pupil size were also recorded. Further, we measured plasma concentration of LSD and its main metabolites in both studies to investigate pharmacokinetic ‐ pharmacodynamic relationships. Results: LSD produced positively‐experienced derealization and depersonalization and visual restructuralization including synaesthesia after 100 μg and 200 LSD in a dose‐dependent manner. Additionally, LSD produced empathic effects such as “closeness” “openness”, and “trust”. Empathic effects were found higher after 200 μg than after 100 μg. Subjective effects after 200 μg lasted up to 12 hours, and up to 10 hours after 100 μg. Negative associated effects, mainly transient anxiety, were more pronounced under 200 μg than after 100 μg. LSD did also moderately increase systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body temperature, and pupil size. LSD did not produce fearful reactions or negative experiences in this controlled setting. Conclusion: LSD induced mainly positive subjective effects in a dose‐dependent manner in a controlled laboratory setting in healthy subjects. Our findings show that 100 μg and 200 μg of LSD induce empathic effects to different degrees which is an important finding regarding its potential use in psycholytic therapy.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"2244","Major depression: The relative contribution of gender, MDMA, and cannabis use.^\nPrevious research has suggested that 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy) users have elevated depressive symptomatology, although it is not clear whether this is due to MDMA or other drug use. This study aimed to investigate the contributions of MDMA and cannabis use to Major Depressive Disorder in MDMA users. A total of 226 MDMA users were studied. Participants (65% male) reported an average number of 35.8 uses of MDMA (SD = 45.6, range = 2-400). Participants were administered a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Twenty-six individuals (11.5%) met lifetime criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. High rates of lifetime Cannabis Abuse (30.1%) and Cannabis Dependence (12.4%) were reported. No association was found between number of uses of MDMA and Major Depressive Disorder. Those with lifetime major depression were found, however, to have higher rates of lifetime cannabis use disorder (adjusted OR = 2.40). A logistic regression indicated that lifetime cannabis use disorder, but not MDMA use, was significantly associated with lifetime Major Depressive Disorder. Stratified analyses suggested that for males, neither drug use variable was associated with major depression. For females, a lifetime cannabis use disorder (adjusted OR = 4.99), but not MDMA use, was associated with lifetime Major Depressive Disorder. Results of this study suggest that although MDMA use was not found to be significantly associated with major depression for either gender, a lifetime cannabis use disorder was significantly associated with lifetime major depression for female, but not male, users of MDMA.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"2477","The effects of esketamine and treatment expectation in acute major depressive disorder (Expect): study protocol for a pharmacological fMRI study using a balanced placebo design.^\nBACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent (8-15%), severely disabling disorder and is associated with enormous socioeconomic impact. Antidepressant medication for the treatment of MDD has proven effective in RCTs; however, placebo response is also substantial. Given the potential benefits of modulating the placebo response in patient care and pharmacological research, understanding the mechanisms underlying placebo response is of high clinical relevance. The placebo response is mediated by treatment expectation, i.e. an individual's belief about whether and how much they will improve as a consequence of their treatment. The mechanisms and moderators of treatment expectation effects in MDD are poorly understood. Initial brain imaging studies on placebo responses in MDD point towards the relevance of the lateral prefrontal cortex and the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC). In this project, we will investigate the neural mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects of treatment expectation associated with the fast-acting antidepressant esketamine in patients with MDD. Esketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist inducing antidepressant effects within hours. METHODS: We will employ a fully balanced placebo design with the factors ""treatment"" (i.v. esketamine / placebo) and verbally induced ""expectation"" (high / low) combined with fMRI (resting state, emotion and reward processing paradigms) to investigate the psychological and neural mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects of expectation, and how these interact with the pharmacological effects of esketamine. DISCUSSION: The insights gained by this project promise fundamental implications for clinical treatment and future drug trials. Unraveling the mechanisms underlying expectation effects on antidepressant treatment may inform (1) strategies to modulate these effects and thus improve assay sensitivity in RCTs and (2) novel treatment regiments aiming to maximize the synergistic effects of expectation and pharmacological treatment in the clinical care of patients with MDD.

"2669","Modulation of simultaneously collected hemodynamic and electrophysiological functional connectivity by ketamine and midazolam.^\nThe pharmacological modulation of functional connectivity in the brain may underlie therapeutic efficacy for several neurological and psychiatric disorders. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides a noninvasive method of assessing this modulation, however, the indirect nature of the blood-oxygen level dependent signal restricts the discrimination of neural from physiological contributions. Here we followed two approaches to assess the validity of fMRI functional connectivity in developing drug biomarkers, using simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG)/fMRI in a placebo-controlled, three-way crossover design with ketamine and midazolam. First, we compared seven different preprocessing pipelines to determine their impact on the connectivity of common resting-state networks. Independent components analysis (ICA)-denoising resulted in stronger reductions in connectivity after ketamine, and weaker increases after midazolam, than pipelines employing physiological noise modelling or averaged signals from cerebrospinal fluid or white matter. This suggests that pipeline decisions should reflect a drug's unique noise structure, and if this is unknown then accepting possible signal loss when choosing extensive ICA denoising pipelines could engender more confidence in the remaining results. We then compared the temporal correlation structure of fMRI to that derived from two connectivity metrics of EEG, which provides a direct measure of neural activity. While electrophysiological estimates based on the power envelope were more closely aligned to BOLD signal connectivity than those based on phase consistency, no significant relationship between the change in electrophysiological and hemodynamic correlation structures was found, implying caution should be used when making cross-modal comparisons of pharmacologically-modulated functional connectivity.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Report of three cases from a placebo-controlled trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Animal studies suggest that neural plasticity may play a role in the antidepressant effects of a single ketamine dose. However, the potential effects of repeated ketamine treatments on human neuroplasticity are unknown. METHODS: This pilot RCT study measured plasticity-induced changes before and after a ketamine course, in three treatment-resistant depressed subjects, who were randomized to receive 8 intranasal treatments of 100mg ketamine or 4.5mg midazolam. Mood ratings were performed by a trained blinded rater at baseline and 24h-48h after the ketamine course, using the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Neuroplasticity was assessed in the motor cortex using a paired associative stimulation (PAS) paradigm at baseline and 24h-48h after the treatment course. No changes in current psychotropic medication or dosage were permitted for 4weeks prior to trial entry and throughout the trial. RESULTS: The subject receiving ketamine, but not those receiving midazolam, presented a marked increase in neural plasticity after the treatment course. However, mood changes were not associated with changes in neural plasticity. LIMITATIONS: Pilot study with small sample size. Concomitant antidepressant medications taken. Plasticity was tested in the motor cortex only, thus the generalizability of these findings to other brain areas cannot be assumed. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a course of intranasal ketamine may enhance synaptic plasticity in subjects with depression, but this was not associated with antidepressant effects. Further research on this topic is warranted.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"2913","Ecstasy use and depression: A 4-year longitudinal study among an Australian general community sample.^\nRationale: Longitudinal, population-based studies can better assess the relationship of ecstasy use with depression. Objectives: We examined whether change in ecstasy use was associated with change in depressive symptoms/probable depression over a 4-year period, among a large Australian sample. Methods: The Personality and Total Health project is a longitudinal general community study of Australians from Canberra and Queanbeyan. Data from the youngest cohort when aged 24-30 (N = 2, 128) and 4 years later (N = 1, 977) was included. The Goldberg depression scale and the Brief Patient Health Questionnaire measured depressive symptoms and probable depression, respectively. Multilevel growth models also considered demographics, psychosocial characteristics, and other drug use. Results: Ecstasy use was not associated with long-term depressive symptoms or greater odds of depression in multivariate analyses. Users had more self-reported depressive symptoms when using ecstasy compared to not using. However, differences between people who had and had not ever used ecstasy largely accounted for this. Other factors were more important in the prediction of depression. Conclusions: It would be premature to conclude that ecstasy use is not related to the development of long-term depressive symptoms, given the relatively low level of ecstasy and other drug use in this community sample. Results showed that other factors need to be considered when investigating ecstasy use and depression. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"2998","Ketamine's dose-related effects on anxiety symptoms in patients with treatment refractory anxiety disorders.^\nThe N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine has rapid onset activity in treatment-resistant depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. Due to similarities in brain network activity in depression and anxiety disorders, we hypothesized that ketamine might also be active in other refractory anxiety disorders. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of ketamine in 12 patients with refractory generalized anxiety disorder and/or social anxiety disorder who were not currently depressed, using an ascending single dose study design (0.25, 0.5, 1 mg/kg administered subcutaneously) at weekly intervals. Within 1 h of dosing, patients reported reduced anxiety, which persisted for up to seven days. A dose-response profile was noted for anxiolytic effects, dissociative side effects, and changes in blood pressure and heart rate, with minor changes at 0.25 mg/kg, and progressively greater and more durable changes at the higher doses. Ten of 12 patients were treatment responders at 0.5-1 mg/kg. Ketamine was safe and well tolerated in this population. Ketamine may be a potential therapeutic alternative for patients with refractory generalized anxiety disorder/social anxiety disorder. Along with its demonstrated effectiveness in patients with treatment-resistant depression, obsessive compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, these data raise the intriguing possibility that ketamine may have broad efficacy in disorders characterized by negative emotional states, and that these disorders may share a common precipitating neurobiology.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Here, we expand upon the previous report of primary outcomes from a phase 2 study of COMP360 in individuals with TRD-the largest randomised controlled clinical trial of psilocybin-to discuss findings of the exploratory efficacy endpoints. METHODS: In this phase 2, double-blind trial, 233 participants with TRD were randomised to receive a single dose of psilocybin 25 mg, 10 mg, or 1 mg (control), administered alongside psychological support from trained therapists. Efficacy measures assessed patient-reported depression severity, anxiety, positive and negative affect, functioning and associated disability, quality of life, and cognitive function. RESULTS: At Week 3, psilocybin 25 mg, compared with 1 mg, was associated with greater improvements from Baseline total scores in all measures. The 10 mg dose produced smaller effects across these measures. LIMITATIONS: Interpretation of this trial is limited by the absence of an active comparator and the possibility of functional unblinding in participants who received a low dose of psilocybin. CONCLUSIONS: Three weeks after dosing, psilocybin 25 mg and, to a lesser degree, 10 mg improved measures of patient-reported depression severity, anxiety, affect, and functioning. These results extend the primary findings from the largest randomised clinical trial of psilocybin for TRD to examine other outcomes that are of importance to patients.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"3149","Adjunctive music improves the tolerability of intravenous ketamine for bipolar depression.^\nIntravenous ketamine is an effective treatment of bipolar depression. One of its most important side-effects is a transient altered state of consciousness commonly referred to as dissociation. These states can be anxiety-provoking, distressing and even treatment-limiting, warranting research into mitigation strategies. In this article, we present two cases that demonstrate the potential of adjunctive music to diminish the distress associated with ketamine-induced dissociation—though not necessarily its degree—in bipolar 1 disorder. Both patients suffering from severe depression underwent their first ketamine infusion without music and opted for music with subsequent infusions. They reported that music significantly improved the tolerance of their dissociative symptoms, thereby reducing distress and facilitating subsequent treatments. Both patients achieved remission from their highly treatment-resistant depressive episodes following six ketamine infusions. This is the first report of music’s benefits on ketamine for bipolar 1 depression, though there is precedence in the scientific literature on ‘psychedelics’ where the use of music in combination with medication-induced altered states has been studied. The principles regarding music selection that have resulted from this paradigm may be applicable to the use of ketamine in unipolar and bipolar depression. The optimal use of music with ketamine warrants further research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"3277","44. Acute Effects of MDMA on Negative Affective Brain Circuit Function: a Randomized Controlled Mechanistic Trial.^\nBackground: 3,4‐Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) has been shown to reduce interpersonal defensiveness, but the neural mechanisms by which it promotes enhanced trust and openness are not well understood. Methods: In a novel, double‐blinded, randomized, cross‐over design, 17 healthy subjects aged 18 to 55 years (mean=40.8 years, 62.5% female) received two doses of oral MDMA (120mg or 80mg), as well as placebo, 10 days apart. We used functional neuroimaging to assess key regions of the brain’s negative affective circuit during implicit processing of social threat stimuli ∼90 minutes post‐drug administration and assessed participant experience using scales and free report at multiple time points. Results: Initial analyses showed a dose‐dependent decrease in activation of amygdala (F=4.51, p=0.02, pFDR=0.04) and anterior insula (F=15.6, pFDR<0.001) in response to angry faces. This decrease was most pronounced for female compared to male participants (amygdala, pFDR=0.007; anterior insula pFDR=0.04). We observed accompanying dose‐dependent increases in wanting to be with others (p=0.003) and feeling loving (p=0.01) and empathetic and trusting (p=0.01). Illustrative free reports showed: “I was feeling forgiveness and acceptance rather than just thinking it” and “I’m feeling a deeper understanding of how trauma changes the brain”. Conclusions: Our findings shed light on the neural circuit mechanisms by which MDMA may help modulate responses to social threat and, as a result, lower defensive reactions and promote a sense of trust and connection. These results make progress toward an understanding of the therapeutic mechanisms of MDMA in disorders characterized by threat reactivity and the neural targets that can be used in precision medicine trials.

We sought to extend these findings by investigating the extent to which ecstasy/polydrug users manifest executive deficits in everyday life. Methods:: Forty-two current ecstasy/polydrug users, 18 previous (abstinent for at least 6 months) ecstasy/polydrug users, and 50 non-users of ecstasy (including both non-users of any illicit drug and some cannabis-only users) completed the self-report Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult Version (BRIEF-A) measure. Results:: Current ecstasy/polydrug users performed significantly worse than previous users and non-users on subscales measuring inhibition, self-monitoring, initiating action, working memory, planning, monitoring ongoing task performance, and organizational ability. Previous ecstasy/polydrug users did not differ significantly from non-users. In regression analyses, although the current frequency of ecstasy use accounted for statistically significant unique variance on 3 of the 9 BRIEF-A subscales, daily cigarette consumption was the main predictor in 6 of the subscales. Conclusions:: Current ecstasy/polydrug users report more executive dysfunction than do previous users and non-users. This finding appears to relate to some aspect of ongoing ecstasy use and seems largely unrelated to the use of other illicit drugs. An unexpected finding was the association of current nicotine consumption with executive dysfunction.

Using an open label, within-subjects protocol, 15 males and 5 females (mean age = 30.8 years) were administered three fixed, stepwise increasing sub-anaesthetic doses of intravenous (IV) ketamine solution [(i) 8 mg/h IV infusion plus 30 mg bolus, (ii) 12 mg/h IV infusion and (iii) 20 mg/h infusion]. Whole blood ketamine and norketamine concentrations were determined at each treatment step and at 2 h post-infusion. Driving performance was assessed at baseline, at each treatment step and at 2 h post-treatment using a validated computerised driving simulator. Standard Deviation of Lateral Position (SDLP) and Steering Variability (SV) were assessed. Linear Fixed Effect Modelling indicated a main effect for time (dose) for SDLP (F[4,72] = 33.22, p < 0.0001) and SV (F[4,72] = 4.65, p < 0.002). Post-hoc analyses revealed significant differences from baseline at each treatment step for SDLP (all p < 0.001), and for 12 mg/h treatment step for SV (p = 0.049). Post-treatment driving performance returned to baseline levels. Weak positive linear associations were observed between SDLP and whole blood ketamine concentrations (R2 = 0.11, β = 29.96, p = 0.001) and norketamine (R² = 0.09, β = 28.87, p = 0.003). These findings suggest that even under highly controlled conditions, ketamine intoxication significantly alters simulated driving performance. At the highest dose, ketamine produced changes to SDLP considered incompatible with safe driving, highlighting how ketamine consumption may translate to an increased risk of road trauma.

"4152","Psychedelics for treatment resistant depression: are they game changers?.^\nINTRODUCTION: A new era of treatment for adults with treatment-resistant depression (TRD), which involves psychedelic substances, is dawning. Emerging evidence indicates that psychedelics can exert antidepressant effects through multiple neurobiological and psychological mechanisms. However, it remains to be seen if these new treatments will revolutionize the treatment of TRD. AREAS COVERED: The present review focuses on the efficacy of serotoninergic psychedelics psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), ayahuasca, 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) and mescaline (3,4,5-trimethoxyphenethylamine), as well as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), for TRD. A systematic search was conducted for psilocybin in TRD as emerging trials had not yet been subject to review. A narrative review summarized findings on other psychedelics. EXPERT OPINION: Psychedelic therapy has created a paradigm shift in the treatment of TRD, as it can maximize therapeutic benefits and minimize potential risks. Psilocybin holds promise as a potential game-changer in the treatment of TRD, with initial evidence suggesting a rapid antidepressant effect sustained for some responders for at least 3 months. Nevertheless, further adequately powered, double-blind, comparator-controlled trials are required to explore and clarify the mechanisms of action and long-term effects of psychedelics in TRD. Psychedelics also hold promise for other psychiatric conditions, such as bipolar depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"4424","Psychedelic therapy for depressive symptoms: A systematic review and meta-analysis.^\nBACKGROUND: Psychedelic therapy shows promise for Major Depressive Disorder, especially when treatment-resistant, as well as life-threatening illness distress. The objective of this systematic review, inclusive of meta-analysis, is to examine recent clinical research on the therapeutic effects of classic psychedelics on depressive symptoms. METHODS: Fourteen psychedelic therapy studies, utilising psilocybin, ayahuasca, or LSD, were systematically reviewed. For the meta-analysis, standardised mean differences were calculated for seven randomised controlled trials. RESULTS: The systematic review indicated significant short- and long-term reduction of depressive symptoms in all conditions studied after administration of psilocybin, ayahuasca, or LSD, with psychological support. In the meta-analysis, symptom reduction was significantly indicated in three timepoints out of four, including 1-day, 1-week, and 3-5 weeks, supporting the results of the systematic review, with the exception of the 6-8 weeks follow-up point which was less conclusive. LIMITATIONS: The absence of required data for 2 studies necessitated the less precise use of graphical extraction and imputation. The small sample size in all but one study negatively affected the statistical power. None of the studies had long-term follow-up without also utilising the cross-over method, which did not allow for long-term results to be included in the meta-review. CONCLUSIONS: This review indicates an association between psychedelic therapy and significant reduction of depressive symptoms at several time points. However, the small number of studies, and low sample sizes, calls for careful interpretation of results. This suggests the need for more randomised clinical trials of psychedelic therapy, with larger and more diverse samples.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"4635","Inhibition of MDMA-induced increase in cortisol does not prevent acute impairment of verbal memory.^\nBACKGROUND: Ecstasy use is commonly linked with memory deficits in abstinent ecstasy users. Similar impairments are being found during ecstasy intoxication after single doses of ± 3,4 metylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). The concordance of memory impairments during intoxication and abstinence suggests a similar neuropharmacological mechanism underlying acute and chronic memory impairments. The mechanism underlying this impairment is to date not known. We hypothesized that cortisol might play an important role in this mechanism as cortisol, implicated in the regulation of memory performance, can be brought out of balance by stressors like MDMA. METHODS: In the present study, we aimed to block the MDMA-induced acute memory defect by giving participants a cortisol synthesis inhibitor (metyrapone) together with a single dose of MDMA. Seventeen polydrug MDMA users entered this placebo-controlled within subject study with four treatment conditions. The treatments consisted of MDMA (75 mg) and metyrapone (750 mg), alone and in combination, and double placebo. Pre-treatment with metyrapone or Placebo occurred 1 h prior to MDMA or Placebo administration. Memory performance was tested at peak drug concentrations by means of several memory tests. Cortisol levels were determined in blood and oral fluid; this served as a control measure to see whether manipulations were effective. RESULTS: Main findings indicated that whereas treatment with metyrapone blocked the expected MDMA-induced increase in cortisol levels in blood, it did not prevent the MDMA-induced memory deficit from happening. CONCLUSION: We therefore conclude that MDMA-induced increments in cortisol concentrations are not related to MDMA-induced memory impairments.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"4678","Classic Psychedelic Use and Mechanisms of Mental Health: Exploring the Mediating Roles of Spirituality and Emotion Processing on Symptoms of Anxiety, Depressed Mood, and Disordered Eating in a Community Sample.^\nA resurgence of research has begun to systematically examine the relationship between psychedelic use and mental health and well-being. Although preliminary findings examining the therapeutic value of these substances show promise, the mechanisms through which psychedelic use may predict reduced mental distress remain poorly understood. To this end, we surveyed a community sample of individuals (n = 159) who endorsed lifetime psychedelic use to examine relationships among psychedelic use and self-reported spirituality, difficulties in emotion regulation, and symptoms of mental health issues. Results revealed a pathway through which classic psychedelic use predicted greater spirituality, which in turn predicted better emotion regulation, ultimately predicting lower levels of anxiety, depressed mood, and disordered eating. These results contribute to our understanding of potential mechanisms of change with respect to psychedelics and mental health. They also add to the growing body of literature pointing to the healing effects of the cultivation of spirituality and emotion regulation as separate and related constructs.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"4884","Group format psychedelic-assisted therapy interventions: Observations and impressions from the HOPE trial.^\nBackground: Psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy has demonstrated significant promise as a treatment for depression, anxiety, and existential distress associated with serious medical illness and has generally been employed on an individual basis, which presents challenges for scaling and resource availability. There are also compelling theoretical reasons to suggest that group-based formats-if utilized in a thoughtful fashion-might offer unique or enhanced therapeutic benefits for certain conditions or populations. The HOPE trial is an IRB-approved open-label feasibility and safety pilot study of psi-locybin enhanced group therapy in patients with a DSM-5 depressive disorder associated with a cancer diagnosis completed at the Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) in Salt Lake City, Utah (HOPE: A Pilot Study of Psilocybin Enhanced Group Psychotherapy in Patients with Cancer). We report here quali-tative survey-based data, impressions, and suggestions for group-based psychedelic-assisted therapy interventions based on our observations to inform future studies. Methods: Patients with a DSM-5 depressive disorder with an underlying cancer diagnosis were recruited from HCI by referral from oncology providers, palliative care, and social work. Following screening and consenting, 4-6 partici-pants per cohort (with three total cohorts) were enrolled in a protocol involving 3 120 min group preparatory sessions, a single high-dose (25 mg) group psilocybin session, and 3 subsequent group integration sessions. Primary clinical outcomes are still in process of data collection and analysis. Qualitative data was gathered from patient written reports and a survey administered at 2 weeks post intervention. Qualitative reports were also gathered from the therapist team at a post-study group process session. Findings: We report here results from a qualitative survey of participant experiences with group format study design, as well as impressions and guidelines for group format and group psychotherapeutic process to inform other studies pursuing group-based interventions in psychedelic therapy. Suggestions are provided for protocol design, screening processes, space considerations, therapist team structure, group process, music, timeline, as well as potential issues and challenges.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"4943","Mental disorders in ecstasy users: A prospective-longitudinal investigation.^\nObjectives: To investigate the relationship between ecstasy use and mental disorders in a representative sample of adolescents and young adults. Method: Data for this investigation were drawn from the Early Developmental Stages of Psychopathology (EDSP) study, an epidemiological-longitudinal study in which 14-24 year-olds were examined prospectively over a period of about 4 years. Results are based on N=2462 participants who completed the whole study period and for whom drug use behavior could be determined. Results: (1) Ecstasy users, compared with non-users, were at significantly increased risk of DSM-IV substance related disorders, including alcohol use disorders (52.6 vs. 15.6%; OR=5.6, 95% CI=3.8-8.1). Further, ecstasy users also had a higher risk of alcohol use disorders, when compared with users of other illicit substances (52.6 vs. 40.3%; OR=1.7, 95% CI=1.1-2.4). (2) Ecstasy users had significantly higher rates for almost all DSM-IV mental disorders examined when compared with non-users (any non-substance use disorder: 68.7 vs. 44.5%; OR=3.1, 95% CI=2.1-4.4) and compared with users of other illicit drugs (any non substance use disorder: 68.7 vs. 55.5%; OR=1.8, 95% CI=1.2-2.6). (3) Ecstasy users also reported significantly higher rates of prescription medicine use, though they did not use more medical services than non-drug users. (4) Analyses of temporal patterns of ecstasy use and disorder onset revealed that the first use of ecstasy was secondary to the onset of DSM-IV mental disorders in the majority of cases. Still, subjects with mental disorders at baseline also showed a significantly increased risk for initiation of ecstasy use during the 4-year follow-up period. Conclusions: Care should be taken in cross sectional studies in interpreting mental disorder signs and symptoms merely as a consequence of ecstasy use, as ecstasy use might be associated with the use of multiple substances, and onset of mental disorder is more likely to precede rather than to follow use of ecstasy and related substances. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

"5215","Chronic opioid therapy modifies QST changes after ketamine infusion in chronic pain patients.^\nThe long-term effects of opioids on sensitization processes are believed to be mediated through the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor. Quantitative sensory testing (QST) changes observed after a ketamine infusion have been previously described but the effect that chronic opioids will have is not known. The results of this prospective randomized factorial trial compared the thermal QST changes observed after a .05 mg/kg ketamine infusion or a saline placebo in chronic pain subjects who were either opioid-naive or were chronically using opioids for chronic noncancer pain are presented. No baseline QST differences were noted between the 4 groups at baseline. Comparison of changes preinfusion with postinfusion QST measurements resulted in decreased average change in temporal summation response between opioid subjects who received a placebo compared with those who received a ketamine infusion (−5.22, SD = 9.96 vs 13.81, SD = 19.55; P = .004). Additionally, the average change in temporal summation was decreased among subjects who received a ketamine infusion and were not chronically using opioids compared with subjects who were using chronic opioids and received a placebo infusion (−1.91, SD = 13.25 vs 13.81, SD = 19.55; P = .007). The results indicate that low-dose ketamine infusions produce subtle changes in QST phenotypes that are modified by the chronic use of opioids. This illustrates the potential diagnostic and therapeutic value of ketamine in the setting of chronic opioid use.

"5227","[Psychotherapy with Adjuvant use of Serotonergic Psychoactive Substances: Possibilities and Challenges].^\nBackground Recently, scientific interest in the therapeutic potential of serotonergic and psilocybin hallucinogens (psychedelics) such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and entactogens like 3,4-methylendioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) within the framework of psychotherapy has resumed. The present article provides an overview on the current evidence on substance-assisted psychotherapy with these substances. Method A selective search was carried out in the PubMed and Cochrane Library including studies investigating the clinical use of serotonergic psychoactive substances since 2000. Results Studies were found investigating the following indications: alcohol (LSD and psilocybin) and tobacco addiction (psilocybin), anxiety and depression in patients suffering from life-threatening somatic illness (LSD and psilocybin), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (psilocybin), treatment-resistant major depression (psilocybin), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (MDMA). Discussion Substance use disorders, PTSD and anxiety and depression in patients suffering from life-threatening somatic illness belong to the indications with the best evidence for substance-assisted psychotherapy with serotonergic psychoactive agents. To date, studies indicate efficacy and relatively good tolerability. Further studies are needed to determine whether these substances may represent suitable and effective treatment options for some treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders in the future.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"5646","Pattern of cannabis use in ecstasy polydrug users: moderate cannabis use may compensate for self-rated aggression and somatic symptoms.^\nCannabis is one of the most common 'co-drugs' for ecstasy users. The aim of the present study was to explore self-reported psychobiological problems in ecstasy polydrug users in relation to their pattern of cannabis use. Two hundred and eighty ecstasy polydrug users were allocated into five cannabis groups according to the frequency of their cannabis use. The control group comprised 121 alcohol-tobacco users. There were no significant group differences with regard to age, diagnosed family psychiatric history and level of self-rated stress experienced during 6 months prior to the study. The present study produced three main findings: (a) Ecstasy users with no concomitant use of cannabis displayed more self-rated aggression and somatic symptoms compared with ecstasy users who were smoking cannabis on a monthly or weekly basis. (b) Ecstasy users who reported heavy cannabis use in the past displayed higher paranoid symptoms compared with ecstasy weekly and daily cannabis users. (c) Former heavy cannabis users were the most likely to complain of a variety of ecstasy related long-term problems. In conclusion, moderate cannabis use may help to ameliorate or mask MDMA-induced aggressivity and somatic symptoms. However, this study confirms that heavy cannabis and ecstasy use is associated with several psychobiological problems, which may emerge after a period of abstinence from both drugs.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"5723","Effect of local wound infiltration with ketamine versus dexmedetomidine on postoperative pain and stress after abdominal hysterectomy, a randomized trial.^\nBackground and Objectives: Postoperative pain and stress elicit hormonal changes. We aimed at comparing the effects of wound infiltration with ketamine versus dexmedetomidine on postoperative pain and stress response. Methods: This double‐blinded study included ninety patients scheduled for total abdominal hysterectomy and were randomly assigned into three groups to receive local wound infiltration with 40 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine (group C), plus 2 mg/kg ketamine (group K) or 2 μg/kg dexmedetomidine (group D). Primary outcome was postoperative morphine consumption; secondary outcomes included first request of analgesia, VAS scores at rest and movement (VAS–R/M) and side effects. Serum cortisol, prolactin and glucose levels at baseline, pre‐infiltration, 6 and 24 h postoperatively were measured. Results: Rescue analgesia was less in K (6.80 ± 3.19 mg) and D (8.39 ± 3.86 mg) compared to C (13.33 ± 4.01 mg) (p < 0.05). First request of analgesia was delayed in K (7.60 ± 4.16 h) and D (6.00 ± 3.73 h) compared to C (4.20 ± 1.13 h) (p < 0.05). Both VAS and R/M were significantly lower in K (all over 24 h) and D (for 8 and 4 h, respectively) compared to C. Stress markers were significantly lower in K and D compared to C at 6 and 24 h, and in K compared to D at 24 h (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Local wound infiltration with ketamine or dexmedetomidine added to bupivacaine had an opioid‐sparing effect, delayed first request of rescue analgesia, and attenuated postoperative stress response, especially with ketamine in patients underwent total abdominal hysterectomy.

"5928","Evidence that subanesthetic doses of ketamine cause sustained disruptions of NMDA and AMPA-mediated frontoparietal connectivity in humans.^\nFollowing the discovery of the antidepressant properties of ketamine, there has been a recent resurgence in the interest in this NMDA receptor antagonist. Although detailed animal models of the molecular mechanisms underlying ketamine’s effects have emerged, there are few MEG/EEG studies examining the acute subanesthetic effects of ketamine infusion in man. We recorded 275 channel MEG in two experiments (n = 25 human males) examining the effects of subanesthetic ketamine infusion. MEG power spectra revealed a rich set of significant oscillatory changes compared with placebo sessions, including decreases in occipital, parietal, and anterior cingulate alpha power, increases in medial frontal theta power, and increases in parietal and cingulate cortex high gamma power. Each of these spectral effects demonstrated their own set of temporal dynamics. Dynamic causal modeling of frontoparietal connectivity changes with ketamine indicated a decrease in NMDA and AMPA-mediated frontal-to-parietal connectivity. AMPA-mediated connectivity changes were sustained for up to 50 min after ketamine infusion had ceased, by which time perceptual distortions were absent. The results also indicated a decrease in gain of parietal pyramidal cells, which was correlated with participants’ self-reports of blissful state. Based on these results, we suggest that the antidepressant effects of ketamine may depend on its ability to change the balance of frontoparietal connectivity patterns.

Clonidine is a centrally acting alpha2‐receptor agonist and sympatholytic which attenuates the release of NE from presynaptic nerve terminals and also lowers NE plasma concentration. To determine the role of NE in the response to MDMA in humans we test the effects of a clonidine pretreatment on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of MDMA. We use a randomized double‐blind placebo‐controlled cross‐over design with four experimental sessions. Clonidine (150 μg) or placebo will be administered 1 h before the administration of MDMA (125 mg) or placebo to 16 healthy volunteers.

"6035","Randomized, Double-blind, Active-placebo Controlled Study of MDMA-assisted Psychotherapy in People With Chronic PTSD.^\nPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating disorder that develops after people undergo a traumatic event, such as a rape, car accident or other life‐threatening event. PTSD is a worldwide health problem. Psychotherapy or drugs are used to treat PTSD, but there is an interest in developing other treatment options. 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)‐assisted psychotherapy is one potential treatment. MDMA is known as the active ingredient in ""ecstasy."" It was used along with psychotherapy to treat people in the past, and a study suggests that MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy might help people with PTSD. This Phase 2 research study will investigate the safety and efficacy of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy in 10 people with chronic, treatment‐resistant posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). After open‐label lead‐in in two subjects there will be a randomized, double‐blind arm comparing 125 vs. 25 mg MDMA in eight participants, and an open‐label arm for participants who received active placebo. In this study, five people will be randomly assigned to receive the full dose of 125 and 62.5 mg MDMA and three will be randomized to receive the active placebo dose of 25 and 125. mg MDMA. MDMA will be administered during two six to eight hour long experimental sessions scheduled three to five weeks apart. Study subjects will have a medical and psychiatric examination and a measure of their PTSD symptoms to make sure they meet the criteria to be in the study. Subjects must be in good physical health. They will also complete questionnaires about their PTSD symptoms, symptoms of depression and sleep quality. These tests will be given by a researcher who will not be present during any of the therapy sessions. This same researcher will give the subject the same tests or measures two months after the second experimental session and 12 months after a final experimental session. Once enrolled, subjects will have three preparatory sessions with a team of two therapists, one male and one female. The same team of therapists will work with them throughout the entire study. The subject will learn more about MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy and the therapists will learn more about the subject's goals, hopes and fears. Starting from the second preparatory session, subjects will answer questions on thoughts about hurting or killing themselves; these questions will be asked during face to face contact this and on two of the contact days, which may occur over the telephone. Subjects will have to stop taking their psychiatric medication before they have their first experimental session, with exact times dependent upon the specific medications involved. Subjects and the therapists, but not the person measuring symptoms, will find out if the subject had the active placebo or full dose of MDMA at this time, and if the subject had the active placebo, they can start the second arm of the study. What happens during this arm is very similar to the arm except that the subject and therapists will know the subject is getting a full dose of MDMA. Twelve months after the subject's final follow‐up visit (two months after their final experimental session), PTSD symptoms, symptoms of depression and sleep quality will be assessed again, and subjects will complete an additional questionnaire about their experiences during and after the study. The study will compare PTSD symptoms before and after MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy with a full dose and therapy with an active placebo dose of MDMA. Both therapists will be present for each experimental session. During experimental sessions, subjects will be encouraged to confront trauma‐related thoughts, feelings and memories. Blood pressure, heart rate (pulse) and body temperature will be measured regularly, and the researchers will periodically ask the subject to rate his or her degree of distress. Subjects will stay overnight at the clinic and have their first integrative session, where they will examine what happened during their experimental session. They will have two more integrative ses ions until they have their next experimental session. Subjects will fill out a questionnaire on their PTSD symptoms on every third integrative session. Two months after the second experimental session, subjects will answer questions or complete questionnaires about PTSD symptoms, symptoms of depression and sleep quality, and one of the researchers will assess their general psychological function.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"

"6121","A Multi-Site Phase 3 Study of MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy for PTSD II.^\nPTSD is a serious debilitating disorder that negatively impacts a person's daily life. PTSD is a stress‐related psychiatric condition that may occur following a traumatic event such as war, disaster, sexual abuse, violence, terrorism, and accidents. PTSD negatively impacts a person's daily life, resulting in relationship difficulties, difficulty in finding and maintaining a job, reduced cognitive and psychosocial functioning, substance abuse, high‐cost healthcare use, and increased depression and suicide risk. Available PTSD treatments, including medications and therapy, effectively treat only a fraction of people who try them for adequate dose and duration. People with PTSD can be treated with psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies. In the past decade, there has been a growing amount of research into medications and other methods that may augment the effectiveness of psychotherapy for PTSD. 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a drug that releases serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain and indirectly increases levels of the neurohormones oxytocin, arginine vasopressin and cortisol. The combined neurobiological effects of MDMA increase compassion, reduce defenses and fear of emotional injury, and enhance communication and introspection. MDMA produces anxiolytic and prosocial effects, which counteract avoidance and hyperarousal in the context of therapy. A combined treatment of MDMA and psychotherapy may be especially useful for treating PTSD. This multi‐site, double‐blind, randomized Phase 3 study assesses the efficacy and safety of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy versus psychotherapy with placebo control in participants diagnosed with at least severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The study will be conducted in N ≈ 100 participants. Participants will be enrolled in one of two groups at a 1:1 ratio. A flexible dose of MDMA or placebo, followed by a supplemental half‐dose unless contraindicated, is administered during the Treatment Period with manualized psychotherapy in three monthly Experimental Sessions. This 12‐week Treatment Period is preceded by three Preparatory Sessions. During the Treatment Period, each Experimental Session is followed by three Integrative Sessions of non‐drug psychotherapy. The Primary Outcome measure is change in Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM 5 (CAPS‐5) from Baseline. Exploratory measures will address specific symptoms, or behavior that is sometimes related to PTSD. Drug safety will be assessed by measuring blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature during experimental sessions, collecting adverse events and measuring suicidal thoughts or behaviors with the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS). This study will compare the effects of three manualized Experimental Sessions of psychotherapy supported by assisted by flexible doses of MDMA versus placebo. Initial doses per Experimental Session include 80 mg or 120 mg of MDMA compounded with mannitol and magnesium stearate or placebo alone (mannitol and magnesium stearate), followed 1.5 to 2 hours later by a supplemental half‐dose (40 or 60 mg). Total amounts of MDMA to be administered per Experimental Session range from 80 mg to 180.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"6123","Ketamine's Effect Changes the Cortical Electrophysiological Activity Related to Semantic Affective Dimension of Pain.^\nKetamine is a unique anesthetic with neural effects that are distinct from more commonly‐used γ‐aminobutyric acid agonists. Evidence suggest that analgesic effect of ketamine is primarily related to the affective than the sensorial aspects of pain interpretation. The investigators investigated whether ketamine, a noncompetitive NMDA antagonist, would modify the perceived emotional valence of pain‐related words when compared to non‐pain‐related ones in healthy volunteers. Using a single session double‐blind parallel placebo‐controlled design, 24 healthy volunteers were randomized to receive intravenous S‐ketamine (n=12) or placebo (n=12). During infusion (plasmatic target of 60 ng/ml), the effects of ketamine were recorded using EEG and oddball behavioral data was monitored. Evoked potentials (N200 and P300 components) were recorded during performance of a semantic written word oddball task containing pain‐related (targets) and non‐pain‐related words (standards). Expected results: The findings of this study can help in the understanding of neurophysiologic mechanisms involved in ketamine's effects both in psychiatric diseases as in the treatment of postoperative acute and chronic pain.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"6191","Naturalistic Study of Microdosing With Psilocybin.^\nSub‐threshold doses of serotonergic psychedelics are frequently consumed as cognitive enhancers, and due to their purported positive effects on mood, energy and creativity (""microdosing""). The acute and short‐term effects of psilocybin (the psychoactive compound of Psilocybe cubensis mushrooms) on several variables will be investigated, comprising spontaneous and evoked electrophysiological brain activity, perception and cognitive function (cognitive flexibility, attention, inhibitory control, conscious access, visual perception), creativity (problem solving, divergent and convergent thinking), behavior (actigraphy and sleep patterns, natural language production) and several domains related to well‐being and mental health of the participants. This study is simultaneously naturalistic (i.e. recruited subjects are intrinsically motivated to microdose, as they have decided to embark in a microdosing protocol) and controlled by expectations, following a double‐blind placebo‐controlled design. Participants will microdose according to the following schedule: Two sessions (0.5 g dried Psilocybin mushrooms vs. dried edible mushroom material without psychoactive effects as a placebo condition) will be conducted. A third party will be in charge of generating their active dose and placebo capsules, and they will also implement a blinding procedure. Each session will span one week of measurements. Subjects will be given a smartwatch to monitor activity and sleeping patterns at the beginning of the week. At days 3 and 5, subjects will take capsules with active mushroom material or placebo, and then several variables will be recorded. Experiments will be conducted in a setting that is natural and comfortable for the participants, e.g. their homes. The main outcome measures consist of resting state activity recorded with EEG, evoked response potentials and performance during cognitive tasks, behavioral variables obtained with actigraphy and automated sleep scoring, natural language analysis, and several measurs self‐reported via standarized questionnaires. After completion, this study will provide direct evidence concerning the efficacy of microdosing for cognitive enhancement under natural conditions, i.e. those most frequently used by individuals who microdose, as well as provide information concerning the potential underlying neurobiological mechanisms.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"6321","Psychotomimetic effects of single-dose ketamine in children: exploring effects of age and alpha-2 agonist pretreatment.^\nBackground: Sub‐anesthetic doses of NMDA receptor antagonist drugs have been used for conscious sedation and treatment of pain and depression in humans, including clinical use in children for burn management and fracture reductions where ketamine offers less respiratory depression than a commonly used combination of midazolam‐fentanyl. However, NMDA antagonists like ketamine produce dosedependent, transient psychotomimetic effects in adult humans with limited safety data in children. Animal models used to measure NMDA antagonist‐induced neurotoxicity observed with sustained NMDA receptor blockade ‐along with limited clinical observations‐ suggest 1) that NMDA antagonist‐induced neurotoxicity and psychotomimetic effects may both be age dependent (i.e., expressed postpuberty) and 2) that certain treatments ‐like alpha‐2 adrenergic agonists‐ may attenuate NMDA antagonistinduced neurotoxicity, with initial experimental results in adult humans suggesting alpha‐2 adrenergic agonist attenuation of ketamine‐induced psychotomimetic effects. We report on a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study of the effect of the alpha‐2 agonist, dexmedetomidine, on the psychotomimetic effects of ketamine in children receiving single‐dose, sub‐anesthetic IV ketamine treatment for conscious sedation during limb fracture reductions in an emergency department (ED) setting. The study hypothesized 1) ketamine‐induced psychotomimetic effects, and 2) attenuation of psychotomimetic effects with a) younger age and b) pretreatment using dexmedetomidine. Methods: Children ages 7‐17 years undergoing clinically indicated ketamine sedation for orthopedic fracture reduction in the ED were randomized (stratified to achieve approximately equal numbers of <12 vs. >12 years‐of‐age children in each group) to co‐administration of dexmedetomidine versus placebo during sedation for ED management of fractures. Following initial pain control with oral oxycodone (0.2 mg/kg), medical assessments, patient stabilization, and informed consent, participants were administered dexmedetomidine (0.7 mcg/kg) or placebo, followed by 1.0 mg/kg of IV ketamine. Adverse events were recorded using a clinician‐administered adverse events and side effects scale. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale for Children (BPRSC) was administered prior to ketamine dose, during ketamine treatment, and again prior to discharge from the emergency room, with planned primary analysis focused on BPRS positive symptom change from the pre‐ketamine to on‐ketamine condition. Cognitive testing was obtained following on‐ketamine BPRS ratings. Analyses on BPRS subscale and other outcomes were performed using repeated measures ANOVA (ANCOVA when baseline values were non‐zero), using time as the repeated measure (pre‐ vs. during ketamine), and treatment condition (dexmedetomidine vs. saline) and age (<12 vs. >12) as independent variables. Results: Forty children (mean age: 11.0 years (SD = 2.3 years), 70.0% male, 22.5% black) were randomized to ketamine+saline (n =18) vs. ketamine+dexmedetomidine (n= 22). Ketamine treatment at these doses produced mild but statistically significant psychotomimetic effects, consistent with prior reports of dose‐dependent psychotomimetic effects in adult humans. BPRS positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, peculiar fantasies), absent in all subjects prior to ketamine treatment, were manifested during ketamine treatment, as indicated by a significant main effect of time (F[1,36] =19.98, p<0.0001). A trend‐level time by treatment by age interaction for BPRS positive symptoms was also observed (F[1,36]=3.93, p =0.055), explained by greater psychotomimetic effects in older children receiving ketamine without dexmedetomidine pre‐treatment. Frequently reported (>5%, baseline‐corrected) side effects were sedation (56.3%), dizziness (50.0%), “pleasant” dreams (31.4%) and visual hallucinations (29.7%). Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that singledose, sub‐anesthetic IV ketamine may be feasibly used n a well‐controlled ED setting for conscious sedation during medical procedures, with generally well‐tolerated adverse events, consistent with prior reports. However, ketamine treatment in children, as in adults, is associated with psychotomimetic effects. Trend level observations in this sample are also consistent with prior work in animals and humans suggesting 1) that younger children may be less susceptible to psychotomimetic effects and 2) that pretreatment with alpha‐2 agonists may attenuate NMDA antagonist induced effects on the brain. Future studies are needed to better characterize these effects.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"6366","Features of dissociation differentially predict antidepressant response to ketamine in treatment-resistant depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine induces rapid and robust antidepressant effects, and many patients also describe dissociation, which is associated with antidepressant response. This follow-up study investigated whether antidepressant efficacy is uniquely related to dissociative symptom clusters. METHODS: Treatment-resistant patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder (BD) (n = 126) drawn from three studies received a single subanesthetic (0.5 mg/kg) ketamine infusion. Dissociative effects were measured using the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS). Antidepressant response was measured using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). A confirmatory factor analysis established the validity of CADSS subscales (derealization, depersonalization, amnesia), and a general linear model with repeated measures was fitted to test whether subscale scores were associated with antidepressant response. RESULTS: Factor validity was supported, with a root mean square error of approximation of .06, a comparative fit index of .97, and a Tucker-Lewis index of .96. Across all studies and timepoints, the depersonalization subscale was positively related to HAM-D percent change. A significant effect of derealization on HAM-D percent change was observed at one timepoint (Day 7) in one study. The amnesia subscale was unrelated to HAM-D percent change. LIMITATIONS: Possible inadequate blinding; combined MDD/BD datasets might have underrepresented ketamine's antidepressant efficacy; the possibility of Type I errors in secondary analyses. CONCLUSIONS: From a psychometric perspective, researchers may elect to administer only the CADSS depersonalization subscale, given that it was most closely related to antidepressant response. From a neurobiological perspective, mechanistic similarities may exist between ketamine-induced depersonalization and antidepressant response, although off-target effects cannot be excluded.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"6496","Effects of low-dose ketamine on neuropathic pain: An electroencephalogram-electrooculogram/behavioral study.^\nThe aim of the present study was to clarify the neurophysiological changes associated with analgesic and behavioral effects of low-dose ketamine HCl in patients suffering from chronic neuropathic pain. Ten in-patients with neuropathic pain participated in this single-blind, placebo-controlled study after giving written informed consent. Following intravenous injections of a saline solution (placebo), three bolus injections of 5 mg ketamine HCl were administered at 5 min intervals. Changes in pain perception were assessed using a numerical rating scale for pain. Behavioral changes, including psychotomimetic effects, were assessed using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Electroencephalograms (EEG) and electrooculograms (EOG) were recorded continuously throughout the testing period. One minute EEG and closed-eye eye movements were quantified. The effects of ketamine were evaluated by comparing the neurophysiological and behavioral parameters obtained from the placebo and ketamine trials. Pain reduction was significantly correlated with ketamine-induced changes in hallucinatory behavior and excitement as measured by the BPRS. Ketamine injections caused a significant decrease in the EEGalpha amplitude without an accompanying reduction in EEG frequency. The EEGalpha amplitude reduction at the right central electrode was significantly related to subjective pain relief. Subanesthetic doses of ketamine significantly decreased rapid eye movements, but did not initiate slow eye movements. In conclusion, the present EEG-EOG/behavioral results indicate that ketamine-induced failure of neural integration between cortical-subcortical regions induces psychotic symptoms and alters pain perception on neuropathic pain.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"7278","Reduced N-acetylaspartate levels in the frontal cortex of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy) users: Preliminary results.^\nBACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The perceived safety of the recreational drug methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), or Ecstasy, conflicts with animal evidence indicating that MDMA damages cortical serotonin (5-HT) neurons at doses similar to those used by humans. Few data are available about the effects of MDMA on the human brain. This study was designed to evaluate MDMA-related alterations in metabolite ratios with single-voxel proton (1H) MR spectroscopy. METHODS: Fifteen male MDMA users (mean lifetime exposure, 723 tablets; mean time since last tablet, 12.0 weeks) and 12 age-matched control subjects underwent single-voxel 1H MR spectroscopy. N-Acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr), NAA/Choline (Cho), and myoinositol (MI)/Cr ratios were measured in midfrontal gray matter, midoccipital gray matter, and right parietal white matter. Data were analyzed with linear model-based multivariate analysis of variance. RESULTS: NAA/Cr (P = .04) and NAA/Cho (P = .03) ratios, markers associated with neuronal loss or dysfunction, were reduced in the frontal cortex of MDMA users. Neither NAA/Cr (P = .72) nor NAA/Cho (P = .12) ratios were different between both groups in occipital gray matter and parietal white matter (P = .18). Extent of previous MDMA use and frontal cortical NAA/Cr (ρ = -.50, P = .012) or NAA/Cho (ρ = -.550, P < .01) ratios were significantly associated. CONCLUSION: Reduced NAA/Cr and NAA/Cho ratios at 1H MR spectroscopy provide evidence for neuronal abnormality in the frontal cortex of MDMA users; these are correlated with the degree of MDMA exposure. These data suggest that MDMA may be a neurotoxin in humans, as it is in animals.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"7318","Chronic ketamine use increases serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor.^\nRationale: Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist which interferes with the action of excitatory amino acids (EAAs) including glutamate and aspartate. The use of ketamine at subanaesthetic doses has increased because of its psychotomimetic properties. However, long-term ketamine abuse may interfere with memory processes and inhibit the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus, an effect probably mediated by its NMDA antagonist action. Neurotrophins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) serve as survival factors for selected populations of central nervous system neurons, including cholinergic and dopaminergic neurons. In addition, neurotrophins, particularly BDNF, may regulate LTP in the hippocampus and influence synaptic plasticity. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that ketamine use in humans is associated with altered serum levels of neurotrophins. Methods: We measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay the NGF and BDNF serum levels in two groups of subjects: frequent ketamine users and healthy subjects. Results: Our data show that BDNF serum levels were increased in chronic ketamine users as compared to healthy subjects, while NGF levels were not affected by ketamine use. Conclusion: These findings suggest that chronic ketamine intake is associated with increases in BDNF serum levels in humans. Other studies are needed to explore the pharmacological and molecular mechanism by which ketamine, and/or other NMDA antagonists, may induce modification in the production and utilization of BDNF and alter normal brain function.

"8089","Psilocybin-assisted therapy for major depressive disorder: An exploratory placebo-controlled, fixed-order trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Several early phase studies have demonstrated that psilocybin-assisted therapy has rapid-acting and persisting antidepressant effects from just one or two doses. However, methodological limitations (e.g., placebo-control, blinding) limit interpretability of the existing literature. METHODS: In an exploratory placebo-controlled, within-subject, fixed-order study, individuals with moderate to severe major depressive disorder were administered placebo (n = 19) followed by psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg) (n = 15) 4 weeks later. Dosing sessions were embedded within an manualized course of psychotherapy. Enhanced blinding procedures were used. Depression, anxiety, and quality of life were measured over a 16-week study period. RESULTS: Depression and anxiety significantly improved following both placebo and psilocybin with no significant difference in the degree of change between the two conditions. However, antidepressant effect sizes were larger after psilocybin (d' = 1.02-2.27) than after placebo (d' = 0.65-0.99) and there were high rates of response (66.7%) and remission (46.7%) following psilocybin administration. Antidepressant effects following psilocybin persisted, on average, for 2 months and there were persisting improvements in mood-related quality of life domains. The strength of mystical-type experience during psilocybin dosing was not correlated with subsequent antidepressant effects. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this exploratory study highlight the complex interplay between expectancy, therapy effects, and drug/placebo effects in psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy studies. Nonetheless, the acute and persisting clinical improvements observed following psilocybin support further study of its potential in the treatment of major depression. Future studies should more explicitly mitigate and measure expectancy effects and assess the impact of repeated dosing and different forms of psychotherapeutic support.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"8221","The acute effects of MDMA and ethanol administration on electrophysiological correlates of performance monitoring in healthy volunteers.^\nRATIONALE: Knowing how commonly used drugs affect performance monitoring is of great importance, because drug use is often associated with compromised behavioral control. Two of the most commonly used recreational drugs in the western world, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ""ecstasy"") and ethanol (alcohol), are also often used in combination. The error-related negativity (ERN), correct-related negativity (CRN), and N2 are electrophysiological indices of performance monitoring. OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to investigate how ethanol, MDMA, and their co-administration affect performance monitoring as indexed by the electrophysiological correlates. METHODS: Behavioral and EEG data were obtained from 14 healthy volunteers during execution of a speeded choice-reaction-time task after administration of ethanol, MDMA, and combined ethanol and MDMA, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover design. RESULTS: Ethanol significantly reduced ERN amplitudes, while administration of MDMA did not affect the ERN. Co-administration of MDMA and ethanol did not further impair nor ameliorate the effect of ethanol alone. No drug effects on CRN nor N2 were observed. DISCUSSION: A decreased ERN following ethanol administration is in line with previous work and offers further support for the impairing effects of alcohol intoxication on performance monitoring. This impairment may underlie maladaptive behavior in people who are under influence. Moreover, these data demonstrate for the first time that MDMA does not affect performance monitoring nor does it interact with ethanol in this process. These findings corroborate the notion that MDMA leaves central executive functions relatively unaffected.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

METHODS: Sixty-one abstinent recreational users of illicit drugs comprised the participant sample, with 33 females and 28 males, mean age 25.45 years. The three testing sessions involved oral consumption of 100 mg MDMA, 0.42 mg/kg d-methamphetamine, or a matching placebo. The drug administration was counter-balanced, double-blind, and medically supervised. Cognitive performance was assessed during drug peak (3 h) and at 24 h post-dosing time-points. Blood samples were also taken to quantify the levels of drug present at the cognitive testing time-points. RESULTS: Blood concentrations of both methamphetamine and MDMA at drug peak samples were consistent with levels observed in previous studies. The major findings concern poorer performance in the MDMA condition at peak concentration for the trail-making measures and an index of working memory (trend level), and more accurate performance on a choice reaction task within the methamphetamine condition. Most of the differences in performance between the MDMA, methamphetamine, and placebo treatments diminished by the 24-h testing time-point, although some performance improvements subsisted for choice reaction time for the methamphetamine condition.

"8636","Intranasal ketamine for abortive migraine therapy in pediatric patients: a case series.^\nObjectives: Migraine is a common presentation in adolescents and children in emergency departments (EDs) and inpatient visits. It is often treated with nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, dopamine receptor antagonists, triptans, or dihydroergotamine. Some cases, however, are refractory to traditional medications and options become narrowed [1,2]. Restricting therapy further, dihydroergotamine is currently on indefinite shortage [3]. Ketamine, a lipophilic, rapid‐acting, N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, has emerged as a promising therapeutic option [4,5]. Excitatory glutamate signaling may be inhibited by ketamine via NMDA antagonism. This action could suppress cortical spreading depression(CSD) and alleviate migraines with and without aura [5]. Reports in mixed migraine patient populations described statistically significant pain score reductions (7.1 to 3.8; p<0.0001) with intermittent intravenous ketamine[6] and diminished severity with ketamine infusions (0.12‐0.42 mg/kg/hour)[7] without serious adverse effects (AEs) [6,7]. Intranasal (IN) ketamine 25 mg in migraine patients with prolonged aura demonstrated statistically significant reduced aura severity (p=0.032) [4]. Reports of efficacy and safety with IN ketamine (0.3‐0.5 mg/kg/dose) in pediatric patients with various pain diagnoses have been published[ 8‐13], but pediatric migraine data with IN ketamine is lacking. Given minimal evidence and therapeutic options, our experience with IN ketamine was recorded to better understand potential efficacy and safety. Methods: A retrospective case series was performed in 8 pediatric patients (12‐17 years old) with refractory migraine who received IN ketamine between December 2016 and February 2017. In total, 11 encounters were recorded. Pain scores were obtained utilizing a 0‐10 numeric pain scale [14]. Ketamine 0.1‐0.2 mg/kg/dose (mean=0.15 mg/kg/dose) was administered intranasally every 15 minutes (maximum: 5 doses). Results: Migraine resolution was seen in 63.6% of encounters (n=7/11); most responders achieved their lowest pain score with dose four or five (n=5/7; 71.4%). Mean pain reduction from admission to ketamine completion for responders was‐6.8. Non‐responders (n=4) saw only‐0.5 reduction. Mean migraine duration at presentation was longer in responders versus non‐responders (44.6 versus 4 days). Responders also had a nearly 50% shorter mean length of stay (LOS) compared to non‐responders (2.4 versus 4.75 days, respectively). Ketamine was initiated in the ED for 7 encounters; 3 (42.9%) avoided inpatient admission. Vitals were monitored during and 1 hour post‐ketamine administration. The following transient abnormalities were noted: prehypertensive blood pressure[15] (n=8; 72.7%); mild tachycardia[16] (n=4; 36.4%); dizziness (n=2; 18.2%); and dysphoria (n=1; 9.1%). No serious AEs or readmissions within 72 hours were reported. Conclusion: Intranasal ketamine appears to be safe and effective for pediatric migraine treatment, particularly in patients with prolonged migraine. Our experience supports efficacy with lower IN ketamine doses (0.1‐0.2 mg/kg/dose) in abortive migraine therapy with minimal AEs. Larger trials are warranted to substantiate ketamine's efficacy, optimal dose, and safety for abortive migraine therapy in pediatric patients.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"8749","Change in patient-centered outcomes of psychological well-being, sleep, and suicidality following treatment with intravenous ketamine for late-life treatment-resistant depression.^\nOBJECTIVE: To examine whether psychological well-being, sleep, and suicidality improved with treatment with intravenous (IV) ketamine for late-life treatment-resistant depression (TRD). METHODS: This is an analysis of secondary outcomes in an open-label late-life TRD study examining the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of IV ketamine infusions. In the acute phase, participants (N = 25) aged 60 years or older received twice-a-week IV ketamine for 4 weeks. Then, participants with Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score <10 or ≥ 30% reduction from baseline proceeded to the continuation phase, an additional four weeks of once-a-week IV ketamine. The secondary outcomes analyzed here are based on the National Institute of Health Toolbox Psychological Well-Being subscales for Positive Affect and General Life Satisfaction, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and the Scale for Suicidal Ideation. RESULTS: Psychological well-being, sleep, and suicidality improved during the acute phase and those improvements were sustained during the continuation phase. Greater improvements in measures of psychological well-being and sleep were seen in participants who had greater improvements in MADRS scores and moved onto the continuation phase. All but one of the few participants with high suicidality at baseline improved; there were no cases of treatment-emergent suicidality.

"8836","Efficacy and Safety of a Rapid Intravenous Injection of Ketamine 0.5 mg/kg in Treatment-Resistant Major Depression: An Open 4-Week Longitudinal Study.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine has been documented for its rapid antidepressant effects. However, optimal dose and delivery route have not yet been thoroughly investigated. The objectives of this study were to document the safety and test the antidepressant and antisuicidal effects of a single rapid 1-minute injection of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). METHODS: Ten patients with TRD were included in an open, noncontrolled 4-week study and received a rapid intravenous dose of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg. Main outcome measure was the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale and suicidality was assessed using the Scale for Suicide Ideation. RESULTS: Rapid injection of ketamine elicited transient increase of blood pressure and altered states of consciousness in all patients and mild psychotomimetic effects in 4 patients, which all resolved without any intervention. Decrease of depression severity was observed from 40-minute postinjection until day 15. Eight patients became responders within 1 day and all were nonresponders after 4 weeks. The decrease of suicidal ideation was significant until day 7. Analysis indicated that higher severity of depression and anxiety at baseline predicted a larger Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale decrease after 4 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that in well-controlled medical settings with adequate monitoring, a single rapid 1-minute injection of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg can be well tolerated and is efficacious in rapidly reducing depression symptoms and suicidal thoughts in outpatients with TRD. These findings are relevant to the practice of general clinical psychiatry and emergency departments were ketamine can have a place in acute management of TRD.

"8910","Opposite effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on sensorimotor gating in rats versus healthy humans.^\nRATIONALE: Prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle refers to the reduction in the startle response when the startling stimulus is preceded by a weak prepulse stimulus. This phenomenon provides an operational measure of sensorimotor gating that has been found to be reduced in patients with schizophrenia and rats treated with serotonin agonists or serotonin releasers. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we compared the effects of a serotonin releaser, MDMA, on prepulse inhibition in laboratory rats and healthy human volunteers. In particular, we investigated whether MDMA disrupts PPI in humans as observed in animal studies. METHODS: Rats were tested after placebo and MDMA in a counterbalanced order at an interval of 1 week, with separate groups of rats being used for each dose of MDMA (1.7, 5.4 and 17.0 mg/kg). On each test day, rats were first tested after no injections and retested 2 h later, 10 min after a subcutaneous injection of placebo or MDMA. For the human study, a placebo-controlled within-subject design and double-blind procedures were used. Subjects were examined twice at a 2 to 4 week interval after either placebo or drug administration (order being counterbalanced). On each test day, subjects underwent baseline testing including psychological and PPI measures. Ninety minutes later, subjects received placebo or MDMA (1.7 mg/kg PO) and were retested after 75 min during the peak of behavioral effects of MDMA. RESULTS: As expected, MDMA decreased prepulse inhibition in a dose-related fashion in rats. In contrast, a typical recreational dose of MDMA (1.7 mg/kg, orally) increased prepulse inhibition in subjects experiencing robust psychological effects. CONCLUSIONS: This surprising disparity between the effects of the drug in rats and humans may reflect a species-specific difference in the mechanism of action of MDMA or in the behavioral expression of a similar pharmacological effect, or both.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"8923","Single-dose psilocybin-assisted therapy in major depressive disorder: A placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised clinical trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Psilocybin has been suggested as a novel, rapid-acting treatment for depression. Two consecutive doses have been shown to markedly decrease symptom severity in an open-label setting or when compared to a waiting list group. To date, to our knowledge, no other trial compared a single, moderate dose of psilocybin to a placebo condition. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomised clinical trial, 52 participants diagnosed with major depressive disorder and no unstable somatic conditions were allocated to receive either a single, moderate dose (0.215 mg/kg body weight) of psilocybin or placebo in conjunction with psychological support. MADRS and BDI scores were assessed to estimate depression severity, while changes from baseline to 14 days after the intervention were defined as primary endpoints. The trial took place between April 11th, 2019 and October 12th, 2021 at the psychiatric university hospital in Zürich, Switzerland and was registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03715127). FINDINGS: The psilocybin condition showed an absolute decrease in symptom severity of -13.0 points compared to baseline and were significantly larger than those in the placebo condition (95% CI -15.0 to -1.3; Cohens' d = 0.97; P = 0.0011; MADRS) and -13.2 points (95% CI; -13.4 to -1.3; Cohens' d = 0.67; P = 0.019; BDI) 14 days after the intervention. 14/26 (54%) participants met the MADRS remission criteria in the psilocybin condition. INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that a single, moderate dose of psilocybin significantly reduces depressive symptoms compared to a placebo condition for at least two weeks. No serious adverse events were recorded. Larger, multi-centric trials with longer follow-up periods are needed to inform further optimisation of this novel treatment paradigm. FUNDING: The study was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation, Crowdfunding, the Swiss Neuromatrix Foundation, and the Heffter Research Institute.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"9039","Working memory deficits in current and previous users of MDMA ('ecstasy').^\nCurrent and previous users of the drug MDMA ('ecstasy') were tested on measures of central executive functioning, information processing speed, and on self-report measures of arousal and anxiety. The results were compared with those for a control group who did not use MDMA. Relative to the control group, both user groups were found to be impaired in some aspects of central executive functioning. Also, there were significant group differences on the measures of anxiety (users were more anxious) and on arousal (previous users scoring higher on the arousal measure relative to current users). Users processed information as quickly as non-users but less accurately. Some possible mediators of the above group differences are discussed.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"9163","Ecstasy use in New Zealand: Findings from the 1998 and 2001 National Drug Surveys.^\nAims: To examine changes in the use of ecstasy, current conditions of supply, harms resulting from use, and the demographics of users. Methods: National Drug Surveys were conducted in 1998 and 2001. In each survey, a representative national sample of approximately 5500 people aged 15-45 years were asked about their drug use, including ecstasy use, using a Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) system. Response rates of 79% and 80% respectively were achieved. Results: Last-year use of ecstasy increased from 1.5% in 1998, to 3.4% in 2001. Large increases were found among men aged 20-24 (4.3% to 12.5%), and 25-29 (3.2% to 8.8%). In 2001, 43% of users thought ecstasy was easier to obtain and 29% thought the price was lower compared with a year earlier. About one in ten ecstasy users reported problems related to 'energy and vitality', 'financial position', 'health', and 'outlook on life'. Ecstasy users were predominately male, aged 20-29, European and single, but were from a broad range of occupational and income-earning groups. Conclusions: The use of ecstasy in New Zealand increased between 1998 and 2001. Conditions of supply became easier. Users reported problems related to use in a range of areas of their lives. There was little evidence to suggest ecstasy use was limited to high-income-earning professionals. © NZMA.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
